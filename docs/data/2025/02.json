    "content_text": "Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency announced this week that it discovered large batches of unused software licenses as it continues to hunt for examples of waste in Washington. On Monday, DOGE alleged that the General Services Administration has 37,000 licenses for the file compression and encryption tool WinZip, even though the agency has only about 13,000 employees. ‚ÄúFixes are actively in work,‚Äù the team wrote on Musk‚Äôs social media site X. It later alleged similar overspending at the Department of Labor.\nBut the purported discrepancies between licenses and employees may not be as problematic as Musk‚Äôs government wrecking crew has made them out to be.\nLiz Lezius, a spokesperson for the Canadian tech company Alludo, which develops WinZip and was once known as Corel, says licensing for the program is based on the number of devices on which it is installed, not the number of employees with access to the software, though she declined to comment on specific customers. ‚ÄúIt is typical that there are more devices than employees in an organization,‚Äù Lezius tells WIRED.\nIn other cases, suppliers may require agencies to buy a bundle of tools to get access to one they really need, according to Ryan Triplette, executive director of the Coalition for Fair Software Licensing, an advocacy group of software developers and private sector purchasers fighting what they view as restrictive terms.\nAgencies may also have more licenses than employees to account for budgeting quirks and outside contractors, says a former federal official who worked on tech licensing across multiple presidential administrations. ‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre seeing with the DOGE stuff is they are doing cursory work with limited knowledge,‚Äù says the ex-official, who is barred by their employer from speaking to the media. It ‚Äúhas some salience but is done in a bombastic way to make it seem like they are having more impact.‚Äù\nGSA acting press secretary Will Powell tells WIRED that in support of the Trump administration‚Äôs priorities, the agency is reviewing contracts and resources ‚Äúto ensure our staff can perform their mission in support of American taxpayers.‚Äù\nOn Thursday, the DOGE account on X posted that the GSA had taken action this week ‚Äúby deleting 114,163 unused software licenses & 15 underutilized / redundant software products ‚Äî for a total annual savings of $9.6M.‚Äù\nEarlier this week, Musk reposted allegations of overspending at the Labor Department and wrote, ‚ÄúMost of these items are mundane and may not seem like much individually, but there are millions of minor savings that add up to billions of dollars cumulatively. Ultimately, there will be a trillion+ dollars of waste and fraud eliminated.‚Äù\nThe Labor Department and White House, where DOGE is located, didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.\nFederal agencies sometimes sign long-term contracts with software vendors, which allows them to lock in discount rates and avoid the need to renegotiate contracts every year. As a result, the number of licenses they budget for may include projected staff increases. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cheaper to buy them all at once than go back and add on 500 at a time,‚Äù the former federal official says.\nBecause agencies sometimes get bulk or government-specific discounts, it can also be more affordable to buy software licenses on behalf of their private contractors. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very clear way for agencies to manage costs,‚Äù the ex-official says.\nEvery government agency has its own unique structure, including many subagencies or units, each with their own software needs. That could help explain other alleged licensing issues DOGE called out this week, including that GSA has ‚Äú3 different ticketing systems running in parallel‚Äù and multiple tools for running unspecified trainings.\nIn a separate post this week, DOGE called out the Department of Labor for allegedly licensing five cybersecurity programs, each for more than 20,000 users, despite having only about 15,000 employees. The post also cited the department holding 380 Microsoft 365 productivity software licenses with zero users, installing only 30 out of the 128 Microsoft Teams conference rooms it licensed, and using only 22 out of 129 Photoshop licenses. The post also referenced unused licenses for ‚ÄúVSCode,‚Äù the shorthand name for an entirely free Microsoft tool for writing code; the company does sell a paid alternative known as Visual Studio.\nMicrosoft declined to comment. Adobe, which develops Photoshop, did not respond to a request to comment.\nWhile DOGE may have failed to present a full picture of wasteful spending, it‚Äôs true that the federal government has at times struggled to effectively manage its use of software licenses. Numerous watchdog groups inside the government have found instances of wasteful spending on software in the past.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at peard33.24.\nMembers of Congress have been trying for years to get agencies to address the issue, the former federal official says. The Strengthening Agency Management and Oversight of Software Assets Act, or SAMOSA Act, which passed the House last year with bipartisan support but stalled in the Senate, would have required agencies to do what DOGE is doing now: Assess existing software contracts, consolidate licenses where possible, and get better deals to keep costs down. The legislation aimed to give agencies more bargaining power over the handful of big tech firms that dominate government software contracting, according to the former official.\n‚ÄúIf Elon [Musk] wanted to do this the right way, they would work with Congress to pass the SAMOSA Act,‚Äù the official says. ‚ÄúSo people who will be there even when DOGE leaves can enter into smarter, less expensive contracts. They should be setting a repeatable process whereby agencies will constantly reevaluate their software needs and get better performance for lower costs.‚Äù\nTriplette, of the Coalition for Fair Software Licensing, credited DOGE for examining licensing issues. ‚ÄúI know there is a lot of concern about what DOGE is doing, but this is one area that there is hope and possibility,‚Äù she says.\nOther federal contracting experts and congressional offices have told WIRED that DOGE should not lose sight of bigger targets while scrounging for savings. There were 11 federal contracting programs for information technology that each accounted for over $1 billion in spending during the government‚Äôs last fiscal year, which ran from October 2023 through September 2024, according to an analysis for WIRED by Deltek, whose GovWin IQ tool tracks procurement. Contracts are often broken up into smaller pieces, and among those task orders, over $1 billion has been spent on six individual task orders related to IT over the past few years. They are led by a Dell deal with the Department of Veterans Affairs and a Booz Allen Hamilton agreement with the Pentagon.\nBooz Allen Hamilton declined to comment. Its CEO, Horacio Rozanski, told Wall Street last month that the company expected the savings created by DOGE to be reinvested in technology. Dell didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment. Earlier this month, CEO Michael Dell reshared a post by Musk on X. ‚ÄúWe need DOGE! üá∫üá∏‚Äù he wrote.\nThe extent of DOGE‚Äôs software purge is difficult to quantify. In searching for the word ‚Äúlicense‚Äù across the descriptions of 13,800 federal contracts in the government‚Äôs central tracking database that have been updated to reflect terminations since Trump‚Äôs inauguration, WIRED found that roughly 60 of the canceled agreements appear to be explicitly for software. A couple of those cancellations‚Äîdata visualization tool Tableau and Microsoft‚Äôs LinkedIn Recruiter‚Äîgenerated savings of about $4 million, according to DOGE‚Äôs official Wall of Receipts, a ‚Äútransparent account‚Äù of findings and actions. The website has contained some errors, according to several media reports, and WIRED found earlier this week that Tableau and LinkedIn savings were listed as $0.\nWinZip standard licenses run about $35 annually per user, though large organizations are offered \"special pricing,\" according to the product's official website. Lezius, the spokesperson for WinZip developer Alludo, declined to address whether the company has heard from DOGE representatives, but she says the company is ‚Äúalways happy to work with DOGE, GSA, and any customer‚Äù to meet their needs. And, she adds, WinZip, is ‚Äúa trusted and highly affordable way for agencies to adhere to data security requirements.‚Äù\nAdditional reporting by Dhruv Mehrotra.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nAs of today, the Humane Ai Pin is dead‚Äîless than a year since its launch. Following an acquisition by HP, Humane shut down many of the core features of the artificial-intelligence-powered wearable and deleted user data, rendering it useless. Yes, some functions remain, like checking battery life (useful!), but you can't access the voice assistant.\nIf you spent $700 on an Ai Pin, you might be wondering what you can do now. These are the risks of being an early adopter, but not getting a refund on a device that‚Äôs been bricked before the warranty is even up feels like a rip-off. Humane sold roughly 10,000 units, though daily returns were outpacing sales at one point, so there are even fewer Pins in the world. Still, that's thousands of effectively useless devices. It's a blip in the amount of e-waste generated in a year around the world‚Äîalready at a crisis point‚Äîbut Humane really should have offered a more responsible approach with the Ai Pin's demise.\nThere might not be a way to get your money back, though. If you bought the pin in October of 2024 (for some reason), you might fall under the typical 120-day window to issue a chargeback with your credit card. There are some alternative options, however. Let's explore.\nFile a Complaint With the FTC\nKilling a product consumers have spent money on is ‚Äúunfair and deceptive.‚Äù That's what Lucas Gutterman told WIRED via email. He's the campaign director of the Designed to Last campaign at Public Interest Research Groups (PIRG).\n‚ÄúWhen we buy something with advertised features, we should get what we pay for, and when we get ripped off the law should protect us,‚Äù Gutterman says. ‚ÄúI urge everyone who purchased a Humane AI Pin to file a complaint with the FTC so they can step up and protect consumers.‚Äù\nLast year, a coalition of groups like US PIRG and Consumer Reports sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, urging the agency to address ‚Äúsoftware tethering,‚Äù described as the use of software to control and limit the function of a device after someone buys it. The FTC subsequently conducted a study that attempted to determine software support commitments for more than 180 products, only to find that ‚Äúnearly 89 percent of the manufacturer's web pages for these products failed to disclose how long the products would receive software updates.‚Äù\nHumane's warranty states that the ‚Äúsoftware and software functionality‚Äù are excluded, which is often the case on many connected products. But the study also noted that it's deceptive if manufacturers market a device's features but then fail to provide software updates to maintain those capabilities‚Äîit may violate the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act, which was enacted in 1975 to protect consumers from unfair disclaimers in warranties.\n‚ÄúWithout transparent labeling of length of software support, or by taking away key features that were advertised, manufacturers might be violating the FTC Act by deceiving consumers,\" Gutterman says. \"Paying for a $700 product that's supposed to work, and then being told it will suddenly stop working, is a ‚Äòharm consumers cannot avoid,‚Äô although it's one that Humane could have humanely avoided before they shipped e-waste to-be.\"\nYou can file a complaint with the FTC here.\nPressure Humane to Open Up the Software\nSometimes, when companies stop delivering updates to products and shut down core features, a devoted community comes to the rescue to revive or maintain capabilities of the product (or mod it to do something else). We've seen this time and time again, like with the iPod, the Game Boy, or even the Pebble smartwatch.\nThe Humane Ai Pin may not have enough doting admirers up for the task, but this process would be made simpler if Humane released the keys to the software. Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, says Humane should follow Pebble's lead and open the device up. Either that or we'll have to wait for someone to find a vulnerability and jailbreak the Ai Pin to write custom software for it. Humane did not respond to our request for comment.\nWhat could you do with this little wearable pin? Wiens had some ideas. ‚ÄúYou could just use it as a Walkie-Talkie ‚Ä¶ a pin that talks to the internet, has a camera and microphone, sounds pretty cool. It's like a Star Trek communications pin.\"\nDispose or Disassemble It\nIf you want to just get rid of the thing, Wiens says, make sure you remove the battery first and then take it to an e-recycler. We also have a detailed guide on how to responsibly dispose of your electronics. Make sure you do the same for the other accessories that came in the box, though you can easily repurpose Humane's nifty charging adapter and the nice braided cable.\nAlternatively, you can use a service like Grid and have the company deconstruct and frame the Humane Ai Pin, so you can hang it up on the wall and remind yourself every day of the $700 you lost. I know it's a little hard to think about spending more money on this wearable, but at least it'd look cool.\nGrid accepts custom orders, so I asked the company if it would consider the Ai Pin. The answer is yes‚Äîfor a cool $90, which includes design, materials, and shipping. ‚ÄúWe have carefully examined the structure of the Humane Ai Pin and can confirm that we are able to provide a deconstruction and framing service for it. If anyone is interested in preserving their Ai Pin as a unique framed artwork instead of letting it go to waste, they can definitely reach out to us.‚Äù\nYou can email support@gridstudio.cc to inquire about this custom request.\nUse It as a Paperweight or Keep It Safe\nIt's not the heftiest thing in the world, but the Ai Pin can do the complex job of a paperweight. Or you can keep it in the box and put it away somewhere safe. In 50 years, you'll accidentally find it in the attic and then tell your grandkids how this little gadget was once‚Äîfor a fleeting moment‚Äîsupposed to be the next big thing.",

    "content_text": "Alphabet‚Äôs ‚Äúmoonshot factory,‚Äù known as X, has long cultivated craziness in its edgy projects. Perhaps the most outlandish was Loon, which aimed to deliver internet via hundreds of high-flying balloons. Loon eventually ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù from X as a separate Alphabet division, before its parent company determined that the business model simply didn‚Äôt work. By the time that balloon popped in 2021, one of the Loon engineers had already left the project to form a team specifically working on the data transmission part of connectivity‚Äînamely, delivering high-bandwidth internet via laser beams. Think fiber optics without the cables.\nIt‚Äôs not a new idea, but over the past few years, Taara, as the X project is called, has been quietly perfecting real-world implementations. Now, Alphabet is launching a new generation of its technology‚Äîa chip‚Äîthat it says will not only make Taara a viable option to deliver high-speed internet, but potentially usher in a new era where light does much of the work that radio waves do today, only faster.\nThe former Loon engineer who leads Taara is Mahesh Krishnaswamy. Ever since he first went online as a student in his hometown of Chennai, India‚Äîhe had to go to the US embassy to get access to a computer‚Äîhe has been obsessed with connectivity. ‚ÄúSince then, I made it my life's mission to find ways to bring people like me online,‚Äù he tells me at X‚Äôs headquarters in Mountain View, California. He found his way to America and worked at Apple before joining Google in 2013. That‚Äôs where he first got motivated to use light for internet connectivity‚Äînot for transmissions to ground stations, but for high-speed data transfer between balloons. Krishnaswamy left Loon in 2016 to form a team to develop that technology, called Taara.\nMy big question to Krishnaswamy was, who needs it? In the 2010s, companies like Google and Facebook made a big deal of trying to connect ‚Äúthe next billion users‚Äù with wild projects like Loon and high-flying drones. (Facebook even worked on the idea that‚Äôs at the core of Taara‚Äî‚Äúinvisible beams of light ‚Ä¶ that transmit data 10 times faster than current versions,‚Äù as my former colleague Jessi Hempel wrote in 2016. Mark Zuckerberg quietly shut the project down in 2018.) But now, through a variety of approaches, more of the world can get connected. That‚Äôs one reason X cited for ending Loon. Most conspicuously, Elon Musk‚Äôs Starlink can provide internet anywhere in the world, and Amazon is planning a competitor named Kuiper.\nBut Krishnaswamy says the global connectivity problem is far from solved. ‚ÄúToday there are like 3 billion people still unconnected, and there is a dire need to bring them online,‚Äù he says. In addition, many more people, including in the US, have internet speeds that can‚Äôt even support streaming. As for Starlink, he says that in denser areas, a lot of people have to share the transmission, and each of them gets less bandwidth and slower speeds. ‚ÄúWe can offer 10, if not 100 times more bandwidth to an end user than a typical Starlink antenna, and do it for a fraction of the cost,‚Äù he claims, though he seems to be referring to Taara‚Äôs future capabilities and not its current status.\nOver the past few years, Taara has made advances in implementing its technology in the real world. Instead of beaming from space, Taara‚Äôs ‚Äúlight bridges‚Äù‚Äîwhich are about the size of a traffic light‚Äîare earthbound. As X‚Äôs ‚Äúcaptain of moonshots‚Äù Astro Teller puts it, ‚ÄúAs long as these two boxes can see each other, you get 20 gigabits per second, the equivalent of a fiber-optic cable, without having to trench the fiber-optic cable.‚Äù Light bridges have complicated gimbals, mirrors, and lenses to zero in on the right spot to establish and hold the connection. The team has figured out how to compensate for potential line-of-sight interruptions like bird flights, rain, and wind. (Fog is the biggest impediment.) Once the high-speed transmission is completed from light bridge to light bridge, providers still have to use traditional means to get the bits from the bridge to the phone or computer.\nTaara is now a commercial operation, working in more than a dozen countries. One of its successes came in crossing the Congo River. On one side was Brazzaville, which had a direct fiber connection. On the other, Kinshasa, where internet used to cost five times more. A Taara light bridge spanning the 5-kilometer waterway provided Kinshasha with nearly equally cheap internet. Taara was also used at the 2024 Coachella music festival, augmenting what would have been an overwhelmed cellular network. Google itself is using a light bridge to provide high-speed bandwidth to a building on its new Bayview campus where it would have been difficult to extend a fiber cable.\nMohamed-Slim Alouini, a professor at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology who has worked in optics for a decade, describes Taara as ‚Äúa Ferrari‚Äù of fiber-free optical. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fast and reliable but quite expensive.‚Äù He says he spent around $30,000 for the last light bridge setup he bought from Alphabet for testing.\nThat could change with Taara‚Äôs second-generation offering. Taara‚Äôs engineers have used innovative light-augmenting solutions to create a silicon photonic chip that not only will shrink the gadgetry in its light bridges to the size of a fingernail‚Äîreplacing the mechanical gimbals and costly mirrors with solid-state circuitry‚Äîbut will eventually allow a single laser transmitter to pair with multiple receptors. Teller says that Taara‚Äôs technology could trigger the same kind of transformation that we saw when data storage moved from tape drives to disk drives to our current solid-state devices.\nIn the shorter term, Teller and Krishnaswamy hope to see Taara technology used to provide high-bandwidth internet when fiber is unavailable. One use case would be delivering elite connectivity to an island community just offshore. Or providing high-speed internet after a natural disaster. But they also have more ambitious dreams. Teller and Krishnaswamy believe that 6G might be the final iteration to use radio waves. We‚Äôre hitting a wall on the electromagnetic spectrum, they say. Traditional radio frequency bands are congested and running out of available bandwidth, making it harder to meet our growing demand for fast, reliable connectivity. ‚ÄúWe have an enormous worldwide industry that's about to go through a very complex change,‚Äù says Teller. The answer, as he sees it, is light‚Äîwhich he thinks might be the key element in 7G. (You think the hype for 5G was bad? Just wait.)\nProfessor Alouini agrees. ‚ÄúThose of us who are working in the field fully believe that at some point we will need to rely on optics, because the spectrum is getting congested,‚Äù he says. Teller envisions thousands of Taara chips in mesh networks, throwing beams of light, in everything from phones to data centers to autonomous vehicles. ‚ÄúSo to the extent that you buy this, it‚Äôs going to be a very big deal,‚Äù he says.\nIf Teller's predictions of ubiquitous light come to pass, Taara will be in a very good place to capitalize on the explosion. But it won‚Äôt happen within X, or even Alphabet. When I pressed Krishnaswamy, he acknowledged that Taara will ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù from X ‚Äúvery soon.‚Äù It will not become a separate ‚Äúbet‚Äù within Alphabet like former X grad Waymo. Instead, it will be funded by outsiders, with Alphabet retaining a significant stake.\nI‚Äôve covered a number of projects at X, and I have learned that ecstatic noises about a product‚Äôs potential in one moment can be followed by a quiet shutdown several years hence. That‚Äôs part of the X business model, which has failure built into its calculations. But with Taara, and especially its second-generation product, Teller says success is the floor, while the ceiling is higher than one of those now-discarded Loon balloons. ‚ÄúThere's a ton of unknowns, but I would be flabbergasted if it doesn't become a successful business,‚Äù he says. The only question, he says, is how big it could be. Spoken like a true moonshot captain.\nDon't miss future subscriber-only editions of this column.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nI hate to break this to you, but a coffee cup on your drip coffee maker may not be as big as you think it is.\nPerhaps when you bought your 12-cup machine you thought the cup in question was the same 8-ounce cup recognized by Google, your grade school math books, and the measuring cup in your kitchen drawer.\nI‚Äôm sorry to tell you, but this is very much not the case. I test coffee machines for a living and can attest that a ‚Äúcup‚Äù defined by makers of drip coffee machines has nothing to do with the measuring cup you'd use while baking cupcakes. It also bears little relation to the size of an average coffee mug.\nInstead, a coffee ‚Äúcup‚Äù is a weird relic of a different time. It turns out to be a strange and elusive measurement, somewhere between 4 and 6 fluid ounces, as little as half of a standard US measuring cup. Often, a ‚Äúcup‚Äù turns out to be metric. And its precise size will depend entirely on the whims of whoever makes your coffee machine.\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really no standardization for anything in coffee,‚Äù says sales associate Sean Jemison at esteemed Portland, Oregon, coffee supply shop Clive Coffee.\nThe Dutch-made Technivorm MoccaMaster, one of WIRED‚Äôs consistent favorite coffee makers and a perma-guest on our buy-it-for-life guide, marks out a standard cup of coffee as 125 milliliters‚Äîjust a little over 4 ounces. This means a 10-cup MoccaMaster will actually make just four or five mugs of coffee. This same small cup size holds for Sweden's lovely-looking Aarke Coffee Maker.\nMeanwhile, an old Mr. Coffee drip machine demarcates a cup as 5 ounces, the same measure used by the much fancier Ratio Four coffee maker (8/10, WIRED Recommends). But a K-Cup won‚Äôt get out of bed for less than 6 ounces.\nAn average American coffee mug, meanwhile, runs between 8 and 12 ounces, notwithstanding those huge Yeti travel tumblers. So what gives? Why is coffee so weird? Is this a 10-hot-dog, 8-bun situation? Here‚Äôs the rundown.\nThe Mr. Coffee Revolution\nIt's normal, in these times, to be suspicious. And so I forgive you if you assume chicanery. Online coffee forums are littered with commenters who accuse manufacturers of coffee makers of flat-out doctoring the size of a ‚Äúcup‚Äù in order to mislead potential buyers.\nMaybe, maybe not. But the small size of a cup probably has a lot more to do with the history of coffee in the latter half of the 20th century. It turns out that the size of a coffee cup hasn‚Äôt really changed much since the invention of the electric drip coffee machine. It's the coffee drinkers who changed.\nMariella Giovannucci Esposito, the 73-year-old owner of century-old coffee and housewares store Fante‚Äôs Kitchen Shop in South Philadelphia, watched this evolution in real time after she began working at the store in 1971. She took over the shop a decade later, expanding its coffee repertoire.\nIn the early ‚Äô70s, Esposito says, Mr. Coffee ‚Äúrevolutionized‚Äù coffee drinking in this country, for better or worse. People used to mostly make coffee with percolators. Drip coffee existed, but it wasn‚Äôt yet as popular or as easy to make. But with Mr. Coffee‚Äôs new and jaw-droppingly automatic drip coffee machine, the way people drank coffee at home changed entirely.\nThe first Mr. Coffee was a phenomenon, despite costing the equivalent of more than $200 today. But it was new, exciting, and easy to use, and it made a lot of coffee at once. By the end of the 1970s, Mr. Coffee controlled fully half of the American coffee maker market.\nThe standard serving size that Mr. Coffee arrived at was a 5-ounce ‚Äúcup,‚Äù about the size of a British teacup. Though this may seem small now, it actually did correspond to the size of the cups people used for coffee at the time, Esposito says.\nIt‚Äôs also the size that Esposito, a native of Italy, still considers ‚Äúreasonable.‚Äù\nBlame It on the Mermaid\nYou can demarcate coffee cups in America into two periods: B.S. and A.S.\nEverything began to change in the late ‚Äô80s, Esposito says, somewhere around the time a former Xerox salesman named Howard Schultz decided to take a Seattle-founded coffee shop onto the national stage. After Starbucks, coffee cups got bigger.\n‚ÄúThey created their own language for all of their drinks and sizes and everything. So a ‚Äòsmall‚Äô to Starbucks is really kind of like a ‚Äòlarge‚Äô everywhere else,‚Äù says Jemison, the Portland coffee machine salesperson.\n‚ÄúFrom my memory, until Starbucks, most of the coffee drinks were reasonable. I mean, the cups were a reasonable size,‚Äù Esposito confirms to WIRED. ‚ÄúAnd then the larger sizes were introduced.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs probable that mug inflation had already begun prior to the Venti diaspora. But as Starbucks expanded in the ‚Äô90s, Esposito says, other local caf√©s felt the need to compete. The caf√© cups got bigger, and so did her customers‚Äô perceptions of how big a ‚Äúcup‚Äù is.\nNow, when customers arrive at Fante‚Äôs to get a coffee maker, she has to stop to explain that a coffee-machine cup doesn‚Äôt correspond to a measuring cup, and it also doesn‚Äôt correspond to the cup her customers actually drink coffee out of.\n‚ÄúWhen people come in and ask for a coffee maker and they look at ‚Äò12 cups,‚Äô we automatically explain, ‚ÄòThat's not the size of, you know ‚Ä¶ 12 of your cups,‚Äô‚Äù she said.\nJust Double It\nBut even though we drink coffee cups about twice as big as we used to, coffee maker companies have no particular incentive to change their cup sizes. Doing so would make their machine look half as big as it used to be, and half as big as competitors‚Äô.\nThe math, instead, falls on you: You'll need 2 ‚Äúcups‚Äù for one serving, at least if you drink out of a 10-ounce or so coffee mug that‚Äôs now considered standard. It‚Äôll take 4 cups, however, to fill a Yeti mug or one of those Stanley beer steins some folk like to drink coffee out of these days.\nNonstandard cup sizing can often mean you'll need to read the user manual carefully to discover how much coffee to use. Most makers do come with a dosing spoon, for a loosey-goosey approach to coffee ratios, and may also detail a recommended weight of coffee per machine-demarcated cup of water.\nBut if you happen to be a precise person who wants to measure out your coffee to exact specifications by weighing your beans or coffee grounds down to the gram? You‚Äôre going to have to get out your coffee machine‚Äôs manual and read the fine print to discover the ‚Äúcup‚Äù size your machine is using. This may be difficult to figure out, in some cases.\nAs a rule of thumb, American-made machines do tend to have 5-ounce cups. And a 5-ounce cup corresponds to about 140 grams of water. To attain the 17:1 ratio of water-to-coffee often touted as ideal by the international Specialty Coffee Association, each 5-ounce cup would require about 8 grams of coffee.\nYour 10-cup machine, then, will be happiest being poured through about 80 grams of coffee grounds, or nearly 3 ounces of coffee. You‚Äôre welcome. And I‚Äôm sorry.\nFor more coffee advice, check out our guides to cold-brew coffee makers, espresso machines, automatic latte machines, and coffee gifts.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nApple wants to make your events run more smoothly. It has just launched Apple Invites, an app on the iPhone and the web that lets you schedule occasions, invite people to them, and share any related photos and music with your guests.\nIf you‚Äôre an iCloud+ subscriber‚Äîso if you pay Apple money for iCloud storage‚Äîyou can create and manage events, while everyone else is able to respond to invites and participate on event pages. (Yes, even Android users, via the web.)\nWhether or not you've already got a favorite event planning app in place, Apple Invites is worth a look to check out its features and capabilities‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre an iPhone and iCloud+ user.\nCreating and Managing Events\nApple is clearly keen to make the event creation process as straightforward as possible in Apple Invites: From the front screen of the iPhone app, tap the + (plus) button in the top right corner, and you can start building your invite. You've got a few bits of information to fill out here, including the all-important event date and start time.\nTap Add Background to create a backdrop to your event listing, which will replace the colored gradient that's there by default. You can pick an image out from the selection provided, choose a picture from your camera roll, or generate something with AI by tapping on the Playground button.\nYou'll see you can adjust details like the font size for the event invitation, and you'll also see a weather forecast for the event day (if one is available). Choose to add a location to the event‚Äîhandy if you want people to find it‚Äîand the app attaches a map of where the occasion is being held too.\nFurther down the invite creation screen are a couple of fun features: Tap Create Album to attach some photos to the invite, and Add Playlist to build a playlist for the event in Apple Music. You can choose to manage these yourself, or let your guests contribute photos and playlists. Both the photos and music can be added to during the event too.\nAll of these details can be changed if needed as the event approaches. When the invite's ready, tap Preview to see how it looks, then Next to specify the people you want to invite‚Äîthe invite link can be shared across just about any app or platform you like. Turn on the Approve Guests toggle switch to approve guests before they join, otherwise anyone who comes across the link or has it forwarded to them will be able to get involved.\nTap the options button (an icon showing three sliders, top right), and you can make more tweaks to the invite: You're able to specify how many guests your invited contacts can bring (if any), and remove the background preview for anyone who hasn't been approved as a guest. There are also options to duplicate and cancel the event here.\nResponding to Invites and Participating\nHowever your guests get their invite link, they'll be able to tap on it to respond. iPhone owners with Apple Invites installed will get directed to the app, while everyone else will be able to view the invite on the web. If you've turned on guest approval, the contacts you've invited need to request access before they can see the invite.\nThe first order of business on the invite is to respond to it: Going, Not Going, and Maybe are the choices, with the option to attach a message if needed. The RSVP response can be changed at any point, and both hosts and fellow guests can see a list of everyone who's attending on the event page.\nIf photo albums and playlists have been created, guests can view them from the event page, alongside all the other event details. Guests can also add photos to the event album, if sharing access has been granted, and contribute songs to the event playlist‚Äîas long as they're signed up for Apple Music.\nThere are a few guest settings, which can be found by tapping the options button (three sliders, top right). As a guest, you're able to leave the event completely, and specify whether or not you get email notifications about it‚Äîwhich can come in handy if the host changes key details.\nEverything works in a similar way in the iCloud interface: Hosts and guests can see all the details about events, including playlists and photos, while hosts can make any changes they want. More guests can be invited at any point, and it's possible to kick out guests that have already been invited too.\nThe iOS and web Apple Invite apps do a capable job of showing all the events you've created and are going to, and you can scroll through them in chronological order. Both guests and hosts also have the option to add events to their calendar. (Apple Calendar is supported natively, but you can also export a standard ICS calendar event file for use in the calendar app of your choice.)",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is backing away, one by one, from the volley of lawsuits and investigations it brought against cryptocurrency businesses under the Joe Biden administration, in a reversal described by a former attorney at the regulatory agency as ‚Äúunprecedented.‚Äù\nIn the weeks since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the SEC has wasted no time in overhauling its crypto division. The day after the inauguration, the agency established a ‚Äúcrypto task force‚Äù responsible for developing a ‚Äúcomprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets.‚Äù Then, the SEC rebranded its crypto investigations branch into a smaller-scale ‚Äúcyber and emerging technology unit.‚Äù\nOn February 13, a federal judge granted a joint request by the SEC and Binance, the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, to pause their ongoing litigation while they await new rules from the crypto task force. The SEC petitioned for a similar pause on Wednesday in a separate case against Justin Sun, the Chinese crypto entrepreneur who recently announced he had invested $75 million in a crypto project with ties to the Trump family.\nIn the last week alone, the SEC agreed to drop its lawsuit against crypto exchange Coinbase outright, while trading platforms Robinhood and Uniswap, nonfungible token marketplace OpenSea, and crypto software company Consensys all celebrated the apparent end of SEC investigations into their respective crypto activities.\nThe recalibration of the SEC‚Äôs previously adversarial stance toward crypto is meant to afford companies the ‚Äúfreedom to experiment and build interesting things,‚Äù said SEC commissioner Hester Peirce in a recent statement, while still shielding investors from fraud. But others have interpreted the pivot as a signal that the crypto industry will be subject to a far-reduced level of scrutiny.\n‚ÄúThe dismantling of the SEC enforcement program is mammoth. The radical turnabout that the SEC has undertaken in the last month is truly unbelievable,‚Äù says John Stark, who served for 18 years as an attorney at the SEC. Ultimately, he says, the SEC‚Äôs lawsuits against crypto firms ‚Äúare all going to be gone, gone, gone.‚Äù\nThe SEC did not respond to an interview request or a request for comment relating to this story.\nThe New Crypto Game Plan\nDuring the Biden presidency, the SEC was a thorn in the side of crypto businesses, which it repeatedly asserted had violated US securities laws by failing to register with the agency. It was near-impossible to do business in the US, Coinbase told WIRED in 2023, with the constant fear of litigation hanging overhead and without any crypto-specific rules to follow.\nIn response to what crypto businesses considered outright hostility from the SEC under Biden, the industry embarked on a colossal lobbying effort in the lead-up to the 2024 election. Crypto companies and their executives funneled more than $150 million into three super political action committees‚ÄîFairshake, Protect Progress, and Defend American Jobs‚Äîset up to support pro-crypto congressional candidates. Meanwhile, high-profile crypto figures‚Äîamong them Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, cofounders of the crypto platform Gemini, and Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, venture capitalists heavily invested in crypto startups‚Äîcame out in support of Trump. The strategy apparently worked.\nIn July, on the campaign trail, Trump promised a crowd of bitcoiners that he would fire previous SEC chair Gary Gensler if reelected. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know he was that unpopular,‚Äù said Trump, referring to the crowd‚Äôs rapturous response to the pledge. In November, after Trump won the election, the crypto industry got to help handpick the nominee to replace Gensler, landing on Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner who has expressed the view that crypto businesses have been treated unfairly in the US. (Atkins remains sidelined for now, pending confirmation.)\nThe argument advanced by the crypto industry‚Äîthat it was subjected to wrongful lawsuits by a politically motivated regulator‚Äîis likely to have struck a chord with Trump, says Anthony Scaramucci, founder of the crypto-focused investment firm SkyBridge Capital and former communications director for Trump. ‚ÄúTrump is a big believer in lawfare,‚Äù says Scaramucci. ‚ÄúIf you go to Trump saying you‚Äôre a victim of lawfare ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs going to side with that.‚Äù\nAccording to Stand With Crypto, a nonprofit pushing for bespoke crypto regulation in the US, more than 250 pro-crypto representatives were elected to Congress in 2024. The crypto industry claimed high-profile scalps in races in which it had invested most heavily: In Ohio, incumbent Democratic senator Sherrod Brown, depicted as an archvillain in crypto circles, was unseated by Republican Bernie Moreno. Through Defend American Jobs, the crypto industry spent more than $40 million in support of Moreno.\nHaving witnessed the efficacy of the crypto lobbying machine, politicians concerned about the security of their own seats are potentially less likely to voice opposition to the industry in the future, says Scaramucci, which in turn increases the chances of crypto-specific regulation falling into place and crypto-focused legislation making it into law.\n‚ÄúThe Democrats have gotten the life scared out of ‚Äôem,‚Äù says Scaramucci. ‚ÄúYou have to have regulatory clarity. With the Trump administration, you‚Äôll get that. You‚Äôve got enough Democrats scared that will side with [Republicans] to create that.‚Äù\nA Double-Edged Sword\nThe SEC‚Äôs retreat from its outstanding lawsuits against crypto businesses will be received as an early signal of the agency‚Äôs intent to work arm in arm with the industry to come up with a set of rules to govern crypto transactions and products.\nThat rule book will clear up the question at the heart of the lawsuits: Which crypto assets should be classified as securities, the specific type of investment product over which the SEC has jurisdiction, and in what context?\n‚ÄúI think the industry sees regulators willing to work across the table from them,‚Äù says Coy Garrison, a partner at law firm Steptoe and a former SEC attorney. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the difference. Four years ago, the other side of the table was just the enforcement arm.‚Äù\nBut it‚Äôs a mistake to interpret the SEC‚Äôs withdrawal from the crypto-related cases as a total loosening of the leash, claims Garrison. ‚ÄúSometimes, it‚Äôs easy for people to only see the top line,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe SEC is still going to be policing potential fraudulent activity within its jurisdiction relating to crypto.‚Äù\nIt is unlikely that the SEC‚Äôs new stance toward crypto will trigger an immediate proliferation of new crypto products and services in the US. But once the crypto task force has set out its rules, crypto companies will feel emboldened to enter new corners of the US market, sources say.\n‚ÄúThe creativity of the crypto industry knows no bounds,‚Äù says Stark. ‚ÄúFrom retirement money to 529s, exchange-traded funds, asset-backed securities, and derivatives. Expect crypto to infiltrate everywhere. Why not?‚Äù\nMeanwhile, assets like memecoins, a class of crypto coin that typically has no strict purpose but to act as a vehicle for financial speculation, are likely to go unregulated by the SEC. A few days prior to his inauguration, Trump himself launched a memecoin, which was roundly criticized‚Äîincluding by members of the crypto industry‚Äîas an alleged money grab and a potential vector for bribery.\nIn recent lawsuits brought against memecoin platforms and promoters, complainants sought to argue that memecoins meet the definition of a security in certain conditions and should therefore be subject to securities laws. But on Thursday, the SEC put out a statement outlining the view that memecoins do not fall within its jurisdiction.\n‚ÄúThe likelihood of the SEC conducting an investigation into a memecoin is slim to none‚Äîand slim just left town,‚Äù says Stark.\nThe obvious benefits for crypto businesses associated with the changes at the SEC must be weighed against the potential reputational downsides that come with the unwillingness of the new-look agency to police the most unserious and grift-heavy corners of the sector.\nSimilarly, the warmth shown toward the industry by the White House comes with a caveat: Trump appears intent to share in the financial upside through crypto endeavors of his own, which some have argued will heap scorn onto the industry and undermine its search for legitimacy.\n‚ÄúWith Donald Trump, you get the entire buffet table. There‚Äôs no √† la carte,‚Äù says Scaramucci. ‚ÄúYou start with the grifting and self-dealing,‚Äù he alleges. ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre getting some pro-crypto ideas and regulation. You‚Äôve got to eat everything.‚Äù",

Subscribe Today.\nBut First, Sell That Old iPhone!\nIf you‚Äôre upgrading from an iPhone, you can trade it to Apple for a small discount. Before you do that, check whether you can sell it elsewhere for more money. iPhones hold their value incredibly well, particularly if they‚Äôre in mint or good condition. We have a guide that runs through the process of selling your phone, and we generally recommend you use websites like Swappa, Gazelle, or Back Market.\nWe also have a handful of setup guides you should follow:\nBuying From Apple vs. a Carrier\nMost people in the US purchase iPhones from carriers, which means the devices are locked to that network. If you bought an iPhone from Verizon, that means you can't easily switch to another carrier without breaking a contract and paying extra fees. It also poses headaches for travelers who want to use international SIM cards when traveling.\nThe easier approach is to buy directly from Apple, though there are some things you should know:\nConnect to any carrier later: Choose this option for the most hassle-free experience. You get an unlocked iPhone, and then all you need to do is transfer the SIM card from your old iPhone to the new one to get started. This might be painless, though you may need to contact your carrier if the iPhone can't complete the eSIM transfer as it's a carrier-specific feature. Apple hasn't included a SIM tray since 2022's iPhone 14.\nChoose a carrier: If you choose a carrier through Apple.com, you will get an unlocked iPhone no matter which carrier you choose. The downside is that Apple doesn't have the same offers as the carriers, so you may lose out on a deal. However, carrier offers often require new lines, trade-ins, or an upgraded plan, and the savings come in the form of bill credits, so these deals aren't as amazing as they may seem.\nFinance: You can finance your iPhone through Apple either with Apple Card monthly installments, if you have an Apple credit card, or as Apple iPhone Payments. You need to choose a carrier here, but Apple confirmed these devices are all unlocked. You have to fill out a credit application to see if you qualify. If you opt to finance through a carrier on Apple.com, only the T-Mobile and Verizon models will be unlocked. The AT&T and Boost Mobile options are locked iPhones, so it's no different from buying it on an installment plan directly from those carriers.\niPhone Upgrade Program: Buying directly from Apple also nets you access to the iPhone Upgrade Program. Is it worth it? Broadly speaking, no. Most people do not need to upgrade to a new iPhone every single year. It's expensive, though it does include two years of the company's AppleCare+ protection plan. If you really want to get the latest iPhone every year, then this program makes more sense, but it's still expensive.\nWhat‚Äôs the Deal With eSIMs?\nAll iPhone 14 and newer devices completely ditch the physical SIM tray in the US, meaning you can no longer just pop your physical SIM inside to turn on cellular connectivity. Instead, you'll have to rely on an eSIM. You can read more about them here. This tech has been available in iPhones since the iPhone XS and XR, but now you have to use it. When you're setting up your new iPhone, you'll automatically be asked to transfer your number from your previous iPhone, and the whole process should take a few minutes without any hassle. (eSIMs are more secure than physical SIMs.) Once you transfer your number, your physical SIM card won't work anymore.\nThere's a chance you may still run into some issues, especially if you're coming from an Android phone (or want to switch back to an Android phone) or use a carrier that doesn't support eSIM transfer. You'll have to check with your carrier to get your cellular connection in working order again. It shouldn't take long, but it's not as simple as popping in a physical card‚Äîyet.\nWhat Is Apple Intelligence?\nThe most hyped-up feature in the iPhone 16 range is Apple Intelligence, which rolled out in the iOS 18.1 update. This is Apple's suite of artificial intelligence features, following the wave started by the likes of ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Apple Intelligence is also available on the iPhone 16e, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, not to mention select iPads and MacBooks.\nWhat exactly is Apple Intelligence in the first place? It's a collection of features that draw on the power of large language models to introduce ‚Äúsmart‚Äù capabilities. For example, in the Voice Memo and Notes app, you can now start a recording and get a real-time transcription. You can even record a call and get the transcription saved in the Notes app. Siri has been redesigned and can understand when you misspeak, and can even plug into ChatGPT for more powerful responses to open-ended questions. There are writing tools available throughout the operating system that let you change the tone of your emails or proofread text so you don't make an unnecessary typo on Threads.\nThis is just a small sampling, I've boiled down many of the Apple Intelligence features in my iOS 18 guide, and additional features keep rolling out in iOS updates. For example, Genmoji‚Äîwhich lets you create your own emojis‚Äîdebuted alongside the AI image generation app, Image Playground, in iOS 18.2.\nIf you don't care for Apple Intelligence and want to turn it off, you can! We have a helpful guide detailing the exact steps.\nWhat‚Äôs MagSafe?\nMagnetic MagSafe wireless charging is available on the iPhone 12, iPhone 13, iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16 models (except the iPhone 16e), and it allows you to magnetically attach various accessories to the back of the iPhone. You can get first-party accessories like Apple's MagSafe Wireless Charger, which sticks to the back for faster charging. Or snag the MagSafe Wallet so you can keep your credit card attached to your phone. There are plenty of third-party accessories (you'll find quite a few in our guide), and MagSafe doesn't just have to be charging accessories like power banks or wireless chargers. There are a wealth of useful tools, from wallets, tripods and camera cages to notepads and ring lights that can attach to the back of the iPhone and add extra versatility.\nIf you plan to use a case, get one that has MagSafe embedded inside to ensure a strong magnetic connection with Apple's accessories (non-MagSafe cases can interrupt MagSafe and make the magnetic connection weaker). All of the cases in our case guides are MagSafe-tested by yours truly. And yes, a case is a smart investment because iPhones are made of glass, and glass breaks, even if Apple uses ceramic to strengthen it. I cracked my iPhone 16 Plus after a 4-foot drop to the pavement‚Äîthis model's ceramic glass is supposed to be twice as strong as previous iPhones too! Ouch. See my favorite cases for the iPhone 16, iPhone 15, and iPhone 14 ranges.\nThe iPhone‚Äôs Charging Port Is Now USB-C\nThe iPhone 15 range ditched the long-standing Lightning port for USB-C, and it's now in the iPhone 16 range too. This is the same charging port on iPads, MacBooks, Android phones, Windows laptops, and many more personal tech gadgets. USB-C is often called the ‚Äúuniversal port‚Äù because it can technically handle various responsibilities. For example, you can plug in external displays and extend the iPhone's screen or connect the same USB-C accessories you might be currently using on your laptop, like SD card readers. Sadly, it does mean your Lightning accessories won't work unless you get dongles. You can read more about what the new port does here, but there are two important things to note:\nThe iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, and iPhone 16e support the USB 2.0 standard just like the iPhones before, so you'll max out at 480 megabits per second of data transfer speeds.\nThe iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max support the USB 3.0 standard and are capable of up to 10 gigabits per second of data transfer speeds.\nAvoid These iPhones\nThe iPhone 12 and older iPhones are probably available somewhere, but you shouldn't take the bait. They don't have the processing power to keep up with the latest software, and even if they do, they will have a much shorter software shelf life or lack modern features like USB-C. The only older iPhones worth considering at the moment are the iPhone 13 or iPhone 14 series, even better if it's the Pro models if you can find them at low prices. Neither have the USB-C charging port though, which may be annoying.\nThe iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus are cut off from receiving the iOS 18 update, so they're especially ones to avoid. Without software support, your device will slowly become less secure and could become a slow, buggy mess. The camera tech in these models isn't as refined either.\nReplace Your iPhone's Battery\nIf you don't want to spend the money to get a new iPhone, consider a fresh battery. If the biggest issues with your aging iPhone revolve around how long it lasts in a day, replacing the battery might make it feel brand-new. (Apple's iPhone 16, 16 Plus, and 16e have an easier-to-replace battery.)\nReplacements for older iPhones are $89, and $99 or $119 for newer models. If that doesn't do the trick, read our guide on ways to fix your iPhone's problems or our guide on selling your iPhone to get the most money out of it.",

    "content_text": "Startup founder Tara Langdale-Schmidt says her company‚Äôs devices, known as VuVa, are designed to soothe the pelvic and vaginal pain and discomfort that she and millions of other women have experienced. But over the past decade, Langdale-Schmidt alleges, Amazon has repeatedly shut down VuVatech‚Äôs product listings‚Äîsometimes she says for violating what she views as prudish ‚Äúadult‚Äù content rules. Last year, Amazon blocked VuVatech from adding a discount coupon to one product because its automated systems identified the item as ‚Äúpotentially embarrassing or offensive,‚Äù according to a screenshot seen by WIRED.\n‚ÄúWe just have to stop this insanity with being embarrassed about things,‚Äù Langdale-Schmidt says. ‚ÄúThere's no difference from your vagina than your ear, your nose, your mouth. It is another place on your body, and I don't know how we got to this point where it's not OK to talk about it. I just don't get it.‚Äù\nAmazon spokesperson Juliana Karber tells WIRED that no VuVatech products have been blocked for adult policy violations over the past year, though Langdale-Schmidt says that‚Äôs because she‚Äôs given up trying to list new items. Karber adds that Amazon understands the importance of sexual health and wellness products to its customers and has thousands of merchants offering them. The small fraction of those products categorized as ‚Äúadult‚Äù are subject to additional policies ‚Äúto best ensure we serve them to intending customers and not surprise customers who are not looking for them,‚Äù Karber says.\nCompanies and organizations working in sexual health and wellness have for years railed against what they view as excessive restrictions on their content by shopping, advertising, and social platforms. A new survey and an accompanying report shared exclusively with WIRED by the Center for Intimacy Justice, a nonprofit that advocates for more fair online policies and draws some funding from sexual health organizations, underscore just how widespread these concerns are.\nIn the survey, which was completed in March 2024, VuVatech and more than 150 other businesses, nonprofit groups, and content creators spanning six continents reported challenging experiences sharing content about their work, promoting products, and using other services from Amazon, Meta, Google, and TikTok. Those surveyed included organizations offering tools and support for pregnancy, menopause, and other health topics.\nJackie Rotman, founder and CEO of the Center for Intimacy Justice, says ending what she describes as biased censorship against women‚Äôs health would unlock valuable commercial opportunities for tech platforms, and is also simply the right thing to do. ‚ÄúBots, algorithms, and employees who are not knowledgeable in this topic should not be prohibiting women‚Äôs access to important and valuable health products,‚Äù she says.\nGoogle, Meta, TikTok, and Amazon say they stand by their policies, some of which are aimed at protecting minors from encountering potentially sensitive content. The companies also all note that they offer ways for users and advertisers to appeal enforcement actions.\nSome of the offerings cited in the Center for Intimacy Justice‚Äôs survey include unregulated products that have limited or mixed evidence supporting their effectiveness. Complaints about content moderation on tech platforms also extend well beyond sexual health issues. But Rotman, the nonprofit group leader, says its survey findings show how widely sexual health tools and information are suppressed across the internet.\nSixty-four percent of the 28 survey respondents who sold goods on Amazon reported the ecommerce giant had removed their offerings at some point, and about a third of the merchants claimed Amazon had suspended their selling accounts altogether. Karber, the Amazon spokesperson, says that the survey reflects experiences of ‚Äúa very small number of selling partners.‚Äù\nLangdale-Schdmit alleges some versions of the VuVa remain blocked on Amazon today and none are eligible to be featured in paid advertisements. (Amazon bars ads for ‚Äúadult products‚Äù including toys and products promoted for ‚Äúsexual purposes.‚Äù) Despite earning about $6.5 million in lifetime sales, Langdale-Schmidt says VuVatech is losing money, a problem she attributes in part to the volatility of selling on Amazon, which is responsible for half of the company‚Äôs revenue.\nAround 2022, Langdale-Schmidt noticed something else frustrating about Amazon: When she typed ‚Äúvaginal‚Äù into Amazon‚Äôs search bar, it barely triggered any suggested search queries, while ‚Äúerectile‚Äù resulted in a plethora of suggestions, like pills and supplements. ‚ÄúThey took away all the sexual wellness prompts for the word ‚Äòvaginal,‚Äô‚Äù Langdale-Schmidt alleges. For broad search queries, Amazon excludes from the results any product flagged as ‚Äúadult,‚Äù including the VuVa, according to Langdale-Schmidt. This, for instance, prevents someone searching for ‚Äútoy‚Äù from encountering a listing for a dildo.\nThe company‚Äôs adult products policy mentions a variety of sex toys and objects such as dildos and wand massagers, but doesn't specifically list dilators or similar pelvic health devices, such as the VuVa. Amazon‚Äôs Karber says that customers looking for adult products are able to search directly for them using specific search terms or browsing product catalogs.\nA former engineering leader at Amazon theorizes the search bar suggestions for ‚Äúvaginal,‚Äù may be aggressively filtered because algorithms trained on internet content tend to associate women‚Äôs genitalia with porn-related terms. (Oddly, many of the search suggestions for ‚Äúpenis‚Äù include misspellings such as ‚Äúpenisen largement tool.‚Äù)\n‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean Amazon shouldn‚Äôt be pressured to implement smarter search [technology] that can tell the difference between health products and porn,‚Äù says the ex-employee, who was granted anonymity to maintain their professional relationships.\nIn another case from 2023 cited in the Center for Intimacy Justice report, Google limited who was shown some ads from Aquafit Intimate, a small Israeli startup that develops pelvic and vaginal care products. In an email to Aquafit seen by WIRED, a Google representative explained the decision by citing references on Aquafit‚Äôs website to ‚Äúbodily fluids such as vaginal dryness,‚Äù the display of body parts ‚Äúunnecessarily,‚Äù and content about ‚Äúitching‚Äù and ‚Äúburning‚Äù that was likely to trigger a negative reaction among viewers.\nRebecca Sternberg, Aquafit‚Äôs cofounder and CEO, says she and her team tried appealing Google‚Äôs decision twice to no avail. ‚ÄúI said, well, you know vaginal dryness is not a secretion. Quite the opposite,‚Äù she says. Aquafit ultimately gave up on that form of Google advertising.\nGoogle spokesperson Nate Funkhouser says the ‚Äúmoderately restricted‚Äù designation it applied to Aquafit‚Äôs ads under the ad giant‚Äôs sexual content policy was appropriate.\nAquafit continues to buy keyword-based Google search ads without issue, including for the term ‚Äúvaginal dryness.‚Äù Sternberg says the paid promotions are crucial because every dollar spent on them has generally returned $3 or $4 in sales for the Aquafit. But Sternberg remains cautious. ‚ÄúIf Google says you cannot say, you cannot buy the words ‚Äòvaginal,‚Äô ‚Äòitching,‚Äô ‚Äòburning,‚Äô ‚Äòdischarge,‚Äô we're up shit creek,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf we didn't have Google ads, we'd be dead.‚Äù\nOverall, about two-thirds of the 74 businesses and individuals the Center for Intimacy Justice surveyed that advertise on Google reported the tech giant blocked some of their ads, largely citing rules around sexual or inappropriate content. Funkhouser says that Google has long allowed ads for a variety of sexual health products and services, and that last year, it loosened its rules to allow for promoting additional products, including pubic grooming tools.\nThe report alleged that Google‚Äôs biggest online advertising competitor, Meta, unfairly rejected ads for a urinary tract infection treatment and a guide to recognizing sexual coercion, which showed a hand touching a body. Meta spokesperson Daniel Roberts says the UTI ad had violated policies limiting prescription drug ads; the other ad had been incorrectly blocked under a ban on nudity. Roberts says Meta generally allows ads that promote sexual health, wellness, and reproductive products and services.\nAmong the 97 organizations and individuals surveyed who use TikTok, about half reported facing instances of their posts or ads being removed, often without explanation. Some organizations responded that they haven‚Äôt bothered with advertising on TikTok because they feared the company would block their ads. TikTok declined to comment. The video app‚Äôs policies prohibit nudity, restrict content with semi-nudity, and don‚Äôt allow advertising for what it calls sexual \"enhancement\" products.\nSome organizations reported that they have tried to avert potential restrictions on TikTok and other platforms by writing in what is called ‚Äúalgospeak,‚Äù intentionally including misspellings of words or representing them with emojis so that they aren‚Äôt detected by automated filtering systems. For example, sex can become ‚Äúseggs,‚Äù lube turn into ‚Äúloob,‚Äù or the word ‚Äúbutt‚Äù could be represented by the peach emoji. Avoiding proper language can lead to confusion and exacerbate stigmas, some businesses said. But they also felt like they had no choice but to self-censor to get their message out.\nCorrection 12:03 EST 02/28/2025: The story was updated to correct the description of the Center of Intimacy Justice.",

But over the past decade, Langdale-Schmidt alleges, Amazon has repeatedly shut down VuVatech‚Äôs product listings‚Äîsometimes she says for violating what she views as prudish ‚Äúadult‚Äù content rules. Last year, Amazon blocked VuVatech from adding a discount coupon to one product because its automated systems identified the item as ‚Äúpotentially embarrassing or offensive,‚Äù according to a screenshot seen by WIRED.</p><p class=\"paywall\">‚ÄúWe just have to stop this insanity with being embarrassed about things,‚Äù Langdale-Schmidt says. ‚ÄúThere's no difference from your vagina than your ear, your nose, your mouth. It is another place on your body, and I don't know how we got to this point where it's not OK to talk about it. I just don't get it.‚Äù</p><p class=\"paywall\">Amazon spokesperson Juliana Karber tells WIRED that no VuVatech products have been blocked for adult policy violations over the past year, though Langdale-Schmidt says that‚Äôs because she‚Äôs given up trying to list new items. Karber adds that Amazon understands the importance of sexual health and wellness products to its customers and has thousands of merchants offering them. The small fraction of those products categorized as ‚Äúadult‚Äù are subject to additional policies ‚Äúto best ensure we serve them to intending customers and not surprise customers who are not looking for them,‚Äù Karber says.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Companies and organizations working in sexual health and wellness have for years railed against what they view as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-values-internet-sex-censorship/\">excessive restrictions</a> on their content by shopping, advertising, and social platforms. <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"http://intimacyjustice.org/wiredCIJ\"}' data-offer-url=\"http://intimacyjustice.org/wiredCIJ\" href=\"http://intimacyjustice.org/wiredCIJ\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">A new survey and an accompanying report</a> shared exclusively with WIRED by the Center for Intimacy Justice, a nonprofit that advocates for more fair online policies and draws some funding from sexual health organizations, underscore just how widespread these concerns are.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">In the survey, which was completed in March 2024, VuVatech and more than 150 other businesses, nonprofit groups, and content creators spanning six continents reported challenging experiences sharing content about their work, promoting products, and using other services from Amazon, Meta, Google, and TikTok. Those surveyed included organizations offering tools and support for pregnancy, menopause, and other health topics.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Jackie Rotman, founder and CEO of the Center for Intimacy Justice, says ending what she describes as biased censorship against women‚Äôs health would unlock valuable commercial opportunities for tech platforms, and is also simply the right thing to do. ‚ÄúBots, algorithms, and employees who are not knowledgeable in this topic should not be prohibiting women‚Äôs access to important and valuable health products,‚Äù she says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Google, Meta, TikTok, and Amazon say they stand by their policies, some of which are aimed at <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protect-kids-from-adult-content-without-censorship/\">protecting minors</a> from encountering potentially sensitive content. The companies also all note that they offer ways for users and advertisers to appeal enforcement actions.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Some of the offerings cited in the Center for Intimacy Justice‚Äôs survey include unregulated products that have limited or mixed evidence supporting their effectiveness. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/metas-fact-checking-partners-blindsided/\">Complaints</a> about <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/content-moderation/\">content moderation on tech platforms</a> also extend well beyond sexual health issues.

How's everyone doing?\nLauren Goode: I am good. I am feeling better than I was feeling last week, I was a little bit sick. I have to say, I'm excited about a gadget right now.\nZoe Schiffer: Uh-oh.\nMichael Calore: Lauren!\nLauren Goode: I know.\nMichael Calore: You're excited about a gadget.\nLauren Goode: It's like the old days of the Gadget Lab. It's been such a long time since I've been excited about a new piece of hardware, but I am.\nMichael Calore: OK. Is it a Tesla?\nLauren Goode: Yes. It's the model ... Actually, I got all of the models, S, E, X, Y. Isn't that what they're called now? X3. Oh, God. I really bungled that one, didn't I? No, it's not a Tesla. It's not.\nIt's the Oura Ring. It's not new, but new to me. Have you guys heard of the Oura Ring?\nZoe Schiffer: Oh my God. You know this is a personal obsession with mine. I've been wanting one for months, and months, and months. I'm seething with jealousy. Tell us everything.\nLauren Goode: The sleep tracking. I'm not a good sleeper, and this has been giving me some really good insights into my sleep. And stress. I got a stressful email this morning, and I swear, about seven minutes later, the ring had logged that I was stressed.\nZoe Schiffer: It's so obvious when you have a bad night of sleep. You wake up and you feel like trash. The idea that we need our phones to verify this. No, you know when it's happening, and yet I so deeply want the validation. I love the quantified life, I want to be able to see it in numerical form. I'm all in.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Zoe, I could totally see how as a parent of two babies, you would still want that validation. ‚ÄúYes, I am very tired.‚Äù\nIt also gives you something called a Readiness Score, which supposedly signals how ready you are to tackle the day, based on sleep.\nZoe Schiffer: Yet again. though, I'm like, we have no choice. What, I have a low Readiness Score. Sorry, boss, I can't come in. It all feels a little superfluous, and yet I have never wanted a gadget more.\nLauren Goode: And yet. We have to get you one. We have to get you one just so you can go to Katie Drummond, our global editorial director, the next time there is huge breaking news on any of the broligarchy. I need you to say, ‚ÄúKatie, my Readiness Score is suboptimal. I'm not sure I can do this right now.‚Äù\nMichael Calore: Welcome to Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, the power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode, senior writer at WIRED.\nZoe Schiffer: And I'm Zoe Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nMichael Calore: If you've been listening to Uncanny Valley for a while now, you may have noticed something new in your podcast feed. We have added an additional episode.\nLauren Goode: That's right. We have two episodes a week now. There's the one you're listening to with me, Mike, and Zoe. Then each week, there's a shorter, newsier episode with WIRED's global editorial director, Katie Drummond. These episodes have been great. I don't know if you guys have had the chance to listen to the past two, but they're just so good.\nMichael Calore: Oh, yeah.\nLauren Goode: Such clear information. Everyone should check them out.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. We've been super busy at WIRED, covering politics, science, culture, security, and gear, and we'd thought we'd share more of our reporting with you all.\nToday we're talking about three stories from this last month that we just can't stop thinking about.\nMichael Calore: That's right. Today we're going to talk about what is going on in the world of chips. We're going to talk about the Tesla backlash. And we'll walk through a saga involving deepfaked images. OK, let's get into it.\nZoe, you have officially been part of the WIRED team since the beginning of the year. It's been a little over a month. I know you've been working on several stories in your time here. There was a pretty big one that dropped recently and I'm sure it's still at the top of your mind right now, so we want to ask you to talk about it.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. It's funny. I feel like I've been so deep in the Elon Musk, shall I say takeover of the federal government. I keep hesitating. Earlier on the phone with someone I said, \"Elon Musk and his impact on the federal government.\" But, however you want to put it.\nThe story that I can't stop thinking about was a piece that was published last week by two reporters at WIRED, Paresh Dave and Matt Burgess. It's about a woman named Breeze Liu, who's a former venture capitalist and a startup founder, who faced a situation that I think a lot of people fear, have heard about. Which is that in 2020 when she was in college, a friend called her one day and told her that explicit videos and images of her that had been filmed when she was underage without her consent, some were real, some were deepfaked, were spreading around on websites like Pornhub. The impact on her was really profound. She said she lost friends. She contemplated taking her own life.\nInterestingly, while some of the videos were shared on the sites you might think of like Pornhub, the company at the center of the saga is actually Microsoft.\nMichael Calore: How is that?\nLauren Goode: Interesting. Yeah. In what way?\nZoe Schiffer: Isn't that wild? It's interesting because she was I think in college when a friend called her one day and said, \"Hey, videos of you are on Pornhub.\" She was alerted to the fact that this content was out there. It took multiple years for her to ... There were various stages of this where she tried to get it taken down. Sites like Pornhub were actually I think some of the first to comply, to take down the non-consensual images and videos. But then it turned out that a lot of the content was stored on Microsoft's Azure cloud servers. When she contacted Microsoft, she was basically stonewalled for years.\nAt first, the company said that they needed more information from her. Then it allegedly just didn't respond to her for a while. It took her and a colleague actually confronting a member of Microsoft's public policy team at a conference in San Francisco in-person. Her friend was pointing to her being like, \"This is the person. You need to take action. This is impacting her life.\" Finally, after that Microsoft took down a lot of the content.\nLauren Goode: Wow.\nMichael Calore: They approached the Microsoft employee at a conference?\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. At the hotel bar.\nMichael Calore: Wow.\nLauren Goode: Wow.\nZoe Schiffer: Another wrinkle to the story is that she says she was about 17-years-old when the videos were taken without her consent. It put her in this really tricky situation because a lot of the nonprofits and the victim aids groups that could theoretically help her couldn't even watch the content, much less aid with take downs, because it's illegal to host or watch explicit content depicting a minor in the United States. But then when she went to NCMEK, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Kids, they also couldn't help her because she couldn't prove that she was under the age of 18. She was caught in this really weird middle ground that just shows how complicated this issue really is.\nLauren Goode: I have a question. First of all, this is horrific. It's terrible this woman had to go through this, and actually had to confront someone in-person to say, \"I'm the human face of this. Please take care of this. Please fix your policies.\"\nI'm wondering how Azure played a role technically. Since Azure is the cloud storage service, but it's not like people go to azure.com and are searching for things directly through that as a portal. The fact that the images were stored there, did that mean that other websites could then still retrieve them? How did she even know that they were still on Azure?\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. My understanding is that the people who were continuing to share the content were storing it on Azure cloud servers. While they could take it down every time it popped up on a porn website, they wanted to get to the source and say, \"You can't even store this content on Microsoft.\" But Microsoft, it's a behemoth. It's a tech company. I think a lot of us have experienced trying to get technical support for a large tech corporation, which is not great. Not to mention when you have all these other complicated factors involved.\nMichael Calore: Don't the big companies, like Microsoft and other big cloud computing companies, have policies about taking things down? Particularly things that are spread around the web, like her pictures were?\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah, they do. They actually said they updated their policies as a result. They talked to our reporters a fair amount for the story and said, \"No one should have to experience this.\" I think their goal is to respond within a timeframe that's shorter than a couple weeks when someone reports stuff like this. Unfortunately for Breeze, it took over eight months. But they were like, \"We never want that to happen again.\" They're saying they have better contact with the various victim aids groups and are hoping to move faster in the future.\nMichael Calore: OK.\nLauren Goode: You mentioned these advocacy groups that she tapped to try to help her with this. In general, aside from that, what are the mitigating forces here that help keep people safe from it? This could just very easily happen every day and it does.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah, it does.\nLauren Goode: What's the best guardrail we have against this happening?\nZoe Schiffer: I think it's so tricky. I think making enforcement a lot stronger so that the content can't spread is really important. But I know that some of the big tech companies have also said that they're trying to make the cost of sharing this type of content higher. I think Microsoft or Google sued a group of people who were involved in sharing illegal images or videos.\nBut yeah, it's difficult. I feel like when we think about deepfakes, we often think about politicians, like a video of Nancy Pelosi slurring her words that was AI generated. But actually, that type of content is in some ways the least harmful because there's an entire media apparatus around politicians to debunk anything that's misleading. Nudify apps and AI generated, this stuff is spreading in high schools and it's incredibly damaging. If you're a young person who has this type of content spread about you, it can be used to bully you, harass you, blackmail you. I think there's not really an apparatus of support around it. I don't think there's a great understanding of how to handle it.\nLauren Goode: I actually think the Nancy Pelosi example, that was just careful editing, right?\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: The video was edited to slow down her speech and make her sound intoxicated, or whatnot. Since then, we've seen AI generated videos of Zelensky, for example, that are clearly not real.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah, you're exactly right. As I was saying, the Nancy Pelosi example, I thought this was the wrong example to use even though I'm sure there is an actual deepfake of her. But the famous one was just editing.\nLauren Goode: Right. Well, it's interesting the point you make too, about the mitigating forces of media against some of these deepfakes. For example, when Balenciaga Pope came out, there was a moment of, \"Oh, is it real, is it not real? It's gen AI. OK, great.\" But then, we collectively as a society came to the realization it was not real, it was a party trick. Now it exists as a meme, but it does not exist as fact. I think when it comes to someone's personal life, you don't necessarily have all those mitigating forces there to say, \"I didn't want for this to happen. This isn't exactly me. This is now a replicated or altered version of me.\" It's just you shouting into the void.\nZoe Schiffer: Exactly, yeah. Although, I think the Balenciaga Pope was actually an example of a deepfake helping someone's reputation. If you think, he absolutely benefited from that moment.\nMichael Calore: With regards to the nudify apps that people used in order to generate these non-consensual images of the subject in the story that Paresh and Matt wrote. Those have been banned places. States are banning them. Governments are considering banning them in different places like the UK. We've seen that even though the bans come down, and everybody's aware that these apps are terrible, and they get taken from app stores, they still show up.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: People still find ways around those gatekeepers or guardrails to make these apps available. People can download them from different app stores and side load them. You can use them on the web. There's all different ways to make this stuff and it doesn't seem like that's going to be slowing down at all.\nZoe Schiffer: No. I think that's a really good point. I also just think we don't have the collective understanding of this technology to be able to combat it effectively. I can imagine so clearly if a young person did have an image or a video of them floating around that was AI generated, that the perception from adults even if it was literally completely faked would be like, \"Well, they must have done something.\" It's hard to believe that truly, you can just be any regular person, have done nothing. No one deserves to have, regardless of what you've done or not done, non-consensual images or videos float around the internet. But I just think the impact can be so severe regardless of what's actually happened or not.\nLauren Goode: Zoe, what's been the fallout since?\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. Basically, Breeze and her colleague confronted the Microsoft person at the conference, a lot of the content is taken down. During this time period, she has decided to leave her job in venture capital and start an AI company that works to use facial recognition to detect deepfakes on all the websites that we're thinking of. She's actually working in this space trying to fill a gap that she identified as a victim.\nI think she told our reporters that it's not a perfectly happy ending, that the situation has obviously had a profound impact on her life. But I think she's also doing everything in her power to make sure that other people have the support that she didn't have if they're going through something similar. And almost all of the content has been taken down. But even that, the fact that we're saying almost. It's really difficult to scrub this completely from the internet. There is still stuff floating out there.\nMichael Calore: All right. Well, Zoe, thanks for walking us through that story. Let's take a quick break and come right back.\nWelcome back to Uncanny Valley.\nLauren, you're up next. What is the big story that's been on your mind that you would like to share with us?\nLauren Goode: It sounded like I was in the waiting room of a doctor's office.\nMichael Calore: You're up next.\nLauren Goode: \"You're up next.\"\nMichael Calore: I do have my clipboard.\nLauren Goode: Get ready.\nZoe Schiffer: Lauren.\nLauren Goode: I wanted to talk about chips.\nMichael Calore: Nice.\nLauren Goode: As you guys know, I've been out of the office now for a little bit because I've been doing some book work. But I have been keeping up with the news because it's impossible not to. One of the things that has really been fascinating to me is seeing what's going on in the chip market right now. Because it's not just right now, it's this moment we've been accelerating towards for the past several years.\nI think we can't talk about chips without talking about Intel.\nMichael Calore: Oh, boy.\nZoe Schiffer: Ooh.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nZoe Schiffer: Not a company I associate with exciting news, but I am all ears.\nLauren Goode: Intel is one of the defining Silicon Valley companies and it's currently just not in a great place. Last year, its loyalist CEO Pat Gelsinger resigned. Now The Wall Street Journal is reporting that both Broadcom and TSMC are kicking the tires on Intel. They're looking at Intel's chip design business and its hip making factories. If deals like that were to happen, it would effectively split Intel in two.\nWhat is going on with Intel isn't just a tiny emblem of what's going on in the chip market, it's a giant flashing sign that we really are in this new era of chips because our computing needs are just very different.\nMichael Calore: Right. The mobile business, the mobile revolution of the early 2000s, Intel got left out of that. It also got left out of the AI explosion over the last couple of years.\nZoe Schiffer: I feel like I need some table setting at the beginning. Can you just take me through why are chips important? Why do they matter?\nLauren Goode: Well, chips are important because they power the computers we use literally every single day. The ones that we're staring at right now as we record this podcast, and the ones that we drive in, and watch television on, and strap to our bodies, and are powering medical devices. They're just an essential part of our world, semiconductors. There are different kinds of them. There are central processing units, and there are graphics processing units, and there are different flavors of those as well. I think what we're going to talk about in a few minutes is also quantum computing and how that effectively changes the binary units of information that have been processed before in the new era that we're getting into.\nWhat started to happen within the past decade or so is a lot of the emphasis on chip processing started to get more and more focused on AI. What we're starting to see now is chip companies, like Intel for example, which is one of the great defining Silicon Valley companies, starting to experience a pretty significant decline. Then you saw the rise of companies like Nvidia, which was then built on GPUs, very smartly started to tailor those towards AI computing now is on the rise.\nZoe Schiffer: GPUs are just more sophisticated chips?\nLauren Goode: It's for graphics processing in particular. It's not just processing, to boil it down really simply, the type of word processing that we would do on a computer, but actual visual imagery. It treats light differently. It uses something called parallel processing, which is it's executing different tasks simultaneously. In general, it's more powerful. When you think of the early days of graphics, you think of video games on computers. That's graphics processing.\nZoe Schiffer: I feel like we talk a lot in Silicon Valley about companies that are over-valued or people who are paid obscene amounts of money. If you design a GPU, you deserve every dollar. That sounds so complicated.\nLauren Goode: Well, the interesting thing too is that we colloquially will refer to these companies as chip makers, but they're not actually all chip makers. In many instances, they're designers. They're designing the GPU. Or if you're a company like ARM, you have this proprietary intellectual property for the architecture of the chips that we use. Or if you're a company like TSMC, you are literally the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company because you have the fab and you are manufacturing them.\nOne of the things that, here in the US, both Trump and the Biden Administration in recent years have been focused on, is trying to bring more chip manufacturing to the United States. That's an incredibly hard thing to do. It is a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar if not more proposition to try to spin up these fabs, which is why we are still so reliant on companies like TSMC.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. I remember talking to someone about this recently. They were like, \"The US manufacturing chips, that chip can maybe power your microwave.\" I was like, \"Oh, OK. I guess we're not as close as I thought.\"\nLauren Goode: Right.\nMichael Calore: What's going on in the world of quantum chips?\nLauren Goode: Oh my gosh, quantum. How nerdy do we want to get?\nZoe Schiffer: I want to go there.\nLauren Goode: OK. Hands down, the most significant news in chips I think over the past month. The same day that Apple was like, \"Look, we made a slightly cheaper iPhone,\" Microsoft was like, \"Check out the Majorana 1.\" This is basically, it's a quantum computing processor that Microsoft says it's been working on for 17 years.\nZoe Schiffer: What?\nLauren Goode: Which means it's almost old enough to work for DOGE. Yes.\nZoe Schiffer: Lauren, wow. That was low key the best joke we've ever told on Uncanny Valley, and you did it so casually.\nLauren Goode: You're welcome. I don't know how nerdy we should get into what is quantum computing exactly, but it's computer science that uses quantum mechanics to solve problems that are a little bit too complex for classical computers. Classical computers store information in binary form. Then in quantum computer, the units of information are called qubits, folks. The qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously. It's not like on-off in the same way that binary units work. It's just everything everywhere all at once.\nZoe Schiffer: OK. But my understanding was that this is so complicated that you need a quantum computer to vet whether the quantum mechanics are actually ... We don't have a great way of understanding what is actually going on in quantum computing right now. Is that true, or no? We get it now.\nLauren Goode: That sounds right. No, we need a quantum computer to help us with this podcast quite literally, just to explain it. Yeah.\nZoe Schiffer: Put the chip in me, I'm ready.\nLauren Goode: Right. Also, when you ask experts in the field how long they think it's going to take for quantum computing to actually, not necessarily even become mainstream, but just become usable and measurable, you'll hear various things. Some people will say it's going to be a decade at least, some people will say it's going to be 20-years-plus. Sometimes it depends on whether that person is heavily invested in another kind of chip.\nBut regardless, if what Microsoft said bears out, this is a pretty significant advancement I think in quantum computing chips. They're saying, this was reported by The Verge, that the Majorana 1 can potentially fit a million qubits onto a single chip. That's equivalent to the same size of the CPUs that are inside all of the computers that we use now.\nZoe Schiffer: Wild.\nMichael Calore: See, I would say that sounds like a lot of qubits, but also I don't really know how big a qubit is. I have to trust that that is a breakthrough.\nLauren Goode: Chips in general, when you think about them, are just a modern miracle. When you just think about the lithography technology that actually etches these tiny little bits of light into these chips that are the size of our fingernails, and the amount of computing that we can do on them, it's a modern miracle. If this works, this means a single chip with a million qubits could perform simulations that basically help us unlock all of these computing breakthroughs in material science and medicine. It's a big promise of quantum computing. It doesn't mean that we're there yet, but it was quite a mic drop from Microsoft when they announced this.\nMichael Calore: Nice. All right, well thanks for schooling us, Lauren. Let's take another break.\nZoe Schiffer: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley.\nAll right, Mike, it's your turn. What's the story that you're really into right now?\nMichael Calore: I am fascinated by the Tesla backlash.\nZoe Schiffer: I thought you were either going to talk about the Humane AI pin or this, and I would have been really excited for either one. This is probably more important.\nMichael Calore: It is. It is more important. It's quite a ride, so if you're ready, we'll take that ride together. We're going to go full self-driving.\nLauren Goode: Oh, he made a ride joke!\nMichael Calore: I did.\nZoe Schiffer: Woo!\nLauren Goode: What's it called? Isn't there Ridiculous Mode or something in the car?\nMichael Calore: Yeah, Ludicrous Mode.\nLauren Goode: Ludicrous.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Let's go into Ludicrous Mode.\nZoe Schiffer: OK. Set the scene for us.\nMichael Calore: We have to go back to the end of 2024, because 2024 was Tesla's first down year. The company opened the year by saying that its deliveries of new cars had shrank by 1.1% in 2024. Which does not sound like a huge number, but it's pretty significant considering how many cars Tesla ships. The stock price had already begun to dip at the end of 2024. But at this point, Tesla really goes into a slump. There are some blunt economic reasons for this that we should talk about.\nFirst of all, there's a lot of increased competition from other automakers who are building more EVs, particularly from China where EVs are cheaper. There's a company called BYD which is eating into Tesla's market share in China and in Europe. The company also suffers from a lot of manufacturing slowdowns, supply chain woes that the rest of the auto industry is suffering from. And there are a lot of folks that are just waiting. There's a new Tesla model due in 2025 and they don't want to buy a Tesla at the beginning of 2025 or the end of 2024.\nBut we can't talk about Tesla's financial slump without talking about Elon Musk's involvement in politics because the two are connected.\nZoe Schiffer: I'm very excited about this because my understanding was that, for a very long time, the fact that Tesla was such a widely-traded retail stock and Elon had such a close relationship with his fan base ... His fan base was pretty rabid, and into him and into Tesla. That Tesla could go through the ups and downs of any business, but stock price stayed really high because people were obsessed with Elon. But that seems like it's starting to change?\nMichael Calore: Yes. There's a measurable turn that happens at the beginning of the year. Starting back in 2024, Elon Musk was campaigning for Donald Trump. He threw a bunch of money into the campaign and he started supporting conservative causes more vocally on X. That just immediately alienated half of the country. Then Donald Trump tasked Elon Musk with running the so-called Department of Government Efficiency in Washington. More people get upset that this billionaire is messing around with our government systems. That sours people on Elon Musk's allure a little bit more.\nThen of course, something extraordinary happens on January 20th, 2025. At Trump's inauguration rally, Elon twice made what we shall call a one-armed gesture toward the crowd. It looked a lot like a fascist salute. It was certainly Nazi-like in appearance. It really solidified for a lot of people, liberals and conservatives alike, that they felt like they should just reject this guy's ideology. Which means rejecting him and rejecting his products that his companies make. If there was any question about Elon's politics, we know now that he's been very vocal in his support for AFD in Germany, which is a far-right party in Germany.\nWe can see this turn against Tesla manifest in two ways. There's the financial response. Tesla's drop in sales was most notable in Europe in January. I'm going to quote some stats at you because they were very stark. In Germany, Tesla's year-over-year sales in January fell by 59%. In France, they fell by 63%.\nLauren Goode: Whoa!\nMichael Calore: In Spain, they fell by 75%.\nZoe Schiffer: Oh my gosh.\nMichael Calore: In the UK, they fell by 12%. But in Norway, the country where there are more EVs than internal combustion cars on the road, Tesla registrations are down 38%.\nZoe Schiffer: That is so high. That's way higher than I would have thought.\nMichael Calore: It is. Some of those drops are because of the problems that we outlined earlier. The cheap EVs, the age of Tesla's auto line, the fact that a lot of people were just not wanting to buy a Tesla now. But auto industry experts have been saying that it's impossible to measure the effect that the public's distaste for politics are having on sales, but they are certainly contributing.\nLauren Goode: Are those places where people were more inclined to have lots of Teslas to begin with, so therefore the drops seem precipitous?\nMichael Calore: Yes and no. Tesla is still a very big presence in the EV world, but more car manufacturers are making electrics. In this country, we have Ford, and GM, and Chevrolet all putting out new electrics this year and last year. In Europe, you've got brands like Volvo, and Polestar, and Audi, and Volkswagen also making a lot of EVs. They are selling in Europe. They're certainly not selling as much now.\nLauren Goode: I've also wondered if part of this could just be that we're in that five to seven year post-purchase period where people are like, \"Oh, I don't actually want a full-on electric car. I don't want to deal with the battery maintenance. The resell market is poor because of that.\" If there are other factors here aside from the ideologies, which also seem like a very real part of this.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Factors for the sales dipping?\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: Yes, for sure. There's still a lot of anxiety around electrics. People are afraid to buy them because they don't know where they'll be able to charge them, or whether they're going to get access to a fast charger. Ever since the Trump Administration has come into power, they have been cutting back on infrastructure projects that were there in order to provide more chargers in more places around the United States.\nZoe Schiffer: Is the Cybertruck part of this, too? Because I feel like I remember reading very disparate things about the rollout. Where there were tons and tons of people on the wait list to get it, and then sales were lower maybe at the beginning. Where does that play into all of this?\nMichael Calore: Well, I think the Cybertruck is really interesting because it's at the center of the debate of how you feel about Tesla.\nZoe Schiffer: Because it's the most obvious?\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Well, it's such an expression of masculinity.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. It's an expression of something, that's for sure. Who's the person who buys a Cybertruck? Are they the person who needs to haul things around? Are they the person who is a prepper and they want the most indestructible, bulletproof, waterproof vehicle they can buy? Is it somebody who just needs to take up a lot of space on the road?\nLauren Goode: Mike, the next time I drive down to Palo Alto, because I literally just drove down there the other day and I saw four in one trip to Palo Alto, I'm going to take you with me just so you can have fun counting them.\nMichael Calore: OK.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I remember when I first moved to Silicon Valley in 2013. I quite literally lived on Sand Hill Road because I was in Stanford-adjacent housing.\nZoe Schiffer: She couldn't not mention it, you guys. She just simply could not.\nLauren Goode: The junior university, OK. When we first moved, my then partner and I used to count the number of Teslas we saw driving up and and down Sand Hill Road because it was still new. I thought they were very cool looking cars. They were these shark-y, sleek vehicles. Then over time, it just stopped counting. They were just literally everywhere.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Now with the Cybertruck, I feel like it's at square one again. I can count on one hand the number that I see in one trek down the Valley.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. It's been that way for a long time and it remains that way, just because there are so many Teslas here in California. California is the world's center of Teslas. The California Camry, that's what people call it. The Tesla owners love it when you call it a California Camry, by the way.\nZoe Schiffer: That's so funny.\nMichael Calore: But everybody's counting Teslas again because the second part where we can measure the backlash is the cultural response to all of this madness. I'm sure you've seen the bumper stickers that people are putting on their Teslas, \"I bought this before I knew Elon was crazy?\"\nZoe Schiffer: Yes, I was going to mention them.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Hashtag swasticar is often trending on social media.\nLauren Goode: Wow!\nZoe Schiffer: Oh my God.\nMichael Calore: There are activists that are spray-painting swastikas on Teslas. The showrooms are getting vandalized with anti-Nazi vandalism. There was famously in Berlin, the Tesla factory there, some activists projected Elon doing his Nazi-like arm gesture on the side of the building and it said \"Heil Tesla\" on it.\nThis all culminated in the middle of February with an event called Tesla Takedown, where thousands of people all around the country descended on Tesla showrooms and protested Elon's involvement in the US government and protested Tesla ownership in general.\nIt's not really the best time to be driving one of those cars if you're somebody who is ideologically opposed to Elon. What do you do, do you sell it? Do you sell it at whatever you can get for it because you just want it out of your life? Or do you hold onto it? I know there's a lot of people who are wrestling with that right now.\nZoe Schiffer: That's really, really interesting. I'm curious if it's impacting his other companies, because Elon famously runs SpaceX, Neuralink, xAI, X.\nLauren Goode: The US government.\nMichael Calore: The US government.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah, also that.\nMichael Calore: It's certainly affecting X. There's a lot of people who are like, \"I'm out of here. I don't want to be a part of this guy's social network anymore.\" But the only other Elon-owned entity that I've heard anecdotally people are shying away from is Starlink. There are people who have long been interested in satellite internet who are now exploring other connectivity options because of his politics.\nZoe Schiffer: And all the people who are signing up to go to Mars are now canceling those reservations, so that's a bummer.\nMichael Calore: Were people signing up?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I was going to say, were people signing up to go to Mars?\nZoe Schiffer: No, that was a joke. That was a bad joke. I just was trying to be funny.\nLauren Goode: That's the world we live in though now, Zoe. That could be real. That could really be happening.\nZoe Schiffer: Right. Although Elon does say that he wants to die on Mars, but ha ha, not on impact. That's a joke he makes a lot.\nMichael Calore: Oh, boy.\nLauren Goode: The most amazing thing about the Cybertruck is just seeing how much space it takes up. It is such a huge, protruding vehicle. It's literally parked outside of this quaint, little coffee shop in Palo Alto with flower baskets, and then you see this war vehicle, this militarized vehicle just sitting in front. It's so wild to see. It's massive.\nZoe Schiffer: It does have the feeling of the vehicle version of a man spreading his legs on the subway really wide.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nZoe Schiffer: That said, if we have any listeners who are owners of the Cybertruck and you want to talk about why you like it, I'm genuinely curious. Write to us.\nLauren Goode: Do we think Elon Musk cares that there has been this cultural reaction to his antics that have resulted in this sales drop? I think that's my final question.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. I don't know. In my experience talking to people who've worked closely with him or associated with him over the years, he's not completely un-self-reflective. I think he can be introspective at different moments. But I don't know, he seems like he's more and more insular these days. He is in a bubble. And while he's getting a ton of opposition, and hate, and feedback all the time, he's more and more insulated from it, ignoring it. Even maybe energized by it because he sees himself as the good guy, the hero, the person trying to save America or the rest of the world and people are trying to stop him. You can really tell when he's talking on these podcasts or on X Live, or whatever, he sees the people who are opposed to him as the authoritarian censors, the people trying to bring down the good guys. He sees himself as the hero.\nLauren Goode: This is also a snapshot of data for this snapshot in time. Tesla's had a lot of highs and lows since its inception. It's not to say that this is the beginning of the end of Tesla in any way. It's just notable that this is happening all on the heels of him essentially becoming one of the key advisors to the government.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Financial experts are saying that the dip will continue, but it is most likely not the end of the company and it's not the end of the story. However, it is the end of the podcast because we have to wrap this up.\nThank you for listening to Uncanny Valley.

Learn more.\nWhen Framework‚Äôs repairable and upgradeable Laptop 13 came out a few years ago, it was exactly the disruption we needed in the portable computing space. Here was a laptop that let you customize its guts when ordering, then you could upgrade or repair various components as needed. It was expensive, but you wouldn't have to shell out a wad of cash for a new laptop every five years just because you don't have enough RAM.\nThe company is back to do it again. Earlier this week, Framework announced the Laptop 12 alongside a new desktop PC. The Laptop 12 is a budget laptop that doesn‚Äôt look awful, is fully modular, and doesn‚Äôt skimp on the performance and display. If it sounds too good to be true, you‚Äôre not alone. We don‚Äôt know the price yet, which is incredibly important. But keeping it a ‚Äúbudget‚Äù laptop is Framework‚Äôs stated goal.\n‚ÄúWe build products to fix what we see as a broken industry, and few categories are as emblematic of the problems with consumer electronics as entry-level laptops,‚Äù says Framework CEO Nirav Patel on the company‚Äôs blog. Whether or not Framework has the antidote, Patel is right about the diagnosis. Shopping for a cheap Windows laptop today will leave you depressed about the state of the industry. They're often underpowered and slow, not to mention quite ugly.\nChromebook Killer\nThe Framework Laptop 12 has a small 12.2-inch screen, hence the name. But it's a convertible 2-in-1 laptop, meaning it has a 360-degree hinge that lets you flip the screen around to use it as a tablet. With that comes a touchscreen and optional stylus‚Äîa first for Framework.\nWe're still missing several details to complete the picture, like the laptop's thickness and weight‚Äîthose details will arrive when preorders open up in April‚Äîbut photos of the machine show a stylish PC that looks better than any budget laptop I've ever seen. The five bold, new color options don‚Äôt hurt either.\nIt has some very thick bezels around the display, though, something you won‚Äôt find outside the budget Chromebook world these days. The Laptop 12 makes up for it by ensuring the display is better than what you'd typically find on a budget laptop. It has a 1920 X 1200-pixel resolution and up to 400 nits of brightness (the MacBook Air tops out at 500 nits).\nFramework's key selling point once again is modularity. Unlike Chromebooks‚Äîand virtually all Windows laptops‚Äîthe Framework Laptop 12 is fully modular, just like its bigger siblings. The Mainboard system is still in place, allowing you to easily swap out the CPU (and attached motherboard) for something more up-to-date years down the line. It's so easy that an IT administrator could upgrade a boatload of these PCs in just a few hours.\nEverything else is removable too, including storage, memory, the Wi-Fi card, the keyboard, the battery, and more. As revealed by one of its investors, the keyboard and RAM are easier to replace this time around‚ÄîFramework itself claims that the Laptop 12 is its ‚Äúeasiest product ever to repair.‚Äù At the very least, you no longer have to remove the flat ribbon cable connected to the keyboard, which was a fragile component of the repair process in previous iterations.\nModularity and repairability will be what drives these machines into the hands of educators and IT managers. A fleet of these babies could last many, many more years than some old, chunky Chromebooks‚Äîand probably make the students and faculty more happy with an up-to-date machine. Framework even says students are its target audience here, using ‚Äúovermolded shock-absorbing‚Äù materials over the plastic and metal structure to make it durable.\nModular ports have become Framework's calling card, and the Framework Laptop 12 has four, not counting the headphone jack. Having the flexibility to choose what ports you get is fantastic, and in this model those ports can be locked in place from the inside.\nPricing remains the biggest point of contention. After all, we live in a time when you can buy an M1 MacBook Air for $629. While Apple's machine is more than four years old, its performance and battery life will likely still run circles around the 13th-gen Core i3 Intel processor employed by the Framework Laptop 12. You can even buy a previous-gen Asus Zenbook OLED 14 for just $550.\nNeither the MacBook nor the Zenbook have the modular features of the Framework Laptop 12. If the company nails the right price for this machine, it could be a fresh start for budget laptops, and it could mean sending less e-waste to the landfill.",

I'm WIRED's global editorial director, Katie Drummond. Today on the show the many conflicts of interest at the heart of DOGE and the email Elon Musk sent to federal workers over the weekend. I'm joined today by WIRED's executive editor, Brian Barrett. Brian, welcome to Uncanny Valley.\nBrian Barrett: Hey Katie. Thanks so much.\nKatie Drummond: All right, so Brian, let's get right into it. Over the last several weeks, we have been chronicling a number of conflicts of interest within DOGE that are popping up across federal agencies, across the federal government, including a story that we actually just published on WIRED.com today, one this time at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Tell everyone a little bit about this story in particular.\nBrian Barrett: Sure. This is a story that I think speaks to some of the bigger issues around the conflict of interest that you were just talking about. What we are reporting has shown is that there are two people working at the Department of Housing Urban Development that both have ties to the real estate industry. One of them in fact is a guy named Scott Langmack. He is currently also the chief operating officer of a company called Kukun, which is spelled K-U-K-U-N.\nKatie Drummond: Why not?\nBrian Barrett: And so Kukun is a company that works to get information to homeowners and real estate investors about how much return on investment they'll get if they renovate their properties. And it also helps them predict where property values are going to rise in the future so they can make smarter investments. Obviously all this involves a lot of data. And what does HUD have? A lot of data about housing. So what we're seeing is that Langmack and another guy from DOGE, his name is Michael Mirsky, have access to three major systems within DOGE that gives them information about what kind of money is flowing through, who's getting public housing assistance, who has permissions to which systems. It's a lot, and I think there's sort of a very apparent conflict of interest in that.\nKatie Drummond: And tell me more about Michael Mirsky.\nBrian Barrett: Yeah, so Michael Mirsky also has these ties. He works for a place called TCC Management. It's a company based in Michigan that owns and operates mobile home parks across the U.S. And he also has some of these same privileges, he has write privileges to the systems that control who has access to what. And HUD does a lot of work that would implicate both these types of companies. HUD especially in terms of the mobile home business does a lot of work with lower income families and homeowners that intersects a lot with the mobile home industry. There's just sort of these layers of potential conflicts, people getting data that could help them when they return to their jobs if they're not currently working with their jobs, not really people that you would expect to be in these positions.\nKatie Drummond: And just to be totally clear as far as our reporting shows, as far as what we know, both Langmack and Mirsky still hold their current roles in the private sector while working within this federal housing for DOGE.\nBrian Barrett: So Kukun and Langmack did not get back to us, so his status is unknown, but as far as we can tell, his LinkedIn still has him there, all of his profiles still him there. And we did hear from the mobile home company. The company is called TCC Management. They say that he's taking a six-month leave of absence, that he'll be back in July. So he is on break it seems, but will be going right back to the company with whatever he has learned in the process.\nAnd we've seen other instances across the government where representatives of DOGE are keeping two jobs at once. We've got Tom Krause of Treasury, who is also the CEO of the Cloud Software Group, which has millions of dollars of contracts with the Treasury Department. So it's part of this pattern that we're seeing of people who are in positions of power in the government with a lot of potential to benefit their private business lives. I think the focus of our reporting is just the fact of the conflict of interest and even the appearance of the conflict of interest used to be enough to sort of prevent these sorts of situations from happening. That has gone out the window with DOGE.\nKatie Drummond: Absolutely. You would like to assume that someone working within a federal agency in a position that is essentially as a civil servant is working in the best interests of Americans, and that their intentions in a role like that are to serve the American people. That's sort of the whole point. Obviously, and to your point, exactly whether or not he's doing anything with the data that he has or with the sort of privileged position that he has within this agency, even the appearance of a conflict of interest is problematic enough.\nBrian Barrett: And as we've been reporting on this at other agencies, we did some digging into sort of historical precedent. Then you really have to go back to World War I and World War II to a time when people worked two jobs at once. There were people called dollar a year men or whatever, who were helping out the government during war time and took a dollar salary from the government, also stayed at their companies. And that actually turned out to be pretty problematic. There were a lot of congressional investigations into issues that sprung up around that.\nSo we're revisiting those sort of bad old days in some ways for no reason other than that people just don't care anymore. There's no national emergency that is causing this. It's just Elon Musk thinks it's fine, so it's fine.\nKatie Drummond: Right. Elon Musk thinks it's fine. And let's go back to what you mentioned about Treasury and Tom Krause a little bit because that was a story we published recently, sort of highlighting another specific instance of this kind of conflict of interest. So tell us a little more about what we know about Krause, his two jobs and what exactly he's doing inside the Department of Treasury right now.\nBrian Barrett: So Tom Krause is DOGE's representative at Treasury. He is in charge of overseeing these systems as part of his job that are responsible for payouts in the trillions of dollars every year, the sort of main payout systems of the federal government. There's been a lot of legal back and forth over whether he can actually access those systems directly. So that remains to be a little bit in flux.\nBut importantly, he is also openly also the CEO of Cloud Software Group. When he took the position, Cloud Software Group confirmed that he was still CEO there, Treasury sent out a note saying, yes, he's still the CEO there. So he is, no bones about it, fully serving in both capacities. Why not do both? What we reported on more recently is that Cloud Software Group actually has tens of millions of dollars of active contracts with the US government, including over 10 million as I mentioned with the Treasury Department itself.\nAgain, there's no indication yet that anything bad has happened yet, that there is any self-dealing. But when his company's software comes up for renewal for a contract, do we think it'll get it or do we think they'll go with someone else? We'll see. But it's just so obviously, again, on its face, a conflict of interest. And again, the appearance of conflict of interest and that there's no attempt to even pretend that there is a separation of church and state.\nKatie Drummond: In sort of a bigger picture way, when we talk about DOGE and its operatives and Musk acolytes being installed in these agencies, I think the important bigger picture context there that you've alluded to is that Elon Musk himself is one giant conflict of interest within the federal government. This guy owns and operates a multitude of companies, many of which have a lot of dealings with various parts of the federal government, a lot of contracts, a lot of financial entanglements.\nAnd I think one that is particularly interesting to me that we've reported on recently is actually the FAA. We've reported that SpaceX engineers are now working within that agency. Obviously that agency has had a lot to do with SpaceX and sort of what that company has been able to accomplish or not accomplish in the United States. The FAA has levied fines against SpaceX several times as far as I'm aware.\nCan you talk a little bit more about the question of Elon, and particularly in the context of SpaceX, which is to be fair to him, I think one of the biggest success stories in the Musk empire is SpaceX, which has done some genuinely pretty incredible things, but obviously is now sort of right at the heart of this question of conflict of interest.\nBrian Barrett: And so we'll talk about the FAA specifically first because I think the circumstances under which people from SpaceX joined the FAA is just as interesting in some ways as what they're doing. So a little bit of background, Sean Duffy, who is currently heading up the FAA the other week said, we've got some SpaceX engineers coming through. They're just on a tour. They're just on a tour. They're just being given the lay of the land. Nothing more than that.\nOur reporting shows that in fact, at least three of those engineers were being onboarded already. And not only that, they were being onboarded without getting the typical clearances you would expect because they use something called Schedule A to get them into the FAA. And Schedule A is designed to help expedite the hiring of people with disabilities.\nKatie Drummond: Classy.\nBrian Barrett: Yeah, very classy. And so they've been in there under sort of doubly cloudy circumstances. So that's worth noting first of all. Second of all, yes, the people who are in there are engineers. Who knows what they're working on. In some ways they're probably not working on actual contracts, but they might be, we don't know. And I think that's the bigger problem is that we have these people going into these agencies doing who knows what? What are they doing with the data? Are they taking it somewhere else? Are they feeding it into the AI? At some agencies that's true. If they can see all the contracts that the FAA has with SpaceX competitors, what are they doing with that information?\nIt is just giving themselves this fire hose under the auspices of we're going to fix air traffic control. Meanwhile, they're telling air traffic controllers, they'll be fired if they don't write back to an email. They're firing thousands of FAA employees. It seems like there is just a very central failure to think through or to process what is actually holistically good for the FAA. It is this idea we're going to chop off the FAA's and we're going to throw in these four dudes who are going to fix everything. It just doesn't make sense.\nAnd again, as you said, as we've said repeatedly raises so many questions about how much inside intel is Elon Musk getting at all of these agencies, and especially one where he has so much business.\nKatie Drummond: Absolutely. And of course, important to mention here, as President Trump said a few weeks ago, if Elon does encounter a conflict of interest, he will simply recuse himself. Obviously that was said with a great deal of sarcasm. Remains to be seen what conflicts of interest will present themselves next from within DOGE because I have a feeling these are not the last stories that WIRED will be publishing on this topic. We're going to take a short break. We'll be back with Brian Barrett in a minute.\nWelcome back to Uncanny Valley. So Brian, let's talk about the email. Over the weekend, WIRED had a team of reporters furiously working to cover an email that went out from the Office of Personnel Management, so essentially the federal government's HR apparatus, and that was touted by Elon Musk on X. So ostensibly, this email is coming from the heart and mind of Musk himself, is the impression that we have essentially telling federal workers to send a productivity report back to OPM by Monday at midnight or they would be fired. That's how things started on Saturday. They unraveled pretty quickly after that. Brian, tell us a little bit more about what has transpired.\nBrian Barrett: Well, and I'll start, just to clarify too, I think an important part of this is the initial email didn't say they would be fired if they didn't respond. The email itself just said, send us a bulleted list of five things of what you did last week. And then Elon separately on X tweeted, by the way, if you don't write back, you're going to be forced to resign.\nKatie Drummond: I hope that all sort of 2.3 million federal workers are checking X regularly or they will apparently miss important updates about their employment status from the government.\nBrian Barrett: And truly, I talked to one person who works at the federal government who has muted Elon Musk on X and had not seen it until late Monday. So that's just part of the chaos that ensued. The other part, and the bigger picture part is that leadership at all of these agencies seemed to have no idea this was coming. It was just a bomb dropped in the middle of the weekend on the federal workforce. And because of that, there was a scramble at every agency figuring out how to respond. At NOAA, there was a sense of don't respond yet. It might be a phishing email. Let's figure it out. Then once they decided=\nKatie Drummond: It sure seems like spam.\nBrian Barrett: Yeah, it does. At other agencies, there was sort of, in general there's a sense of like, let's hold, let's wait until Monday and you'll get more guidance. Then meanwhile, some people are already writing back to the email. Some people aren't. Some people haven't even seen it. Then some agencies started to take a stand, including reportedly the FBI, where Kash Patel, who is maybe the most loyal of Trump loyalists in these positions, apparently drew a line and said, \"No, don't write back to this.\" The State Department also said, \"Absolutely not. You're not doing this.\" And then we sort of saw mixed guidance at NIH. There was sort of yes but no but yes. Other agencies didn't get any directives. In some cases, federal judges got this email.\nIt was a really shambolic episode that speaks to, I think, to how arbitrary, capricious, just silly, a lot of DOGE's actions are, and I mean silly in the sense of not thought through, but with very serious implications obviously. In terms of where we landed on it, OPM later said, \"Never mind. You're not going to get fired. Don't worry about it.\" And Elon Musk helpfully tweeted after that, that people would get another chance, but next time, next time, they will be fired. Which again was just a tweet.\nKatie Drummond: And I believe the president himself Monday afternoon said something to the effect of they better respond or they'll be sort of semi-fired or fired. Which again, incredibly unclear, and to be serious for a minute, I mean, it's a ridiculous email. It's a ridiculous situation. But putting myself in the shoes of someone working for the federal government right now, this is their livelihood. This is how they support their family. This is how they get paid.\nImagine getting an email like that, seeing Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, seeing the president himself essentially threaten to terminate your employment at will at any moment if you don't send five bullet points outlining your productivity from the previous week to some email address. It's terrifying and incredibly destabilizing. And again, these are the millions of people who are in theory supposed to be spending their time focused on serving the American people working within these federal agencies. They're instead spending their weekends and their Monday panicking over whether or not to send an email updating Elon Musk on their progress. So obviously that initial deadline has passed. Musk has said second chance. So where does this leave federal workers today?\nBrian Barrett: Well, I think part of the problem is that they were already worried. We're already seeing plans for massive reductions in force across the federal workforce. So I think this was a frustrating incident. I don't think there's relief. I think there is still this sense of dread because there is an ongoing assault on the federal workforce. This would've been a particularly dumb way to lose your job. But I think there is more coming and people know that. So I think everyone is concerned and everybody is scared, and that's just not a productive way to run a business or a government. Government is not business. But if you're going to run it, one, at least do it well.\nAnd one other weird sort of sub note on this that I think is getting a little bit lost is both Elon Musk and Donald Trump said something to the effect that if you don't write back, you probably don't even exist. I think there is a big concern, who knows where it comes from, that Elon Musk and Donald Trump think that there are these phantom federal workers out there and that there are people who don't exist in the payroll. Musk reportedly had the similar concerns when he took over Twitter. I don't know where this comes from. It feels a little bit of a paranoiac view. Who knows if it's sincere, but if that's the basis on which this is being sent, that's alarming. Just in terms of where these guys' heads are at. I think that's sort of something that is really concerning, because it's not just the federal workforce, it's all of the US government and what it does. And if that's the lens through which these people are operating, it's kind of terrifying.\nKatie Drummond: Well, right, and it reminds me too of, I think it was just early last week that Musk repeatedly was commenting on 150-year-old Americans claiming Social Security benefits. And as David Gilbert reported for WIRED, there is no world in which there are sort of just massive numbers of dead people whose Social Security benefits are still being paid out. So it's sort of between the Social Security paranoia and conspiratorial thinking and then sort of speculation about federal employees who don't exist on the payroll. You're right that it certainly calls into question sort of where the head space of the president and Musk is.\nBut I think too, one thing that's interesting to me is that this sort of conspiratorial thinking very much plays into a part of their base. It's the followers of Musk in particular, when I think about sort of X and what we see in terms of people responding to his posts there, they love a conspiracy. So this idea that there is rampant fraud playing out across the country, robbing taxpayers of their dollars going to dead people receiving Social Security benefits, going to fake government employees, it all sort of feeds into this misinformation vortex where Trump and Musk seem to feel very comfortable playing.\nBrian Barrett: At some point, reality is going to sit in. You cannot fire thousands upon thousands of federal workers without there being real world impacts that are tangible, that are more than just a QAnon conspiracy or wherever you pull your information from. And so I think we're starting to see that with people yelling at Republican senators and representatives at town halls when they go home. I think we're going to see more of it when people realize that, oh, the federal government actually does something. It actually did something for me that I didn't recognize. Whether it's farmers who are losing programs under USDA, whether it is people who are hoping for a cure or prevention of diseases, whether it's bird flu.\nKatie Drummond: Oh, don't say bird flu.\nBrian Barrett: Ravaging the country in the next 12 to 18 months. Well, I think we're in such early days of this. So much has happened that it feels like it must have been for a long time. We're like three or four weeks in. The effects are going to be felt 12, 18, 24 months beyond, and I think it's going to be too late to do anything about it.\nKatie Drummond: Thank you for that, Brian. It's all very reassuring.\nBrian Barrett: Let's end right there.\nKatie Drummond: It's all very reassuring.\nBrian Barrett: Stop rolling. That's it.\nKatie Drummond: And we are going to take a short break. When we come back, what you need to read on WIRED.com today.\nWelcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Katie Drummond, WIRED's global editorial director. I'm joined by Brian Barrett, our executive editor. So Brian, before I let you go, and I promise I will, tell our listeners what they absolutely should read on WIRED.com today, other than all of the DOGE coverage that we've talked about in this episode.\nBrian Barrett: You have to read ‚ÄúThe Delirious, Violent, Impossible True Story of the Zizians.‚Äù I'm not going to give too much away because as the headline indicates, it's a ride, but it is about a group of young people in the world of tech who eventually, as the story itself says, fell into an alleged descent into mayhem and death. So read that.\nKatie Drummond: Yeah, read that guys.\nBrian Barrett: On an upbeat note.\nKatie Drummond: It is a fantastic story. Evan Ratliff, one of my long-time, long, long-time favorite writers, so I'm very happy to have him back on WIRED .com with such a fantastic story. I second that recommendation. It is an excellent read. Brian, thank you so much for joining me today.\nBrian Barrett: Thank you, Katie.\nKatie Drummond: All right, that's our show for today.

    "content_text": "When President Donald Trump‚Äôs aides and advisers relay concerns about Elon Musk's takeover of the federal government, they're often given what's intended to be a reassuring answer: Don't worry, Stephen and Katie Miller will take care of it.\nAs Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) task force dismantle key parts of the government and plan to cut the workforce at federal agencies by half or more, the Millers have become pivotal figures in Musk‚Äôs orbit, multiple sources tell WIRED. The couple has been tasked as intermediaries, bringing news about Musk‚Äôs latest targets and communications strategies to the rest of the White House, say members of Trump‚Äôs inner circle and people outside the administration who know them personally. Just over a month into the new administration, they have been privately projecting themselves as two pairs of steady hands at the till.\nStephen Miller is the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser; two sources described his current role as that of a prime minister. His wife, Katie Miller, is a special government employee who functions as the top communications official at DOGE. She is also on the payroll of the firm P2 Public Affairs, The Wall Street Journal reported, which has ties to Musk and several alumni of Florida governor Ron DeSantis‚Äô 2024 presidential campaign.\nStephen was a senior adviser in Trump‚Äôs first term, and an architect of the administration‚Äôs anti-immigration platform, including advocating for the policy of separating migrant children from their families. Katie served in the first Trump administration as deputy press secretary at the Department of Homeland Security during Kirstjen Nielsen‚Äôs tenure before ascending to the role of press secretary in 2019 and communications director in 2020 for then-vice president Mike Pence. The Millers were married in 2020.\nKatie Miller, like many people associated with DOGE, is, as a special government employee, limited to working in the federal government for no more than 130 days in any given 365-day period and subject to less stringent ethics requirements than permanent employees. She was assigned to run communications for Musk prior to the transition, a White House official tells WIRED, beginning her journey with Musk as a ‚Äúcomms sherpa.‚Äù Now she has become the richest man in the world‚Äôs guide to life in Washington and integral to the high-velocity, high-volume barrage of cuts to the government‚Äôs workforce and spending‚Äîmany of them being questioned in the courts as to their legality‚Äîthat have come to dominate Trump‚Äôs first month back in office.\nHer relationship with Musk, the White House official says, is central to DOGE‚Äôs interactions with the rest of the White House. She‚Äôs the key intermediary, delivering the DOGE message of the day to the rest of the administration. She‚Äôs also the one to deliver any sensitive or bad news to Musk, says the official.\nThe Republicans who spoke to WIRED for this story all requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. They are all generally supportive of the DOGE initiatives but share varying degrees of concern about Musk harming Trump‚Äôs image and felt compelled to speak up out of an urge to protect the boss. (Trump, meanwhile, has continued to back Musk publicly with enthusiastic praise for DOGE‚Äôs cuts, most recently with a flattering introduction before Musk held court at Wednesday‚Äôs cabinet meeting.)\nMeanwhile, Stephen Miller has, along with Project 2025 coauthor and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought, became one of Musk‚Äôs closest allies in the administration, The New York Times reported earlier this month. WIRED has learned that the relationship is far closer, and more complicated, than has been previously known publicly.\nIn many ways, Musk‚Äôs targeting of federal agencies is perfectly in sync with the aims of Miller, who has championed DOGE‚Äôs work internally and even helped in making a lot of it possible. (In public, Miller has equated federal workers with ‚Äúradical left Communists‚Äù and ‚Äúcriminal cartels.‚Äù) Still, sources tell WIRED that Trumpworld is more comfortable with Musk taking the heat for the recent federal cuts rather than the less famous‚Äîand, in their view, far less telegenic‚ÄîMiller.\nYet through their actions so far, the Millers and Musk have developed a MAGA version of the Pet Shop Boys adage from the song ‚ÄúOpportunities (Let‚Äôs Make Lots of Money)‚Äù: You‚Äôve got the brawn / I‚Äôve got the brains. Stephen Miller‚Äôs knowledge of the federal apparatus, Katie Miller‚Äôs contacts on Capitol Hill, and the couple‚Äôs good standing among Trump loyalists, coupled with Musk‚Äôs relentless ambition and effectively infinite resources, made the scale of the DOGE government takeover possible.

    "content_text": "As part of a new $1 billion plan to address bird flu in poultry and lower egg prices across the country, US secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins announced Wednesday that the Department of Agriculture is considering vaccinating chickens against highly pathogenic avian influenza.\nThe US has dealt with flare-ups of bird flu in the past, but the current outbreak has been raging since 2022. The virus has been detected in wild birds in every state, which go on to expose commercial poultry and other animals. At least 166 million birds and 973 dairy herds have been affected in the current US outbreak. Infected animals have led to 70 cases of bird flu in people, including one death.\nBird flu is extremely deadly for poultry and can wipe out flocks quickly. To stop the virus from spreading, the USDA has long promoted culling infected birds. The practice has led to a 53 percent increase in egg prices from January 2024 to January of this year, and this week the USDA predicted an additional 40 percent increase in 2025.\nIn a Wall Street Journal editorial published Wednesday morning, Rollins said the USDA is ‚Äúexploring the use of vaccines and therapeutics for laying chickens,‚Äù which should help reduce the need to depopulate flocks. She added that, ‚ÄúWhile vaccines aren‚Äôt a stand-alone solution, we will provide up to $100 million in research and development of vaccines and therapeutics, to improve their efficacy and efficiency.‚Äù\nIn addition to the $100 million the USDA is spending on vaccine research, the agency is committing $500 million for biosecurity measures on farms and $400 million in financial relief for affected farmers. It‚Äôs also exploring temporary import options and considering ways to increase the domestic supply of eggs.\nEarlier this month, the USDA issued a conditional license to animal health company Zoetis for an updated bird flu vaccine for use in chickens. The conditional license was granted on the demonstration of safety, purity, and reasonable expectation of efficacy based on antibody responses in vaccinated chickens. Previous avian influenza outbreaks prompted the US to stockpile vaccines, but those shots are based on older strains of the virus and have never been used in poultry. One of those older vaccines, made by Zoetis and conditionally approved in 2016, was first used in 2023 by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to help protect California condors.\nChickens already receive several vaccinations for common diseases, and some countries are already vaccinating against bird flu, but the US has held out over concerns that immunization could hurt the exported poultry market.\n‚ÄúMany times vaccines are not completely effective against a viral challenge,‚Äù says Gino Lorenzoni, associate professor of poultry science and avian health at Penn State University. ‚ÄúThe disease is probably not going to be fatal in many [vaccinated] animals, but the virus may still be reproducing and circulating within a population.‚Äù\nThe worry therefore is that if vaccination does not provide full protection, the virus could go undetected in poultry exports. Countries that buy poultry from the US could then impose trade restrictions because of the possibility of receiving infected products. When France decided to vaccinate ducks against bird flu in October 2023, the US and Canada banned certain French poultry imports. Those bans were partially lifted in January, after the French government was able to ensure safe trade.\nIn the US, poultry vaccination would likely focus on egg-laying chickens, as opposed to broiler chickens, which are raised for meat. During the current outbreak, more than 77 percent of the domestic poultry affected have been commercial egg-laying hens. In a USDA press release, Rollins said the agency is considering a ‚Äútargeted and thoughtful strategy‚Äù for vaccination.\nBut the broiler chicken industry worries that even targeted vaccination of laying chickens would hurt the US, which is the second-largest exporter of poultry meat. Ashley Peterson, senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the National Chicken Council, says other countries are likely to ban all US poultry products, even if the US only vaccinates laying chickens. ‚ÄúWhen you move to a vaccine, you are essentially saying the virus is endemic and this is how we‚Äôre going to cope with it,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe would prefer to not cope with the virus. We would prefer to eliminate it completely.‚Äù\nThe organization supports the USDA‚Äôs current policy of culling infected flocks, as well as increasing biosecurity on farms‚Äîmeasures such as quarantining newly acquired animals, wearing protective clothing in poultry houses, disinfecting footwear before entering animal areas, and cleaning farm equipment.\nBut Carol Cardona, a professor of avian health at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine, says biosecurity alone is unlikely to eliminate bird flu. ‚ÄúFarmers are so fatigued from hearing about biosecurity because they‚Äôre doing everything they can already,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWithout more information about how those birds are getting infected, it‚Äôs very difficult to target biosecurity correctly.‚Äù\nThe virus can be carried in and out of poultry barns on shoes, clothes, and equipment that moves in and out of poultry barns. Mice, rats, and other small mammals can also carry the virus.\nWith the disease now so widespread, Cardona says, it will take more than one strategy to reduce outbreaks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been fighting this fight with one hand tied behind our back, and I think there are other tools,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe have to create new methods to keep it out, and part of that is going to involve that vaccination.‚Äù\nEven if vaccination doesn‚Äôt always prevent infection, Lorenzoni says it would still help reduce the amount of virus that‚Äôs circulating in the environment, which would slow down the spread of the disease to more farms.\nAnd trade disruption could be brief. Rollins said the USDA will work with trading partners to limit impacts to export trade markets from potential vaccination. Lorenzoni says there will be pressure from other markets to keep the international exchange of poultry viable. ‚ÄúIt is in everyone‚Äôs best interest to move as fast as they can with these commercial agreements,‚Äù he says.",

    "content_text": "At a Trump administration cabinet meeting on Wednesday, unelected South African centibillionaire Elon Musk joked about how his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) ‚Äúaccidentally canceled‚Äù Ebola prevention. He assured the room that DOGE had ‚Äúfixed‚Äù the issue. In reality, as an Ebola outbreak continues in Uganda, the aid response from the United States has been severely curtailed by the destruction of the country‚Äôs largest foreign aid arm‚Äîand other lifesaving humanitarian programs are also still broken, including AIDS and famine work.\nOver the past month, DOGE has overseen the dismantling of USAID, first placing on administrative leave and then laying off the vast majority of its workers, and freezing funding for contractors implementing its programs. The State Department developed emergency humanitarian waivers intended to keep lifesaving work going‚Äîbut current and former USAID workers and other public health experts have told WIRED that the waivers are useless.\n‚ÄúThe waiver is a myth‚Äù says Asia Russell, the executive director of the international HIV advocacy group Health GAP.\nCurrent and former USAID workers and other Ebola experts do not believe these issues are corrected, with Ebola-response teams having been dismantled and payments to partner organizations delayed, as first reported by The Washington Post. ‚ÄúThe entire Global Health team has been gutted,‚Äù one current worker (who spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retribution) tells WIRED. ‚ÄúSo the response would be minimal.‚Äù\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head up Ebola prevention within the US, with USAID supporting efforts abroad. On January 27, the CDC was ordered to cease communications with the World Health Organization, the United Nations agency devoted to responding to public health crises.\n\"CDC was given an exemption to coordinate with WHO and other external partners to conduct public health outbreak and emergency response,\" CDC spokesperson Melissa Dibble told WIRED in response to questions about how the Ebola outbreak was impacted by the Trump administration changes. It is unclear when the exemption was granted.\nCraig Spencer, a public health professor at Brown University and epidemiologist who survived Ebola after contracting it treating patients in Guinea in 2014, says Musk‚Äôs claims about fixing the issue are wrong. He points to the stark difference between the US response to a Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda last year and the current outbreak in Uganda as evidence that things have stopped working properly. The US responded promptly to the Marburg eruption, he says, and helped contain the disease‚Äôs spread; this time around, Spencer says, Ugandan health workers struggled to get in touch with the CDC in a timely manner. While the WHO was able to step in, Spencer worries about future incidents without robust US global public health funding and infrastructure: ‚ÄúOutbreaks will be worse on the ground, and get bigger quicker.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe US funding freeze has affected key outbreak response capacities,‚Äù says World Health Organization spokesperson Alexander Nyka. The absence of USAID‚Äôs Outbreak Response Team is especially keenly felt; WHO describes its services as a ‚Äúgame changer.‚Äù According to WHO, the US previously provided around 20 to 40 percent of funding for sudden infectious disease outbreaks.\n‚ÄúUganda‚Äôs Ebola outbreak occurred on the same day as the foreign aid freeze. Despite that, the waiver for assistance in addressing the outbreak was quickly reinstated,‚Äù the State Department told WIRED in a statement. ‚ÄúThis is a process. If errors are made, they will be flagged and corrected as needed, while striving to do what‚Äôs best for the American people.‚Äù\nOther lifesaving USAID programs ostensibly granted humanitarian waivers have encountered similar issues. Earlier this month, WIRED reported that the food aid and famine prevention program FEWS NET remains inactive, despite having received a waiver, with many of the workers who had implemented the program furloughed or laid off. This is still true today. ‚ÄúWe have not yet been able to resume any activities,‚Äù says Payal Chandiramani, a spokesperson for Chemonics, the international firm implementing a large portion of the program.\nMeanwhile, lifesaving AIDS and HIV programs are also not resumed. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is one of USAID‚Äôs most high-profile success stories, credited with saving over 26 million lives since former President George W. Bush founded the program in 2003. Around the same time Musk was joking about his USAID blunders with Trump officials, PEPFAR‚Äôs supporters gathered for a protest in Washington, DC, to draw attention to the impact of losing these programs. Despite receiving a waiver, PEPFAR has not been able to resume its work, along with other stymied AIDS-related programs, with funding and staffing cuts hampering the program. ‚ÄúThe waivers have not been working,‚Äù says Emory Babcock, a former USAID contractor working on PEPFAR laid off at the beginning of DOGE‚Äôs cuts.\nOn the same day as Musk‚Äôs comments, the Trump administration terminated over 10,000 global health grants from USAID and the State Department, killing a variety of services that had been granted a lifesaving waiver.\nThe Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, a nonprofit that often receives funding from USAID and works with PEPFAR, got notice on Wednesday that three of its project agreements with USAID had been terminated, despite previously receiving approval to resume activities under the PEPFAR waiver. The programs support over 350,000 patients in Lesotho, Eswatini, and Tanzania, including 10,000 children. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing left,‚Äù says Russell. ‚ÄúThe collateral damage is piles of bodies.‚Äù\nEven though a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to unfreeze foreign aid funds to temporarily fulfill outstanding bills and payments owed to contractors around the world, the Supreme Court stayed the order on Wednesday night, which means aid groups‚Äîincluding those working on infectious disease prevention in Africa‚Äîcontinue to go unpaid for services rendered, in some cases preventing any further lifesaving work.\nMeanwhile, a new, deadly hemorrhagic fever has emerged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo over the past five weeks, with over 60 people already dead, and the number of people falling sick still rising. Although it causes a violent, rapid cascade of symptoms, including vomiting blood, it is not Ebola, nor Marburg, but instead appears to be an unknown disease. A USAID worker who spoke on the condition of anonymity tells WIRED: ‚ÄúWe have nobody on the ground to monitor this.‚Äù\nUpdate 2/27/25 6:21 ET: This story has been updated with comment from the CDC.",

    "content_text": "GPT-4.5 is here, and OpenAI‚Äôs newest generative AI model is bigger and more compute-intensive than ever‚Äîit‚Äôs supposedly also better at understanding what ChatGPT users mean with their prompts. Users who want to be part of the first wave to try GPT-4.5, labeled as a research preview, will be required to pay for OpenAI‚Äôs $200-a-month ChatGPT Pro subscription.\nPrior to this launch, 2025 has already been filled with new AI model releases. Anthropic recently put out a hybrid reasoning model for its Claude chatbot. Before that, Chinese researchers at DeepSeek rocked Silicon Valley with their release of a powerful model trained on a tiny budget, prompting OpenAI to drop a ‚Äúmini‚Äù version of its reasoning model a month ago.\nAlongside these new releases, OpenAI promised to invest billions into building the AI infrastructure required to fuel more massive models. And GPT-4.5 is a reiteration of this current strategy from the startup: Bigger is better.\nChatGPT 4.5 is in stark contrast to other recent AI innovations, like DeepSeek‚Äôs R1, that attempted to match the performance of a frontier model with as few resources as possible. OpenAI still sees a strong path forward through scaling its models. According to researchers who worked on GPT-4.5, this kind of maximalist mindset to model development has captured more of the nuances of human emotions and interactions.\nThey see the model‚Äôs size as also potentially helping this iteration hallucinate with less frequency than past releases. ‚ÄúIf you know more things, you don't need to make things up,‚Äù says Mia Glaese, who leads OpenAI‚Äôs alignment team and human data team. Exactly how big or compute-intensive GPT-4.5 is remains unclear‚ÄîOpenAI declined to share specific numbers.\nSo, what‚Äôs it like to use the new model? Pro users are getting a first look, with rollouts for Plus and Team users scheduled for next week and Enterprise and Edu the week afterwards. GPT-4.5 supports the web search and canvas feature as well as uploads of files and images, though it‚Äôs not yet compatible with the AI Voice Mode.\nIn the announcement post for GPT-4.5, OpenAI included academic benchmark results that show the model getting vastly outpaced by the o3-mini model when it comes to math, and slightly upstaged on science as well, though GPT-4.5 did score a little higher on language benchmarks. The researchers say these measurements don‚Äôt capture the full story. ‚ÄúWe would expect the difference in 4.5 to be similar to the experience difference of 4 to 3.5,‚Äù says Glaese. For the user, prompts related to subjects like writing or programming may yield stronger results, with the back-and-forth interactions feeling more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù overall. She hopes all of the chats from this limited release will help them to better understand what GPT-4.5 excels at, as well as its limitations.\nUnlike those released as part of OpenAI‚Äôs ‚Äúo‚Äù series, GPT-4.5 is not considered to be a reasoning model. The company‚Äôs CEO, Sam Altman, posted on social media earlier in February that OpenAI would ‚Äúship GPT-4.5, the model we called Orion internally, as our last non-chain-of-thought model.‚Äù Nick Ryder, who leads the company‚Äôs foundations-in-research team, clarified that this statement pertained to streamlining OpenAI‚Äôs product road map, not its research road map. The startup is not just looking into reasoning models, but users can expect to see a more blended experience overall with future releases for ChatGPT where you don't have to pick which one to use.\n‚ÄúSaying this is the last non-reasoning model really means we're really striving to be in a future where all users are getting routed to the right model,‚Äù says Ryder. After the user logs in to ChatGPT, the AI tool should be able to gauge which model to utilize in response to their prompts. While first designed as a way to easily switch between the different available options, the dropdown model menu in ChatGPT has become difficult to parse for users trying to understand when it's advantageous to choose o3-mini-high rather than GPT-4o or some other pick.\nIn the face of increasing pressure from competition, OpenAI desires to still be seen as on the cutting edge of the technology and is investing in pretraining as part of that strategy. ‚ÄúBy increasing the amount of compute we use, by increasing the amount of data we use, and focusing on really efficient training methods,‚Äù says Ryder, ‚Äúwe push the frontier of unsupervised learning.‚Äù\nDue to GPT-4.5‚Äôs massive alleged size, does it become even harder to parse what‚Äôs going on inside of the model? Ryder doesn't think system interpretability, the attempt to understand why a model generates specific outputs, will be harder due to scaling. Actually, he sees the same methods used for smaller models directly applying to these more massive endeavors.\nAs part of WIRED‚Äôs ongoing coverage of new software releases, I‚Äôll be testing GPT-4.5 to see firsthand how it compares to the competition and past releases. It may be difficult to compare it to other versions due to OpenAI‚Äôs characterization of GPT-4.5‚Äôs potential strengths, like a stronger intuition, better emotional intelligence, and aesthetic taste, leaning into an almost abstract sense of anthropomorphism. Sure, the company wants to eventually build an AI capable of matching the labor output of a remote worker‚Äîand now it‚Äôs hoping to nail the soft skills as well.",

Subscribe Today.\nHow to Layer\nWe have a full guide on how to layer, but here are your essentials.\nBase layer: A good set of thermals is essential in the fight against cold, especially when you‚Äôre working hard. The best fabrics wick away sweat as you heat up, which helps regulate your temperature. Merino wool is the best at this, but also the most expensive. Synthetic fabrics are getting better, though, and please avoid cotton at all costs, as it gets wet and stays that way, making you cold and uncomfortable.\nMid layer: Whether you choose a hooded fleece or puffer-style jacket, this layer does the bulk of the work in cold conditions. Combined with the base layer, it traps warm air in, while also allowing moisture to be expelled. Synthetic insulation such as Primaloft Gold is brilliant and doesn‚Äôt lose its properties if it gets wet. Down jackets offer the best warmth-to-weight ratio, but they don‚Äôt pack down as small, and should never get wet. A fleece with an insulated vest is a great option if you really feel the cold.\nJacket: While ski jackets with insulation offer bonus warmth in Arctic-like conditions, for most people a waterproof shell will be enough, as it offers protection from both the snow and the wind. A cold wind will chill you to your bones faster than a bit of wet snow. Ideally choose a jacket with a waterproof membrane such as Gore-Tex (make sure it is free from PFAS, or forever chemicals), but also check for taped seams for added waterproofing, plus plenty of pockets for snacks and lift passes, and wrist cuffs and ski skirts to help keep out the snow.\nSocks: As with your base layer, socks keep you warm and maintain your temperature when you‚Äôre building up a sweat. Natural fabrics work well, but a blend of merino wool with synthetic stretchy fibers is the way to go, as they stay up better and can be used for more than a day. Avoid cotton again, and never wear two pairs, as you‚Äôll almost certainly get colder feet.\nGloves: You‚Äôll be surprised by how wet ski gloves get when it‚Äôs snowing, even if you don‚Äôt fall very often. As a result, waterproof options work best in most cases, although well-made leather designs can be almost as waterproof as a pair with Gore-Tex. Mittens are generally warmer than gloves, but what you gain in toasty fingers you lose in dexterity. Check out our Best Ski Gloves and Mittens guide for more information.\nWaterproofing and breathability ratings: Waterproofing is measured with a hydrostatic head rating, or HH. That means if you put a 1-inch, endlessly long square tube on top of the fabric, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water before it would seep through. Breathability is rated in how many grams of vapor per square meter can can pass through the fabric in 24 hours.\nHow We Tested\nI've been reviewing winter sports gear for more than 15 years. In that time, I have worn an untold number of jackets, pants, mid-layers, thermals, gloves, and mittens. I called on industry experts and professional skiers, and solicited opinions from fellow winter sport enthusiasts on the WIRED team. While a basic fit check can be done in the office, nothing replaces on-mountain testing in variable conditions. We put in the time on various trips to the French Alps, as well as in resorts in Vermont, Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon.\nHonorable Mentions\nDuring the winter, a whole WIRED crew tests ski clothes almost constantly. Here are a few other items that we like.\nHestra Fall Line 3-Finger Gloves for $165: I've long admired Hestra gloves from across the lift line, impressed by the Swedish company's elegant stitchwork and thoughtful design touches. This was the year I finally got to try a pair for myself, and the Fall Line are exactly what they look like. There are six sizes available so you can get the perfect fit in this glove. The cowhide is buttery smooth and has already broken in a bit with five days' use. The wrist strap means you never have to fret about dropping your glove from the lift when checking your phone, and they're very warm without making me sweat. If you do sweat, the lining is removable so you can wash it without damaging the leather. ‚ÄîMartin Cizmar\nOutdoor Research Snowcrew Pants for $229: These Outdoor Research ski pants have every feature you could want (mesh gaiters, zippered pockets, thigh vents) and none you don't need. They're made from a fabric called Ventia that's soft to the touch while also being breathable and relatively waterproof, and while the fit is baggy, they have tabs to adjust the waist so you're not actually reliving the Limp Bizkit era of snow sports unless you choose to. The khaki-adjacent bronze color compliments nearly any color of top. I didn't think about these pants at all during two days on the slopes, which is exactly the experience I want from my ski pants. ‚ÄîMartin Cizmar\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket for $498 and Bib for $398: Seniq is another all-women‚Äôs outdoor brand that launched in 2024. It's styled a little more Gen Z, leaning into fun color blocking over the monochromatic look. The Seniq Powder Puff Down Jacket has a dry-touch finish. It‚Äôs meant for drier days on the mountain, but a PFC-free DWR coating and YKK AquaGuard zippers do provide water resistance. The asymmetric front zipper helps you avoid chin rub when you have the jacket fully zipped. It also features cool asymmetrical quilting lines, side pockets-in-pockets that provide access to your bib (their bibs have a pocket on the front, so you can get in there without unzipping your jacket), an oversized removable hood, a forearm pass pocket, soft and stretchy wrist gaiters, and a large internal pocket that can absolutely handle a sandwich. This jacket was warm, pillowy, and comforting, like a super-soft hug.\nThe silky shell bibs are slightly barrel cut, which gives them a flattering shape without being fitted. The adjustable racer back-style straps and low back (with a stretchy waist) also provide a nice shape and breathability. There are two pockets on the front chest, pockets on either leg, two-way zip thigh vents, and a butt zipper for bathroom breaks. These fit easily over my boots, and the instep guards were a nice touch. With a durable three-layer membrane and a 20,000-mm waterproof rating, these will hold up against any and all weather the mountain throws at you. When I wore them on a wet snowy day, they beaded and sloughed off moisture well. ‚ÄîKristin Canning\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket for $260: This puffy hoodie is a great mid-layer for under a shell jacket. The insulation is made from recycled rope scraps, and the outer is coated in wind-resistant PFC-free DWR coating. The hem falls at the hips, and the high collar and tight hood keep most of the face covered. I like wearing this piece under shells for snowboarding, but I know it‚Äôll pull double duty as a comfy hiking and camping jacket, too, so it‚Äôs a solid multipurpose investment. It‚Äôs exceptionally lightweight and warm, though from a volume standpoint, it is on the bulkier side for a mid-layer and isn‚Äôt the most packable piece. ‚ÄîKristin Canning\nHelly Hansen Evolved Air Half Zip for $112: This fleece pullover has a waffle-like texture that traps heat and wicks moisture. With a high zippered collar and cinchable hem, you can adjust the fit to make it more air-tight or breathable. This mid-layer felt wonderfully lightweight while still keeping my toasty. It‚Äôs not bulky at all, only a little thicker than a base layer, laid comfortably under my jackets, and moved with me on the mountain. ‚ÄîKristin Canning\nHelly Hansen Lifa Base Layer Long-Sleeve Crew for $88 and Pants for $88: These base layers hit the weight sweet spot; they‚Äôre not too thick or thin, but just right. They‚Äôre slightly looser than other options on this list, so if you prefer something that isn‚Äôt so fitted, these are a great pick (but note that they run long too). These combine merino wool with Helly Hansen‚Äôs LIFA fibers, which add more moisture-wicking capabilities. They‚Äôre soft, lightweight, warm, and don‚Äôt hold onto smells. I love the cute designs and how well they regulate my temperature under insulated jackets and pants. The waist digs in a bit but doesn‚Äôt roll, and they stay in place and move well. ‚ÄîKristin Canning",

When I wore them on a wet snowy day, they beaded and sloughed off moisture well. <em>‚ÄîKristin Canning</em></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>Mammut Sender In Hooded Jacket</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Canning</span></div></figure><p><strong><a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6exhfamEeE8bkUyUzd1bW5vQN2U7Lwc6nwYmBqAjfe2yM9xKFeytwMN423RrcUR4y5xyBV21xJcJrvBpK53hDA19HXw9s1qsUbXUyHgM1k1395LFFu32qPfr4QQ8XjGnomx3SjBLNnQhodD7XBtavdNwE6wpg4iMTRgWRTmjg9ViJNfBPnmaBZLJ2pVvL6za6a22NUb4KureLZwYzwT8vguUmbgFzsAYWY9M22wbTC1mSyWsXj4WDHthZLtRwSEzLFkMRMw4NsnXJVR2ixU9uuTHLjoaoC8rxVxfL91ZMt1G7TC8Mz6mYgfuLsQMp\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.mammut.com/us/en/products/1013-03480-5118/sender-in-hooded-jacket-women\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6exhfamEeE8bkUyUzd1bW5vQN2U7Lwc6nwYmBqAjfe2yM9xKFeytwMN423RrcUR4y5xyBV21xJcJrvBpK53hDA19HXw9s1qsUbXUyHgM1k1395LFFu32qPfr4QQ8XjGnomx3SjBLNnQhodD7XBtavdNwE6wpg4iMTRgWRTmjg9ViJNfBPnmaBZLJ2pVvL6za6a22NUb4KureLZwYzwT8vguUmbgFzsAYWY9M22wbTC1mSyWsXj4WDHthZLtRwSEzLFkMRMw4NsnXJVR2ixU9uuTHLjoaoC8rxVxfL91ZMt1G7TC8Mz6mYgfuLsQMp\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Mammut Sender In Hooded Jacket for $260</a>:</strong> This puffy hoodie is a great mid-layer for under a shell jacket. The insulation is made from recycled rope scraps, and the outer is coated in wind-resistant PFC-free DWR coating. The hem falls at the hips, and the high collar and tight hood keep most of the face covered. I like wearing this piece under shells for snowboarding, but I know it‚Äôll pull double duty as a comfy hiking and camping jacket, too, so it‚Äôs a solid multipurpose investment. It‚Äôs exceptionally lightweight and warm, though from a volume standpoint, it is on the bulkier side for a mid-layer and isn‚Äôt the most packable piece. <em>‚ÄîKristin Canning</em></p><ad position=\"mid-content\"></ad><p><strong><a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2jeUyzVq98BcF5JtPUN4eCqpTcJAarE2AFxwCi1T18xEbaFSs7pDYG4iG1DutR3U734EfSupVk4TwtKE8ahBb71eMVeLCAKchmfmkHuHtLF1Kq4ms6W3gcEFFcoxWPkMBHtF7MYAKNcQ8Mw4QSD2ZbgdTxHRbJC4ekNCT8sgyhE6adRuuNNERSBc5n5AH5ovH1mav2UCAkXXciVdTpvWUajeFdPNmdbpGbyztKpXgCm87ZqSRGcjQUkK4fWKxBf9KWhcUA5s6BTxjrUNFb26WWEpnan9cWAGuBns1R4eabq2PRAVQ\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.hellyhansen.com/en_us/w-evolved-air-1-2-zip-49555?color=631698\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2jeUyzVq98BcF5JtPUN4eCqpTcJAarE2AFxwCi1T18xEbaFSs7pDYG4iG1DutR3U734EfSupVk4TwtKE8ahBb71eMVeLCAKchmfmkHuHtLF1Kq4ms6W3gcEFFcoxWPkMBHtF7MYAKNcQ8Mw4QSD2ZbgdTxHRbJC4ekNCT8sgyhE6adRuuNNERSBc5n5AH5ovH1mav2UCAkXXciVdTpvWUajeFdPNmdbpGbyztKpXgCm87ZqSRGcjQUkK4fWKxBf9KWhcUA5s6BTxjrUNFb26WWEpnan9cWAGuBns1R4eabq2PRAVQ\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Helly Hansen Evolved Air Half Zip for $112</a>:</strong> This fleece pullover has a waffle-like texture that traps heat and wicks moisture. With a high zippered collar and cinchable hem, you can adjust the fit to make it more air-tight or breathable. This mid-layer felt wonderfully lightweight while still keeping my toasty. It‚Äôs not bulky at all, only a little thicker than a base layer, laid comfortably under my jackets, and moved with me on the mountain. <em>‚ÄîKristin Canning</em></p><p><strong>Helly Hansen Lifa Base Layer <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6exhfamEeE8bkUyUzd1bW5vQN2U7Lwc6nwYmBqAjfe2yM9xKFeytwMN423RrcUR4xpMiqLjKefCwECusaxpmkhR5inhusyR2gNcy4pUduLRAA88XsfhWkeUSgNAcrGcgfGnEK4fm9qeaKd2cSbcy2AwHg3RD2agTZGRgc3rcBeh2LPhcu2xHjm35XJXwVoxKTqPCkKeDqS5oF5yZpY6kVVvo1gUxpf94W4jA9nxmnD9QV2UMnxyzVKGkpjFYfjVukCav4Mfy1gfqkEJRiQZsqyEjHCd9FLmDeBZZgg2Rufus4FpVH2mwgoYdxamsQ\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.hellyhansen.com/en_us/w-lifa-merino-midweight-graphi-49379?color=627688\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6exhfamEeE8bkUyUzd1bW5vQN2U7Lwc6nwYmBqAjfe2yM9xKFeytwMN423RrcUR4xpMiqLjKefCwECusaxpmkhR5inhusyR2gNcy4pUduLRAA88XsfhWkeUSgNAcrGcgfGnEK4fm9qeaKd2cSbcy2AwHg3RD2agTZGRgc3rcBeh2LPhcu2xHjm35XJXwVoxKTqPCkKeDqS5oF5yZpY6kVVvo1gUxpf94W4jA9nxmnD9QV2UMnxyzVKGkpjFYfjVukCav4Mfy1gfqkEJRiQZsqyEjHCd9FLmDeBZZgg2Rufus4FpVH2mwgoYdxamsQ\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Long-Sleeve Crew for $88</a> and <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6exhfamEeE8bkUyUzd1bW5vQN2U7Lwc6nwYmBqAjfe2yM9xKFeytwMN423RrcUR4xpMiqLjKefCwECusaxpmkhR5inhusyR2gNcy4pUduLRAA88XsfhWkeUSgNAcrGcgfGnEK4fm9qeaMZvwSf3WcKJtLw5C3xGLqjW3KxeaMhWcbgz9fsbpcWWUd7PBTLBSjqD6kLYF7faHXpMFbpwajVcXLGyPbBvW1FoW62UCJdHE6zQmzmfqxPi2W1Q27NTLTpwpZXVfxqSDEPezr1SivuKbiZiNGewbuJtuoeVrYeb8DqJCT1FEqjENzUMir\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.hellyhansen.com/en_us/w-lifa-merino-midweight-graphi-49411?color=627688\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/6exhfamEeE8bkUyUzd1bW5vQN2U7Lwc6nwYmBqAjfe2yM9xKFeytwMN423RrcUR4xpMiqLjKefCwECusaxpmkhR5inhusyR2gNcy4pUduLRAA88XsfhWkeUSgNAcrGcgfGnEK4fm9qeaMZvwSf3WcKJtLw5C3xGLqjW3KxeaMhWcbgz9fsbpcWWUd7PBTLBSjqD6kLYF7faHXpMFbpwajVcXLGyPbBvW1FoW62UCJdHE6zQmzmfqxPi2W1Q27NTLTpwpZXVfxqSDEPezr1SivuKbiZiNGewbuJtuoeVrYeb8DqJCT1FEqjENzUMir\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Pants for $88</a>:</strong> These base layers hit the weight sweet spot; they‚Äôre not too thick or thin, but just right. They‚Äôre slightly looser than other options on this list, so if you prefer something that isn‚Äôt so fitted, these are a great pick (but note that they run long too). These combine merino wool with Helly Hansen‚Äôs LIFA fibers, which add more moisture-wicking capabilities. They‚Äôre soft, lightweight, warm, and don‚Äôt hold onto smells. I love the cute designs and how well they regulate my temperature under insulated jackets and pants. The waist digs in a bit but doesn‚Äôt roll, and they stay in place and move well. <em>‚ÄîKristin Canning</em></p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "If you‚Äôve felt overwhelmed by all the DOGE news, you‚Äôre not alone. You‚Äôd need too much cork board and yarn to keep track of which agencies it has occupied by now, much less what it‚Äôs doing there. Here‚Äôs a simple rubric, though, to help contextualize the DOGE updates you do have time and energy to process: It‚Äôs worse than you think.\nDOGE is hard to keep track of. This is by design; the only information about the group outside of its own mistake-ridden ledger of ‚Äúsavings‚Äù comes from media reports. So much for being ‚Äúmaximally transparent,‚Äù as Elon Musk has promised. The blurriness is also partly a function of the speed and breadth with which DOGE has operated. Keeping track of the destruction is like counting individual bricks scattered around a demolition site.\nYou may be aware, for instance, that a 19-year-old who goes by ‚ÄúBig Balls‚Äù online plays some role in all this. Seems bad. But you may have missed that Edward Coristine has since been installed at the nation‚Äôs top cybersecurity agency. And the State Department and the Small Business Administration. And he has a Department of Homeland Security email address and, by the way, also had a recent side gig selling AI Discord bots to Russians. See? Worse than you think.\nEven if that feels like old news, remember that it‚Äôs actually still happening, every day a fresh incursion by Big Balls and his cohort of twentysomething technologists. (In fairness, they‚Äôre not all young; some of them are old enough to present conflicts of interest so flagrant that they literally lack modern precedent.)\nSimilarly, you‚Äôve likely heard that the United States Agency for International Development has been gutted and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been put on ice. All true, all bad. But here‚Äôs what that means in practice: Fewer people globally have access to vaccines than they did a month ago. More babies are being born with HIV/AIDS. From here on out, anyone who gets ripped off by payday loan companies‚Äîor, say, social media platforms moonlighting as payments services‚Äîhas lost their most capable defender.\nKeep going. The thousands of so-called probationary employees DOGE has fired included a significant number of experienced workers who had just been promoted or transferred. National Science Foundation staffing cuts and proposed National Institutes of Health grant limits will combine to kneecap scientific research in the United States for a generation. Terminations at the US Department of Agriculture have sent programs designed to help farmers into disarray. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration canceled a meeting that would have given guidance on this year‚Äôs flu vaccine composition. It hasn‚Äôt been rescheduled.\nDon‚Äôt care about science or vaccines? The Social Security Administration is reportedly going to cut its staff in half. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is going to be cut by as much as 84 percent. Hundreds of workers who keep the power grid humming in the Pacific Northwest were fired before a scramble to rehire a few of them. The National Parks Service, the Internal Revenue Service, all hit hard. So don‚Äôt make any long-term bets on getting your checks on time, keeping your lights on, buying a home for the first time, or enjoying Yosemite. Don‚Äôt assume all the things that work now will still work tomorrow.\nSpeaking of which, let‚Äôs not forget that DOGE has fired people working to prevent bird flu and to safeguard the US nuclear arsenal. (The problem with throwing a chainsaw around is that you don‚Äôt make clean cuts.) The agencies in question have reportedly tried to hire those workers back. Fine. But even if they‚Äôre able to, the long-term question that hasn‚Äôt been answered yet is, Who would stay? Who would work under a regime so cocksure and incompetent that it would mistakenly fire the only handful of people who actually know how to take care of the nukes? According to a recent report from The Bulwark, that brain drain is already underway.\nAnd this is all before the real reductions in force begin, mass purges of civil servants that will soon be conducted, it seems, with an assist from DOGE-modified, automated software. The US government is about to lose decades of institutional knowledge across who knows how many agencies, including specialists that aren‚Äôt readily replaced by loyalists.\nElon Musk has, at least, acknowledged that DOGE will make mistakes, and promised fast fixes. He even called one out specifically Wednesday, the cancelation of a USAID program designed to prevent the spread of Ebola. ‚ÄúWe restored the Ebola prevention immediately,‚Äù he said during an appearance at Trump‚Äôs first cabinet meeting. ‚ÄúAnd there was no interruption.‚Äù\nThis is not the case, as The Washington Post first reported. Not only has Ebola prevention not been restored‚Äîit was and remains severely diminished‚Äîbut the Trump administration also said Wednesday it would terminate nearly 10,000 contracts and grants from USAID and the State Department. Many of those contracts represent an attempt to lessen some form of suffering in some part of the world. It‚Äôs too many individual stories to tell, too many tragedies unfolding too far away.\nIt‚Äôs worse than you think in the same way that your brain breaks a little when you try to picture how deep the ocean is. It‚Äôs worse than you think because by the time the courts catch up the damage will already have been done. It‚Äôs worse than you think because the people running the government seem to have no higher mission than to watch it burn.\nFederal agencies could absolutely be more efficient, but we‚Äôre long past the point where efficiency is a plausible goal. DOGE‚Äôs cuts have no apparent regard for civil society or opportunity costs or long-term strategic thinking. Their targets are Elon Musk‚Äôs and Project 2025‚Äôs targets. They have found no fraud, just democracy at work. They‚Äôre apparently eager to see what happens when it no longer does.\nIt‚Äôs worse than you think because so far all DOGE has done is drop a boulder into the middle of a pond. If you think this is bad, wait for the ripples.\nThe Chatroom\nWhat will be the most lasting impact of the DOGE cuts?\nLeave a comment on the site or send your thoughts to mail@wired.com.\nWIRED Reads\n- DOGE Is Working on Software That Automates the Firing of Federal Workers: Operatives working for Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE appear to be editing the code of AutoRIF‚Äîsoftware designed by the Defense Department that could assist in mass firings of federal workers, sources tell WIRED.\n- DOGE Staffers at HUD Are From an AI Real Estate Firm and a Mobile Home Operator: Elon Musk‚Äôs men at HUD come from the real estate sector.

    "content_text": "Kia is coming after Volkswagen's foothold on the electric camper market with the new Light Camper, built on its newly announced PV5 electric van.\nHoping to rival the much-admired ID.Buzz, the Light Camper looks to be the production version of the WKNDR concept from November last year‚Äîand Kia's boss also confirmed a larger all-electric camper is being considered too.\n‚ÄúYes, we are interested in providing a camper van‚Äînot only the Light Camper based on PV5, but also one based on PV7, too,‚Äù said Kia president Ho-Sung Song this week at the Korean company's brand-hosted annual EV reveal day in Tarragona, Spain.\nBuilt on the new E-GMP.S platform, the mid-sized PV5 van will launch with Passenger and Cargo variations in Korea and Europe in the second half of this year, starting at a price of around ¬£29,000 ($37,000). As well as the Light Camper, other versions including a Chassis Cab, Crew Cab, Freezer Box, Drop Side, and WAV (Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle) will follow.\nYou'll be able to choose from either a 51.5-kWh or 71.2-kWh battery, with the more powerful version promising a max range just shy of 250 miles (30 miles or so less than the Volkswagen ID.Buzz). Kia says a 10 to 80 percent charge will take just 30 minutes with the right charger.\nAt the reveal, Kia wanted to focus on the Cargo (with up to 5.1 m3 space in the back) and Passenger options, and was reluctant to talk about the coming campers, but the above image of the interior of the Light Camper was ever-so-briefly flashed up on a giant screen during the presentation. What's more, a side exhibit at the event displayed a PV5 rear end with various camping paraphernalia, including fold-out interior side tables ideal for laptops, places to hang med kits, and stowage for camping gear.\nBuilt in V2L, or vehicle-to-load, means that the camper‚Äîmuch like most Kias now‚Äîwill be able to power any household electric appliance, which is a boon out in the wild. Inside at the front, a 12.9-inch infotainment screen in the front runs an Android Automotive OS, while the driver gets a 7in digital instrument cluster.\nJust like Kia's WKNDR concept, the Light Camper is intended as an ‚Äúescape pod for extended weekends in nature,‚Äù and should feature a similarly flexible modular interior that can be easily customized for various pursuits. Kia called its concept a ‚ÄúSwiss Army Knife on wheels,‚Äù which would also feature a mobile pantry for ‚Äúcooking aficionados that want to cook with a view.‚Äù Here's hoping a mobile kitchen to rival the likes of Rivian is on the cards.\nWe're also hoping Kia's previous idea of installing an onboard compressor to handle adjusting tire pressure when out on the trail, and inflating mattresses when setting up camp for the night makes it to the production version of the Light Camper too.\nLooking to fill out its EV range to include an mini urban SUV, Kia has today also revealed the EV2. It's a concept, yes, but the auto company has already said that it's definitely coming in 2026 and‚Äîmuch like all its recent concepts‚Äîthe exterior will remain largely unchanged. The minimalist interior? Nope. Yes the sliding seats are fancy, but Karim Habib, head of global design at Kia, confirmed to WIRED that it was unlikely the inside will look anything like the concept offering.\nBefore we get to that, the exterior looks like a surprisingly successful shrinking of the excellent EV9, and that's a good thing. Think of it as an SUV-ified Kia Soul, if you will, but with rear-hinged doors at the back‚Äîthough these will not make it to the final production model. Destined for the European market early next year at around ‚Ç¨30,000 ($31,000), this will compete with the likes of the Renault 5, Hyundai Inster, and Skoda Epiq.\nPowertrain details could well be subject to change, but Kia has confirmed that this entry-level EV will boast a 55-kWh battery giving 270 miles of range, as well as a new LFP iteration with around 185 miles. Vehicle-to-load bi-directional charging will also be featured, so this means that along with the somewhat niche design theme of \"picnics in the city,‚Äù the EV2 could power a post-sandwich projector and sound system setup too.\nAfter so many tease images, it was almost no reveal at all, Kia has also taken the covers off its final production version of the EV4 sedan, which also comes in a hatchback version. It has both 58.3-kWh and 81.4-kWh long-range battery options and a super-low drag coefficient of 0.23 Cd, helped by full underbody covers for better aerodynamics. This means a claimed WLTP maximum of 390 miles on the long-range model and 267 miles on the standard‚Äîand this drops down to 367 and 255 miles respectively on the hatchback. Performance? The 150-kW motor will apparently be good for 0 to 62 mph in 7.4 seconds, with a price of ‚Ç¨37,000 ($39,000).\nThe EV4's charging will go from 10 to 80 percent in as little as 31 minutes if you find the right charger, and inside you get a typically attractive Kia interior that's been set up to at least attempt to alleviate some boredom while topping up mid-trip. Rest Mode will set the front-row relaxation seats back, as well as activate a ‚Äúmood lamp to create a comforting atmosphere.‚Äù The 12.3-inch, 5.3-inch, and 12.3-inch screens that make up the EV4‚Äôs 30-inch wide-screen display are brought to bear with in \"Vehicle Smart TV,‚Äù where YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, games, and karaoke are on tap‚Äîplus there's support for a 21:9 aspect ratio and a ‚ÄúTheatre Mode,‚Äù which brings interior mood lighting and the eight-speaker sound system into play. Trunk space is 490 liters (435 for the hatch), but the opening to get in there is surprisingly tight.\nSafety kit includes highway driving assist and forward collision avoidance, and there‚Äôs also an assistance system called the ‚ÄúDriver Package F+‚Äù, which uses camera and radar to warn of hazards ahead. Mercifully, there's also a steering wheel button that allows you to mute the speed-warning beeps and bongs with one touch.",

Learn more.\nThe original Framework Laptop‚Äôs sales pitch was that it wanted to bring some of the modularity and repairability of the desktop PC ecosystem to a functional, thin, and light laptop. For nearly half a decade, the company has made good on that promise with multiple motherboard upgrades and other tweaks for the original 13-inch Framework Laptop; with the Framework Laptop 16 and Laptop 12, the company has tried to bring the same ethos to gaming/workstation laptops and budget PCs for students.\nOne of Framework's announcements this week was for the company's first desktop PC. Unsurprisingly dubbed the Framework Desktop, it's aimed less at the general-purpose PC crowd and more at people who want the smallest, most powerful desktop they can build and will pay extra money to get it. Preorders for this system start now, and Framework says it should ship in Q3 of 2025.\nHere was my first question: What does a company trying to build a more desktop-like laptop have to bring to the desktop ecosystem, where things are already standardized, upgradeable, and repairable?\nThe answer, at least for the Framework Desktop announced today: a gaming PC that takes advantage of many PC standards and offers a unique combination of small size and high performance, but which is otherwise substantially less modular and upgradeable than a mini PC you can already buy or build for yourself.\nTiny but Fast\nThe Framework Desktop is powered by an AMD Ryzen AI Max processor, a Radeon 8060S integrated GPU, and between 32 GB and 128 GB of soldered-in RAM. Over at Ars, we reviewed a more thermally constrained version of these chips in the Asus ROG Flow Z13 tablet‚Äîdespite technically being an ‚Äúintegrated‚Äù GPU built into the same silicon as the CPU, the number of compute units (up to 40, based on AMD‚Äôs RDNA 3.5 architecture) plus the high-speed bank of soldered-in RAM gives it performance similar to a midrange dedicated laptop GPU.\nIn Framework's first-party case, the PC starts at $1,099, which gets you a Ryzen AI Max 385 (that's an 8-core CPU and 32 GPU cores) and 32 GB of RAM. A fully loaded 128 GB with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 configuration (16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores) will run you $1,999. There's also an in-between build with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip and 64 GB of RAM for $1,599. If you just want the mini ITX board to put in a case of your choosing, that starts at $799.\nNone of these are impulse buys, exactly, but they're priced a bit better than a gaming-focused mini PC like the Asus ROG NUC, which starts at nearly $1,300 as of this writing and comes with half as much RAM. It's also priced well compared to what you can get out of a DIY mini ITX PC based on integrated graphics‚Äîthe Ryzen 7 8700G, an AM5 ITX motherboard, and 32 GB of DDR5 can all be had for around $500 collectively before you add a case, power supply, or SSD, but for considerably slower performance.\nThe volume of the Framework Desktop's first-party case is just 4.5 liters‚Äîfor reference, the SSUPD Meshroom S is 14.9 liters, a fairly middle-of-the-road volume for an ITX case that can fit a full-size GPU. An Xbox Series X is about 6.9 liters, and the Xbox Series S is 4.4 liters. Apple's Mac Studio is about 3.7 liters. The Framework Desktop isn't breaking records, but it's definitely tiny.\nSo the pitch for the system is easy: You get a reasonably powerful 1440p-capable gaming and workstation PC inside a case the size of a small game console. ‚ÄúIf the Series S could run Windows, I'd buy it in a second‚Äù is a thought that has occurred to me, so I can see the appeal, even though it costs at least three times as much.\nBut it does feel like a strange fit for Framework, given that it's so much less upgradeable than most PCs. The CPU and GPU are one piece of silicon, and they're soldered to the motherboard. The RAM is also soldered down and not upgradeable once you've bought it, setting it apart from nearly every other board Framework sells.\n‚ÄúTo enable the massive 256GB/s memory bandwidth that Ryzen AI Max delivers, the LPDDR5x is soldered,‚Äù writes Framework CEO Nirav Patel in a post about this week's announcements. ‚ÄúWe spent months working with AMD to explore ways around this but ultimately determined that it wasn‚Äôt technically feasible to land modular memory at high throughput with the 256-bit memory bus. Because the memory is non-upgradeable, we‚Äôre being deliberate in making memory pricing more reasonable than you might find with other brands.‚Äù\nPatel notes that Framework ‚Äúleveraged all of the key PC standards everywhere we could.‚Äù That starts with a mini ITX board that uses standard ATX headers so it can fit into any PC case. The system's 400-W power supply is based on the established Flex ATX standard, and its 120-mm fans (made in cooperation with Cooler Master and Noctua) can be swapped out for any other fan of the same size.\nThe system also retains some modularity, with swappable black or translucent side panels, an optional carrying handle, 21 customizable tiles on the front (which can be either bought or 3D-printed), and two slots on the front for the same expansion cards used for Framework Laptops. The system also includes a PCI Express slot with four lanes of bandwidth and two M.2 2280 slots for SSDs. Rear I/O includes two USB4 ports, two DisplayPorts, an HDMI port, and a 5-gigabit Ethernet port.\nFramework says the Desktop will work with not just Windows 11 and the typical Ubuntu and Fedora Linux distributions but also with more gaming-focused Linux distributions like Playtron OS and the SteamOS-based Bazzite. (We don't know whether the Framework Desktop will be supported by actual SteamOS when Valve starts distributing it on third-party PCs, but the desktop seems like a near-ideal way to resurrect the dead Steam Machine idea).\nSo while the non-upgradeable nature of key system components make this machine seem distinctively un-Framework-like, it is Framework-like in that it attempts to identify and address an underserved market niche with something as standards-based as possible. To those looking to put together a more fully modular system with a user-replaceable CPU, GPU, and memory, I'm sure the Framework team would be the first to point you toward the wider PC ecosystem.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "Few agencies have been spared as Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has ripped through the United States federal government. Even in Antarctica, scientists and workers are feeling the impacts‚Äîand are terrified for what‚Äôs to come.\nThe United States Antarctic Program (USAP) operates three permanent stations in Antarctica. These remote stations are difficult to get to and difficult to maintain; scattered across the continent, they are built on volcanic hills, polar plateaus, and icy peninsulas.\nBut to the US, the science has been worth it. At these stations, over a thousand people each year come to the continent to live and work. Scientists operate a number of major research projects, studying everything from climate change and rising sea levels to the cosmological makeup and origins of the universe itself. With funding cuts and layoffs looming, Antarctic scientists and experts don‚Äôt know if their research will be able to continue, how US stations will be sustained, or what all this might mean for the continent‚Äôs delicate geopolitics.\n‚ÄúEven brief interruptions will result in people walking away and not coming back,‚Äù says Nathan Whitehorn, an associate professor and Antarctic scientist at Michigan State University. ‚ÄúIt could easily take decades to rebuild.‚Äù\nThe USAP is managed by the National Science Foundation. Last week, a number of NSF program managers staffed on Antarctic projects were fired as part of a wider purge at the agency. The program managers are critical for maintaining communication with the infrastructure and logistics arm of the NSF, and the contractors for the USAP, as well as planning deployment for scientists to the continent, keeping track of the budgets, and funding the maintenance and operations work. ‚ÄúI have no idea what we do without them,‚Äù says another Antarctic scientist who has spent time on the continent, who along with several others WIRED granted anonymity due to fears of retaliation.\n‚ÄúWithout them, everything stops,‚Äù says a scientist whose NSF project manager was fired last week. ‚ÄúI have no idea who I am supposed to report to now or what happens to submitted proposals.‚Äù\nScientific research happens at all of the stations. At the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, scientists work on the South Pole Telescope and BICEP telescope, both of which study the cosmic background radiation and the evolution of the universe; IceCube, a cubic-kilometer detector designed to study neutrino physics and high energy emission from astrophysical sources; and the Atmospheric Research Observatory that studies climate science and is run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (Mass firings are also expected at the NOAA.)\n‚ÄúThe climate science [at the South Pole Station] is super unique,‚Äù an Antarctic scientist says. ‚ÄúThe site has so little pollution that we call it ‚Äòthe cleanest air on Earth,‚Äô and they have been monitoring the ozone layer and CO2 content in the atmosphere for many decades.‚Äù\nOther directives from the Donald Trump administration have directly affected daily life on those stations. ‚ÄúGender-inclusive terms on housing documents‚Äù have been removed from Antarctic staffer forms, a source familiar with the situation at McMurdo Station tells WIRED. ‚ÄúIt asked if you had a preference with which gender you housed with,‚Äù the source says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all been removed.‚Äù\nStaffers have already pushed back. ‚ÄúPeople have been painting waste bins saying ‚ÄúAntarctica is for ALL‚Äù in rainbow, people‚Äôs email signatures [have] pride additions, [others] keep adding preferred pronouns to emails,‚Äù the source says.\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a sense of unease on the station like people have never felt before,‚Äù they add. ‚ÄúThe job still has to get done, even though people feel like the next shoe can drop at any moment.‚Äù\nThat unease extends to their own job security. ‚ÄúThere are some people currently at the South Pole that are worried about losing their jobs any day now,‚Äù a source with familiarity of the situation tells WIRED. Workers present at the station aren‚Äôt able to physically leave until October, and a midseason firing, or loss of funding, would present a unique set of challenges.\nSources are also bracing for at least a 50 percent reduction in the NSF‚Äôs budget due to DOGE cuts. These cuts are sending Antarctic scientists with assistants and graduate students scrambling. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know if we could pay graduate students,‚Äù says one scientist. While research is conducted on the continent, scientists bring their findings back to the US to process and analyze. A lot of the funding also operates the science itself: For one project that requires electricity to run detectors, the scientist ‚Äúwas paranoid we would not be able to literally pay bills for an experiment starved for data.‚Äù That hasn‚Äôt come to fruition yet, but as funding cycles restart in the coming weeks and months, scientists are on tenterhooks.\nSources tell WIRED that Germany, Canada, Spain, and China have already started taking advantage of that uncertainty by recruiting US scientists focused on Antarctica.\n‚ÄúForeign countries are actively recruiting my colleagues, and some have already left,‚Äù says one Antarctic scientist. ‚ÄúMy students are looking at jobs overseas now ‚Ä¶ people have been coming [to the US] to do science my whole life. Now people are going the other way.‚Äù\n‚ÄúNow is a great time to see if anyone wants to jump ship,‚Äù another Antarctic scientist says. ‚ÄúI do worry about a brain drain of tenured academics, or students who are shunted out.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe damage caused by gutting the [Antarctic] science budget like this is going to last generations,‚Äù says another.\nThroughout DOGE‚Äôs cuts to the federal government, representatives have said that if something needs to be brought back, it could be. In some cases, reversals have already happened: The US Department of Agriculture said it accidentally fired staffers working on preventing the spread of bird flu and is trying to rehire them.\nBut in Antarctica, a reversal won‚Äôt necessarily work. ‚ÄúOne of the really scary things about this is that if the Antarctic program budget is cut, then they‚Äôll very quickly get to the point where they can‚Äôt even keep the station open, much less science projects going,‚Äù an Antarctic scientist tells WIRED. ‚ÄúIf the South Pole [station] is shut down, it‚Äôs basically nearly impossible to bring it back up. Everything will freeze and get buried in snow. And some other country will likely immediately take over.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86.\nOthers share this fear of a station takeover. ‚ÄúEven if science funding is cut back, there is an urgent need for the US to invest in icebreakers and polar airlift capability otherwise at some point the US-managed South Pole station might not be serviceable,‚Äù says Klaus Dodds, an Antarctic expert and professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway University of London.\nExperts are concerned that countries like Russia and China‚Äîwho have already been eagle-eyed on continental influence‚Äîwill quickly jostle to fill the power vacuum. ‚ÄúPresumably it would be humiliating for anyone who wishes to promote ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô to witness China offer to take over the occupation and management of the base at the heart of Antarctica. China is a very determined polar power,‚Äù says Dodds.\nThe political outcome of the US pulling back from its Antarctic research and presence could be dire, sources tell WIRED.\nAntarctica isn‚Äôt owned by any one country. Instead it‚Äôs governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, which protects Antarctica and the scientific research taking place on the continent, and forbids mining and nuclear activity. Some countries, including China and Russia, have indicated that they would be interested in rule changes to the Treaty system, particularly around resource extraction and fishing restrictions. The US, traditionally, has played a key role in championing the treaty: ‚ÄúMany of the leading polar scientists and social scientists are either US citizens and/or have been enriched by contact with US-led programs,‚Äù says Dodds.\nThat leadership role could change quickly. The US also participates in a number of international collaborations involving major Antarctic scientific projects. A US pullback, Whitehorn says, ‚Äúmakes it very hard to regard the US as a reliable partner, so I think there will be a lot less interest in accepting US leadership in such things ‚Ä¶ The uncertainty will drive people away and sacrifice the leadership the US already has.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIf the NSF can‚Äôt function, or we don‚Äôt fund it, projects with long lead times can just die,‚Äù another scientist says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure international partners would be happy to partner elsewhere. This is what it means to lose US competitiveness.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "The plea for help arrived last summer. ‚ÄúI am in Myanmar and work for a fraud company,‚Äù a Chinese human-trafficking victim wrote in a short email sent from within the Tai Chang scam compound. Like thousands of others in the region, they were promised legitimate work only to find themselves tricked into modern slavery and forced to scam people online for hours every day. Tai Chang, which backs on to the Myanmar-Thailand border, has been linked to incidents of torture. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not safe, I‚Äôm chatting with you secretly,‚Äù they said. Despite the risk, their first request wasn‚Äôt to be rescued.\nTai Chang‚Äôs internet connection had recently been cut off from Thailand, the person wrote in the messages to anti-scam group GASO in June 2024. Instead of scamming within the compound grinding to a halt, the organized criminals behind the operation found another way to stay online, they claimed. ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äôs Starlink is installed above all the buildings in the campus where we are now,‚Äù the individual wrote. ‚ÄúNow the fraud work is running normally. If the fraud network here is down, we can regain our freedom.‚Äù\nThose messages soon landed on the desk of Erin West, then deputy district attorney for Santa Clara County, California. West, a longtime advocate for victims of so-called pig butchering and other types of cryptocurrency scams, wrote to a lawyer at SpaceX, the company behind Musk‚Äôs high-speed Starlink satellite internet system. Starlink connections appeared to be helping criminals at Tai Chang to ‚Äúscam Americans‚Äù and ‚Äúfuel their internet needs,‚Äù West alleged at the end of July 2024. She offered to share more information to help the company in ‚Äúdisrupting the work of bad actors.‚Äù\nSpaceX and Starlink never replied, West claims.\nReports of the use of Starlink at Tai Chang are not a one-off‚Äîcriminals running multibillion-dollar empires across Southeast Asia appear to be widely using the satellite internet network. At least eight scam compounds based around the Myanmar-Thailand border region are using Starlink devices, according to mobile phone connection data reviewed by WIRED. Between November 2024 and the start of February, hundreds of mobile phones logged their locations and use of Starlink at known scam compounds more than 40,000 times, according to the mobile phone data, which was collected by an online advertising industry tool.\nThe eight compounds, spread around the Myawaddy region of war-torn Myanmar, likely have installed multiple Starlink devices. Photos of Tai Chang reviewed by WIRED appear to show dozens of white Starlink satellite dishes on a single rooftop, while human rights watchdogs and other experts say that Starlink use at the scam compounds has increased in the past year.\n‚ÄúI believe that SpaceX must have the capacity to stop this problem,‚Äù says Rangsiman Rome, an opposition member of the House of Representatives in Thailand who chairs a parliamentary committee on national security and border issues. At the start of February, Rome tagged Musk in a post on X, saying criminals are ‚Äúexploiting Starlink for massive fraud‚Äù at scam compounds in the region. He did not get a reply, he says.\n‚ÄúWe know exactly where the compounds are,‚Äù Rome says. ‚ÄúIf we can target which compound uses Starlink and collaborate with SpaceX, we can stop the compound using Starlink.‚Äù\nStarlink‚Äôs policies state that SpaceX may terminate services to users if they participate in ‚Äúfraudulent‚Äù activities or if a system is used in unauthorized locations. It has previously emailed users in locations it doesn‚Äôt officially offer services to and threatened to shut down accounts.\nThe use of Starlink comes as officials in Thailand, Myanmar, and China have recently attempted to crack down on scam compounds, freeing thousands. However, support services for trafficking victims have faced USAID funding cuts from Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk‚Äôs ownership of the satellite network while serving as a federal employee has also fallen under increasing scrutiny, with reports suggesting Starlink connections could be turned off in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the US Federal Aviation Administration is reportedly expanding its use of Starklink devices.\n‚ÄúOur own technology is being used against us,‚Äù says West, who founded the nonprofit Operation Shamrock to take action against investment scammers. ‚ÄúStarlink is an American company, and it is the backbone for how these bad actors are able to access Americans.‚Äù\nWIRED sent SpaceX a list of questions about the alleged use of Starlink at scam compounds, including coordinates of suspected scam compounds where phones have connected to the Starlink network. SpaceX did not respond to the request for comment.\n‚ÄúIf SpaceX obtains knowledge that a Starlink terminal is being used by a sanctioned or unauthorized party, we investigate the claim and take actions to deactivate the terminal if confirmed,‚Äù the company has previously said.\nThe green, mountainous border separating Myanmar and Thailand runs for 1,500 miles. Around 200 miles of the border follows the Moei River, where dozens of compounds have replaced valley fields over the past five years. Rome, the Thai MP, says officials have identified 75 compounds across Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, with 40 of those being in Myanmar‚Äôs Myawaddy region.\nFrom the outside, the compounds resemble hotels or apartment blocks, but they are surrounded by high fences, watch towers, and armed guards. People have been trafficked from more than 60 countries. Around 120,000 people are likely held in scam compounds across Myanmar, according to one United Nations report from 2023, with another 100,000 captive in Cambodia. (Starlink has recently agreed to increase its availability in Cambodia, according to local reports.)\nWithin the compounds, which often have close links to Chinese organized crime groups and online gambling syndicates, victims are typically forced to work day and night to scam hundreds of people at a time. This includes carrying out long-running investment scams that have netted criminals up to $75 billion over the past few years. If the trafficking victims don‚Äôt comply, they are often beaten or tortured. Escape or paying a ransom is often the only way out.\nStable internet connections are crucial for the operations to be successful‚Äîfrom the initial targeting of potential human trafficking victims with false job postings to daily scamming and ultimately money laundering. Palm Naripthaphan, an executive adviser at Thailand‚Äôs National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), says scam centers along the border have historically used mobile connections from cell carriers in Myanmar or Thailand. They can also connect to fiber-optic cables in Thailand or run them across the river Moei, Naripthaphan says. Increasingly, Naripthaphan believes, Starlink has played a role.\nThe Musk-owned satellite system is composed of multiple elements. More than 6,000 Starlink satellites orbit Earth and beam down internet connectivity to white, rectangular Starlink dishes (dubbed Dishy McFlatface). Some are portable and easy to set up, and they provide internet connections in areas where there is little or no other options, including war zones such as Ukraine.\nStarlink is not officially licensed in Myanmar, which has been embroiled in a bloody civil war since a military coup in 2021, and the service has reportedly been banned by the military junta. The company‚Äôs coverage map doesn‚Äôt list any availability in the country. But this hasn‚Äôt stopped Starlink terminals working and being frequently used in Myanmar to combat frequent internet shutdowns.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really the best thing going,‚Äù says David Eubank, the founder of the Free Burma Rangers, a Christian organization that provides humanitarian aid and tracks human rights abuses in Myanmar. The group uses around 80 Starlink systems to coordinate humanitarian relief, he says, adding that any blanket ban would be harmful. ‚ÄúIf you can find perpetrators who are misusing it, you penalize them, but you don't just shut the whole network down.‚Äù\nAcross eight known scam compound areas‚ÄîKK Park, Tai Chang, Dongmei, Huanya, UK Compound, Gate 25, Apolo, and Shwe Kokko‚Äîmobile phones have logged thousands of occurrences of getting online using Starklink‚Äôs networks in recent months, according to data seen by WIRED. At least 412 devices listed Starlink as their internet provider at the compound locations between November and February, according to an analyst with access to location data from the online advertising industry. In total, 40,800 instances were logged.\n‚ÄúLast summer, when I was pulling data and I started to see Starlink pop up, I was surprised. Now I would be surprised if I pulled data for a compound and it didn‚Äôt have at least one Starlink connection pop up,‚Äù says the analyst, who was granted anonymity because they don‚Äôt have permission to talk publicly about the tools they use. At every compound they have checked, they say, they have found data indicating Starlink usage.\nThe analyst used an ad-tech tool, which they declined to name, to search areas around known scam compounds for records of mobile phone usage. The murky data broker industry sells highly specific data that‚Äôs collected by apps people use on their phones. The tool used by the analyst provides a phone‚Äôs IP address, physical coordinates, and the internet service provider they are using. The full results for the compounds included internet and cell providers from Thailand, Myanmar cell carriers, remote servers, and Starlink, the analyst says.\nAt KK Park, one of the largest and well-known scamming sites, which is shown above, at least 127 devices recorded 24,000 Starlink connections over three months. In total, 2,907 devices were active in the area, although around 800 of these did not list any particular carrier data, the analyst says.\n‚ÄúI am confident that everything that we‚Äôre seeing in the data is linked to scams in some way,‚Äù the analyst says, noting that the victims who are forced to run scams are often given multiple mobile phones or telephone numbers to run the scams. They say the data is a snapshot and likely an undercount of how often Starlink is used. IP addresses in the data frequently point to Malaysia, the analyst says, indicating that may be where the systems are registered.\nWhile multiple devices can connect to a single Starlink terminal, it‚Äôs unclear how many physical Starlink receivers are at the compounds. A standard Starlink kit can cover an area of up to 297 square meters, while a smaller version covers up to 112 square meters, according to Starlink‚Äôs website. The analyst suggests that multiple Starlink systems may be used at some compounds because multiple criminal groups work from the same locations.\nPhotos of the Tai Chang compound‚Äîwhere the trafficking victim who complained about Starlink is still based‚Äîappear to show dozens of Starlink receiver dishes. Dozens of white, small objects are positioned on top of the buildings. ‚ÄúThey just put [Starlink] on the roof, and we have the photos,‚Äù Rome, the Thai politician, alleges.\nNaripthaphan, from Thailand‚Äôs NBTC regulator, says that officials have been trying to disrupt internet connections to the scam compounds‚Äîincluding limiting cell coverage, cutting connections, and dismantling base stations‚Äîsince May 2024. ‚ÄúThey start using [Starlink] when the mobile operators start shutting down the services across the border and we start arresting all the broadband fiber connectivities that are smuggling through the channels,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe see that increase in Starlink users when those services are being blocked.‚Äù Naripthaphan says the NBTC has been talking with SpaceX to get Starlink regulated in the country.\nOver the past year, according to a United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report published in October, officials in Thailand seized 78 Starlink receivers that are believed to have been heading for scam compounds in Myanmar. Other Starlink devices have been seized by Myanmar‚Äôs government.\nAt the start of February, Thailand cut internet connections, electricity, and fuel supplies to some areas around the compounds. Thousands of people have since been rescued by officials in one of the most widespread crackdowns on the compounds so far. Mechelle B Moore, the CEO of anti-trafficking nonprofit Global Alms Incorporated, says some shelters are struggling to cope with the amount of people being freed. But past efforts to disrupt scam operations by shutting off internet connections have not been effective, partly due to Starlink connectivity.\n‚ÄúWe have not heard of any companies shutting down or suspending operations because they don‚Äôt have access to the internet,‚Äù says Moore, who adds that multiple trafficking survivors she has spoken with have mentioned their use of Starlink. ‚ÄúVictims will all confirm that they‚Äôre flipped over to Starlink or they use cellular dongles with SIM cards in them. When one doesn‚Äôt work, they just flick over to the other. It doesn‚Äôt stop operations at all.‚Äù\nFollowing the start of the most recent crackdown, the analyst with access to data about Starlink use says, records show that at least six of the compounds have devices accessing Starlink.",

Specifically, they took the A train, as it ping-ponged the 32 miles between the northern tip of Manhattan and the southern reaches of Queens.\nThe phones weren‚Äôt stowaways or strays, and an extremely sharp-eyed passenger could tell because they were inside plastic enclosures and secured via brackets to the cars‚Äô undersides and interiors. While people inside the cars used their smartphones to write emails or scroll Instagram or explore Roblox, the subway operators were using these phones‚Äô sensors‚Äîaccelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes, and for those attached to the cars‚Äô exteriors, additional external microphones‚Äîto listen intently.\nThe phones were part of a brief experiment by New York City‚Äôs Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Google into whether cheap, mostly off-the-shelf technology could supplement the agency‚Äôs track inspection work. (Google Public Sector, the division that undertook the work, didn‚Äôt charge the MTA for this initial experiment.) Today, inspections are carried out by human inspectors, who together walk all 665 miles of New York City‚Äôs subway tracks, eyes peeled for problems like broken rails, busted signals, and water damage. Thrice-annual rides by specialized, sensor-laden ‚Äútrain geometry cars,‚Äù also capture and upload more sophisticated data on the status of the city‚Äôs rail infrastructure.\nNew York City Transit‚Äôs work with the experimental technology, which Google calls TrackInspect, suggests that audio, vibration, and location data, collected relatively cheaply and used to train artificial intelligence prediction models, can supplement that inspection work. It can point humans toward suspicious rattles, bangs, or squeals, suggesting what kinds of tools they‚Äôll need to make the repairs before they get there. Throughout the four-month project, the tech was able to identify 92 percent of the defect locations later pinpointed by human track inspectors, the MTA says.\nEventually, the tech could become ‚Äúa way we could minimize the amount of work that‚Äôs done to identify those defects, and point inspectors in the right direction, so they can spend time fixing instead of identifying, and go directly there and do the work,‚Äù says Demetrius Crichlow, the agency‚Äôs president. In the future, the MTA hopes to create a ‚Äúmodernized‚Äù system that automatically identifies and organizes fixes for track issues.\nFor the system‚Äôs 3.7 million daily riders, catching defects before they become problems could be the difference between getting to work or school on time and getting mired in unexpected delays.\n‚ÄúThe goal with this [project] is to find issues before they become a major issue in terms of service,‚Äù says Crichlow. The collaboration with Google will now expand to a full pilot project, the MTA says, where Google will build a production version of the tech and put it in the hands of track inspectors themselves.\nInspectors‚Äô Gadgets\nThe Google experiment is part of a bumper crop of AI-enabled technology that transit agencies are just beginning to use to supplement their typical inspections, says Brian Poston, an assistant vice president of transit and rail with the consultancy WSP. While New York is unique in using ‚Äúharmonics‚Äù‚Äîaudio and vibration‚Äîto pinpoint issues, others have installed small sensors or cameras on tracks that take automated measurements and flag discrepancies as they emerge. The tech is enabled not just by advances in machine learning, but also cheaper and smaller batteries and processors.\nStill, US regulators require regular human inspection and maintenance of rails, and Poston says he doesn‚Äôt expect those rules to go away anytime soon. ‚ÄúUntil the technology can be specific and precise, you‚Äôre always going to need that human interaction,‚Äù he says.\nIn New York, one particular human played an outsize role in labeling the audio and vibration data collected by the mounted phones. In between the rest of his work, NYCT assistant chief track officer Robert Sarno, a 14-year veteran of the MTA, threw on his noise-canceling headphones and listened through five- to 10-minute snippets of track noise to sort the regular subway din from audio signatures of track trouble.\n‚ÄúI would listen to it and mark down ‚Äòloose joint,‚Äô ‚Äòloose bolt,‚Äô rail defect,‚Äô ‚Äòtie defect.‚Äô And then inspectors would go out in the field and come back with pictures to back it up.‚Äù\nBy himself, Sarno hit more than a 80 percent correlation with track defects‚Äînot too much worse than the machine learning models. ‚ÄúThrough years of experience, you learn certain sounds,‚Äù says Sarno, who spent the first ten years of his MTA career underground. (Maybe he‚Äôs also really good at it‚Äîanother transit official called Sarno ‚Äúthe track whisperer.‚Äù)\nAlong with Sarno‚Äôs labeling, TrackInspect combined 335 million sensor readings and 1,200 hours of audio with New York City Transit‚Äôs database of track defects to train a group of about 200 individual prediction models to find track issues, Google says.\nWhile TrackInspect was built just for the MTA, Google Public Sector field chief technology officer Chris Hein says the firm hopes the project will become a ‚Äúcatalyst for ushering in more cost-effective and preventive ways to support railway safety.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "On February 10, employees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) received an email asking them to list every contract at the bureau and note whether or not it was ‚Äúcritical‚Äù to the agency, as well as whether it contained any DEI components. This email was signed by Scott Langmack, who identified himself as a senior adviser to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Langmack, according to his LinkedIn, already has another job: He‚Äôs the chief operating officer of Kukun, a property technology company that is, according to its website, ‚Äúon a long-term mission to aggregate the hardest to find data.‚Äù\nAs is the case with other DOGE operatives‚ÄîTom Krause, for example, is performing the duties of the fiscal assistant secretary at the Treasury while holding down a day job as a software CEO at a company with millions in contracts with the Treasury‚Äîthis could potentially create a conflict of interest, especially given a specific aspect of his role: According to sources and government documents reviewed by WIRED, Langmack has application-level access to some of the most critical and sensitive systems inside HUD, one of which contains records mapping billions of dollars in expenditures.\nAnother DOGE operative WIRED has identified is Michael Mirski, who works for TCC Management, a Michigan-based company that owns and operates mobile home parks across the US, and graduated from the Wharton School in 2014. (In a story he wrote for the school‚Äôs website, he asserted that the most important thing he learned there was to ‚ÄúDevelop the infrastructure to collect data.‚Äù) According to the documents, he has write privileges on‚Äîmeaning he can input overall changes to‚Äîa system that controls who has access to HUD systems.\nBetween them, records reviewed by WIRED show, the DOGE operatives have access to five different HUD systems. According to a HUD source with direct knowledge, this gives the DOGE operatives access to vast troves of data. These range from the individual identities of every single federal public housing voucher holder in the US, along with their financial information, to information on the hospitals, nursing homes, multifamily housing, and senior living facilities that HUD helps finance, as well as data on everything from homelessness rates to environmental and health hazards to federally insured mortgages.\nPut together, experts and HUD sources say, all of this could give someone with access unique insight into the US real estate market.\nKukun did not respond to requests for comment about whether Langmack is drawing a salary while working at HUD or how long he will be with the department. A woman who answered the phone at TCC Management headquarters in Michigan but did not identify herself said Mirksi was \"on leave until July.\" In response to a request for comment about Langmack‚Äôs access to systems, HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett said, ‚ÄúDOGE and HUD are working as a team; to insinuate anything else is false. To further illustrate this unified mission, the secretary established a HUD DOGE taskforce.‚Äù In response to specific questions about Mirski‚Äôs access to systems and background and qualifications, she said, ‚ÄúWe have not‚Äîand will not‚Äîcomment on individual personnel. We are focused on serving the American people and working as one team.‚Äù\nThe property technology, or proptech, market covers a wide range of companies offering products and services meant to, for example, automate tenant-landlord interactions, or expedite the home purchasing process. Kukun focuses on helping homeowners and real estate investors assess the return on investment they‚Äôd get from renovating their properties and on predictive analytics that model where property values will rise in the future.\nDoing this kind of estimation requires the use of what‚Äôs called an automated valuation model (AVM), a machine-learning model that predicts the prices or rents of certain properties. In April 2024, Kukun was one of eight companies selected to receive support from REACH, an accelerator run by the venture capital arm of the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Last year NAR agreed to a settlement with Missouri homebuyers, who alleged that realtor fees and certain listing requirements were anticompetitive.\n‚ÄúIf you can better predict than others how a certain neighborhood will develop, you can invest in that market,‚Äù says Fabian Braesemann, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. Doing so requires data, access to which can make any machine-learning model more accurate and more monetizable. This is the crux of the potential conflict of interest: While it is unclear how Langmack and Mirski are using or interpreting it in their roles at HUD, what is clear is that they have access to a wide range of sensitive data.\nAccording to employees at HUD who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity, there is currently a six-person DOGE team operating within the department. Four members are HUD employees whose tenures predate the current administration and have been assigned to the group; the others are Mirski and Langmack. The records reviewed by WIRED show that Mirski has been given read and write access to three different HUD systems, as well as read-only access to two more, while Langmack has been given read and write access to two of HUD‚Äôs core systems.\nA positive, from one source‚Äôs perspective, is the fact that the DOGE operatives have been given application-level access to the systems, rather than direct access to the databases themselves. In theory, this means that they can only interact with the data through user interfaces, rather than having direct access to the server, which could allow them to execute queries directly on the database or make unrestricted or irreparable changes. However, this source still sees dangers inherent in granting this level of access.\n‚ÄúThere are probably a dozen-plus ways that [application-level] read/write access to WASS or LOCCS could be translated into the entire databases being exfiltrated,‚Äù they said. There is no specific reason to think that DOGE operatives have inappropriately moved data‚Äîbut even the possibility cuts against standard security protocols that HUD sources say are typically in place.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at velliott88.18 or davidgilbert.01.\nLOCCS, or Line of Credit Control System, is the first system to which both DOGE operatives within HUD, according to the records reviewed by WIRED, have both read and write access. Essentially HUD‚Äôs banking system, LOCCS ‚Äúhandles disbursement and cash management for the majority of HUD grant programs,‚Äù according to a user guide. Billions of dollars flow through the system every year, funding everything from public housing to disaster relief‚Äîsuch as rebuilding from the recent LA wildfires‚Äîto food security programs and rent payments.\nThe current balance in the LOCCS system, according to a record reviewed by WIRED, is over $100 billion‚Äîmoney Congress has approved for HUD projects but which has yet to be drawn down. Much of this money has been earmarked to cover disaster assistance and community development work, a source at the agency says.\nNormally, those who have access to LOCCS require additional processing and approvals to access the system, and most only have ‚Äúread‚Äù access, department employees say.\n‚ÄúRead/write is used for executing contracts and grants on the LOCCS side,‚Äù says one person. ‚ÄúIt normally has strict banking procedures around doing anything with funds. For instance, you usually need at least two people to approve any decisions‚Äîsame as you would with bank tellers in a physical bank.‚Äù\nThe second system to which documents indicate both DOGE operatives at HUD have both read and write access is the HUD Central Accounting and Program System (HUDCAPS), an ‚Äúintegrated management system for Section 8 programs under the jurisdiction of the Office of Public and Indian Housing,‚Äù according to HUD. (Section 8 is a federal program administered through local housing agencies that provides rental assistance, in the form of vouchers, to millions of lower-income families.) This system was a precursor to LOCCS and is currently being phased out, but it is still being used to process the payment of housing vouchers and contains huge amounts of personal information.\nThere are currently 2.3 million families in receipt of housing vouchers in the US, according to HUD‚Äôs own data, but the HUDCAPS database contains information on significantly more individuals because historical data is retained, says a source familiar with the system. People applying for HUD programs like housing vouchers have to submit sensitive personal information, including medical records and personal narratives.\n‚ÄúPeople entrust these stories to HUD,‚Äù the source says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not data in these systems, it‚Äôs operational trust.‚Äù\nWASS, or the Web Access Security Subsystem, is the third system to which DOGE has both read and write access, though only Mirski has access to this system according to documents reviewed by WIRED. It‚Äôs used to grant permissions to other HUD systems. ‚ÄúMost of the functionality in WASS consists of looking up information stored in various tables to tell the security subsystem who you are, where you can go, and what you can do when you get there,‚Äù a user manual says.\n‚ÄúWASS is an application for provisioning rights to most if not all other HUD systems,‚Äù says a HUD source familiar with the systems who is shocked by Mirski‚Äôs level of access, because normally HUD employees don‚Äôt have read access, let alone write access. ‚ÄúWASS is the system for setting permissions for all of the other systems.‚Äù\nIn addition to these three systems, documents show that Mirski has read-only access to two others. One, the Integrated Disbursement and Information System (IDIS), is a nationwide database that tracks all HUD programs underway across the country. (‚ÄúIDIS has confidential data about hidden locations of domestic violence shelters,‚Äù a HUD source says, ‚Äúso even read access in there is horrible.‚Äù) The other is the Financial Assessment of Public Housing (FASS-PH), a database designed to ‚Äúmeasure the financial condition of public housing agencies and assess their ability to provide safe and decent housing,‚Äù according to HUD‚Äôs website.\nAll of this is significant because, in addition to the potential for privacy violations, knowing what is in the records, or even having access to them, presents a serious potential conflict of interest.\n‚ÄúThere are often bids to contract any development projects,‚Äù says Erin McElroy, an assistant professor at the University of Washington. ‚ÄúI can imagine having insider information definitely benefiting the private market, or those who will move back into the private market,‚Äù she alleges.\nHUD has an oversight role in the mobile home space, the area on which TCC Management, which appears to have recently wiped its website, focuses. \"It‚Äôs been a growing area of HUD‚Äôs work and focus over the past few decades,\" says one source there; this includes setting building standards, inspecting factories, and taking in complaints. This presents another potential conflict of interest.\nBraesemann says it‚Äôs not just the insider access to information and data that could be a potential problem, but that people coming from the private sector may not understand the point of HUD programs. Something like Section 8 housing, he notes, could be perceived as not working in alignment with market forces‚Äî‚ÄúBecause there might be higher real estate value, these people should be displaced and go somewhere else‚Äù‚Äîeven though its purpose is specifically to buffer against the market.\nLike other government agencies, HUD is facing mass purges of its workforce. NPR has reported that 84 percent of the staff of the Office of Community Planning and Development, which supports homeless people, faces termination, while the president of a union representing HUD workers has estimated that up to half the workforce could be cut The chapter on housing policy in Project 2025‚Äîthe right-wing playbook to remake the federal government that the Trump administration appears to be following‚Äîoutlines plans to massively scale back HUD programs like public housing, housing assistance vouchers, and first-time home buyer assistance.\nMatt Giles and Tim Marchman contributed reporting.",

    "content_text": "Marc Raibert, the founder of Boston Dynamics, gave the world a menagerie of two- and four-legged machines capable of jaw-dropping parkour, infectious dance routines, and industrious shelf stacking.\nRaibert is now looking to lead a revolution in robot intelligence as well as acrobatics. And he says that recent advances in machine learning at both Boston Dynamics and another institute he founded have accelerated his robots‚Äô ability to learn how to perform difficult moves without human help. ‚ÄúThe hope is that we'll be able to produce lots of behavior without having to handcraft everything that robots do,‚Äù Raibert told me recently.\nBoston Dynamics might have pioneered legged robots, but it‚Äôs now part of a crowded pack of companies offering robot dogs and humanoids. Only this week, a startup called Figure showed off a new humanoid called Helix, which can apparently unload groceries. Another company, x1, showed off a muscly-looking humanoid called NEO Gamma doing chores around the home. A third, Apptronik, said it plans to scale up the manufacturing of his humanoid, called Apollo. Demos can be misleading, though. Also, few companies disclose how much their humanoids cost, and it is unclear how many of them really expect to sell them as home helpers.\nThe real test for these robots will be how much they can do independent of human programming and direct control. And that will depend on advancements like the ones Raibert is touting. Last November I wrote about efforts to create entirely new kinds of models for controlling robots. If that work starts to bear fruit we may see humanoids and quadrupeds advance more rapidly.\nBoston Dynamics sells a four-legged robot called Spot that is used on oil rigs, construction sites, and other places where wheels struggle with the terrain. The company also makes a humanoid called Atlas. Raibert says RAI Institute used an artificial intelligence technique called reinforcement learning to upgrade Spot‚Äôs ability to run, so that it moves three times faster. The same method is also helping Atlas walk more confidently, Raibert says.\nReinforcement learning is a decades-old way of having a computer learn to do something through experimentation combined with positive or negative feedback. It came to the fore last decade when Google DeepMind showed it could produce algorithms capable of superhuman strategy and gameplay. More recently, AI engineers have used the technique to get large language models to behave themselves.\nRaibert says highly accurate new simulations have sped up what can be an arduous learning process by allowing robots to practice their moves in silico. ‚ÄúYou don't have to get as much physical behavior from the robot [to generate] good performance,‚Äù he says.\nSeveral academic groups have published work that shows how reinforcement learning can be used to improve legged locomotion. A team at UC Berkeley used the approach to train a humanoid to walk around their campus. Another group at ETH Zurich is using the method to guide quadrupeds across treacherous ground.\nBoston Dynamics has been building legged robots for decades, based on Raibert‚Äôs pioneering insights on how animals balance dynamically using the kind of low-level control provided by their nervous system. As nimble footed as the company‚Äôs machines are, however, more advanced behaviors, including dancing, doing parkour, and simply navigating around a room, normally require either careful programming or some kind of human remote control.\nIn 2022 Raibert founded the Robotics and AI (RAI) Institute to explore ways of increasing the intelligence of legged and other robots so that they can do more on their own. While we wait for robots to actually learn how to do the dishes, AI should make them less accident prone. ‚ÄúYou break fewer robots when you actually come to run the thing on the physical machine,‚Äù says Al Rizzi, chief technology officer at the RAI Institute.\nWhat do you make of the many humanoid robots now being demoed? What kinds of tasks do you think they should do? Write to us at hello@wired.com or comment below.\nCorrection: 2/27/2025, 12:00 am EDT: Marc Raibert's title and certain biographical details have been corrected, and Wired further clarified the relationship between the companies he founded and advances in machine learning.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nAmazon's new and improved version of Alexa is here, and it's called Alexa+. The next-gen upgrade is more conversational, can execute complex tasks, and is much more personalized. While the rollout starts next month on select Echo Show devices, Amazon claims it'll eventually be available on every Alexa-powered device the company has shipped. It'll cost $20 per month but will be free for Amazon Prime customers.\nHere's everything you need to know about Amazon's new and improved virtual assistant.\nAmazon says Alexa+ is ‚Äúsmarter than she's ever been before,\" capable of picking up on your tone and delivering answers in a more empathetic voice. It even has more powerful visual capabilities.\nDuring a live demo, Panos Panay, who heads up Amazon's Devices and Services department, used an Echo Show to snap a photo of the live audience and asked whether folks looked energetic. The crowd applauded at the start of the interaction, and Alexa+ analyzed the picture and said everyone looked ‚Äúpretty fired up,\" pointing out finer details like how people had laptops open, and that all eyes were on Panay.\nThe other big new feature is Alexa+'s ability to learn new information you provide. You can feed the assistant documents, emails, study guides, and recipes, and it will memorize it all, allowing you to ask for relevant information later. For example, if you upload a document of the rules from your homeowner's association, you can ask Alexa+ a question like, ‚ÄúCan I add solar panels to my house?\" It will reference the rules. You can refer to any recipes you've used before‚Äîor handwritten recipes you've fed to the assistant‚Äîand ask specific questions about ingredients or measurements.\nThe broad theme is that you can generally ask Alexa+ a question in a natural way and it should be able to help in some way. Where before you may have asked Alexa to ‚Äúshow me my doorbell feed,‚Äù now you can ask Alexa+, ‚ÄúWhen was the last time someone took the dog out for a walk?‚Äù You'll need a Ring subscription, but Alexa+ can understand the context of what it sees through your security cameras. These features match many of the capabilities Google has been promising as it injects its Gemini large language models into Google Assistant.\nAlexa+ is also supposed to be a lot easier to interact with daily. You can create routines using your voice rather than manually setting things up through the app. It‚Äôs easier to shift music throughout your house too. You can move it from speaker to speaker by simply saying, ‚ÄúPlay the music downstairs,‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlay the music everywhere, but don‚Äôt wake the baby,‚Äù and Alexa+ will know to play it in every room except the nursery.\nIn a live demo, Panay played the song ‚ÄúShallow‚Äù from A Star Is Born, and moved the song around the room by asking Alexa+ to play the music on the left side or the right. Panay said the company didn't set any prompts up and just placed the Amazon Show devices around the room, but it all worked seamlessly. He then asked Alexa+ to jump straight to the scene in the movie‚Äîit did this on a Fire TV via Amazon's Prime Video app.\nThe last time Alexa received a significant facelift was in 2023. The company announced that it was integrating advanced ChatGPT-like capabilities‚Äîwith the ability to handle more complex queries, participate in open-ended conversations (without constantly repeating ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù before each prompt), and convey emotion based on prompts. But since then, Amazon has fallen behind competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.\nLast year, there were multiple reports of Amazon's struggles with its in-house AI, which sometimes took up to seven seconds to register a prompt and reply. It was later announced that the company entered a ‚Äústrategic collaboration‚Äù with AI startup Anthropic as its ‚Äúprimary training partner.‚Äù Alexa+ utilizes both Amazon's Nova models and large language models from Anthropic, ‚Äúa model-agnostic system, allowing it to select the best model for any given task.‚Äù\nThere was no new Amazon hardware announced at the event, though Amazon teased out that many of these features are coming to a new Alexa.com web experience alongside and an entirely new phone app.\nUnlike Alexa, the improved Alexa+ will cost you money: $20 per month. It's free if you have an Amazon Prime membership. Amazon says early access will begin to roll out next month in the US, beginning with the Echo Show 8, 10, 15, and 21. After that, the rollout will be in waves, but the new assistant should be accessible on nearly every Alexa-powered device Amazon has shipped.",

For this guide, I put these ovens through the paces, cooking veggies, fish, wings, whole chicken, and of course toast and bagels to see if the oven actually manages to brown bread.\nTo test the evenness of toasting and cooking, I spread bread across the width of the rack. While none attained 100 percent even toasting, our top picks were remarkably fair-minded in distributing brownness across the entire surface.\nI waited out the preheating time for each oven, and used a TempSpike Pro wireless meat thermometer to capture the evenness and accuracy of temperature, watching to see if an oven overshot its target and how much it fluctuated‚Äînot just over time but around the surface of each oven.\nI also assessed each oven's cooking capacity and its use of counter space compared to its utility, and worked my way around each oven to try out what makes it particularly wonderful, useful, or just plain interesting. If a display is too beepy or irritating, I also took note.\nI also assessed whether an oven is wonderfully easy or difficult to clean. Note: Most toaster ovens are a little difficult.\nDo I Want a Toaster or a Toaster Oven?\nWith very few exceptions, the best device for toasting is a toaster, if that's all you need it to do. Toaster ovens tend to do a whole lot more than toast and can handle a much broader array of foods.\nToasting is the process of very quickly and evenly heating and drying the exterior of a piece of bread at high temperature, leaving the exterior pleasantly browned and the interior perhaps less affected‚Äîideally maybe even still a little moist and chewy, if you're not charring the thing.\nA classic toaster (see our guide to the Best Toasters) is well situated to do this, because it essentially consists of a pair of resistive heating elements that get very hot, very close to the bread. When the element reaches a prescribed temperature‚Äîand thus maybe brownness‚Äîthe toast pops up. Most modern toasters also have a bagel setting that'll brown one side more than the other.\nThe toaster ovens in this buying guide can toast bread, but they can also handle far more complicated tasks, like slow-roasting a chicken, broiling a tuna melt, baking bread or pizza, air frying wings, or charring vegetables on a griddle plate.\nBut because the heating elements are likely farther away from the bread, and the ovens are larger, a toaster oven might toast differently and a little less quickly than a single-purpose toaster. Which is to say, it might bake your bread a little in the process of toasting it. That said, a toaster oven can also better accommodate breads of varying thickness, as well as toast with stuff on it. Do you like garlic bread? Then you probably like toaster ovens.\nAnd in fact, as it turned out, our favorite bread toaster among our toaster ovens can make simple dry toast that'll shame most toasters. The Japanese-designed Balmuda the Toaster uses steam to keep bread lively, even as it gently browns its exterior.\nOther Toaster Ovens We Liked\nAnova Precision Oven for $949: OK, OK, it's not a toaster oven. But this hefty Anova combi steam oven (8/10, Wired Recommends) is a powerful and versatile oven that can serve a role quite like the modern multifunction toaster oven‚Äîthough I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd heat up any oven this large for a couple slices of toast. WIRED reviewer Joe Ray was impressed by the steam oven‚Äôs ability to mimic sous-vide-style cooking in a large format, whether on poultry or seafood, alongside the usual gamut of baking and roasting. That said, while the original Precision Oven is still available, Anova has moved on to a new generation of the device we're still waiting to test.\nGourmia 9-Slice Digital Toaster Oven Air Fryer for $139: I was quite affectionate toward this Gourmia oven, from its handsome French doors to its line of colors that include a charming Easter egg green. The oven‚Äôs broad enough for a 13-inch pizza, it keeps temperature better than other Gourmia models I‚Äôve tested, and the $140 price tag is quite reasonable for an oven with such broad functionality. What kept it off the list as a budget pick was that the glass on those French doors gets quite hot while the oven is cooking‚Äîand if you open or shut one door with one hand, you‚Äôll send another hot door swinging the opposite way.\nNot Recommended\nInstant Pot Omni Toaster Oven 7-in-1 for $200: Unlike Instant‚Äôs basket air fryers, this oven model had a tough time keeping its temperature below raging-wildfire levels: The Omni overshot advertised temperatures by as much as 50 degrees.\nNinja Doublestack XL Countertop Oven for $350: The Doublestack is a large convection oven with a dedicated toaster plopped atop it, for fast bread browning. Alas, the heat bleeds badly between the two ovens, toast burns even at medium-low settings, and the temperature in the large oven is all over the place.\nBrava Smart Oven for $1,295: At about the price of an actual full-size oven and range, this Brava promises multi-zone cooking with the power of pure light. But contributing reviewer Joe Ray lamented the lack of flexibility in many recipes, and while basic foods came out well, it was hard to justify the price when other ovens will do the same or better for far less.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nScan the online brochures of companies who sell workplace monitoring tech and you‚Äôd think the average American worker was a renegade poised to take their employer down at the next opportunity. ‚ÄúNearly half of US employees admit to time theft!‚Äù ‚ÄúBiometric readers for enhanced accuracy!‚Äù ‚ÄúOffer staff benefits in a controlled way with Vending Machine Access!‚Äù\nA new wave of return-to-office mandates has arrived since the New Year, including at JP Morgan Chase, leading advertising agency WPP, and Amazon‚Äînot to mention President Trump‚Äôs late January directive to the heads of federal agencies to ‚Äúterminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in-person ‚Ä¶ on a full-time basis.‚Äù Five years on from the pandemic, when the world showed how effectively many roles could be performed remotely or flexibly, what‚Äôs caused the sudden change of heart?\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two things happening,‚Äù says global industry analyst Josh Bersin, who is based in California. ‚ÄúThe economy is actually slowing down, so companies are hiring less. So there is a trend toward productivity in general, and then AI has forced virtually every company to reallocate resources toward AI projects.\n‚ÄúThe expectation amongst CEOs is that‚Äôs going to eliminate a lot of jobs. A lot of these back-to-work mandates are due to frustration that both of those initiatives are hard to measure or hard to do when we don‚Äôt know what people are doing at home.‚Äù\nThe question is, what exactly are we returning to?\nTake any consumer tech buzzword of the 21st century and chances are it‚Äôs already being widely used across the US to monitor time, attendance and, in some cases, the productivity of workers, in sectors such as manufacturing, retail, and fast food chains: RFID badges, GPS time clock apps, NFC apps, QR code clocking-in, Apple Watch badges, and palm, face, eye, voice, and finger scanners. Biometric scanners have long been sold to companies as a way to avoid hourly workers ‚Äúbuddy punching‚Äù for each other at the start and end of shifts‚Äîso-called ‚Äútime theft.‚Äù A return-to-office mandate and its enforcement opens the door for similar scenarios for salaried staff.\nThe latest, deluxe end point of these time and attendance tchotchkes and apps is something like Austin-headquartered HID‚Äôs OmniKey platform. Designed for factories, hospitals, universities and offices, this is essentially an all-encompassing RFID log-in and security system for employees, via smart cards, smartphone wallets, and wearables. These provide access to turnstile entrances, exits, and floor access by way of elevators but also parking, the use of meeting rooms, the cafeteria, printers, lockers, and yes, vending machine access.\nTrack and Trace\nThese technologies, and more sophisticated worker location- and behavior-tracking systems, are expanding from blue-collar jobs to pink-collar industries and even white-collar office settings. Depending on the survey, approximately 70 to 80 percent of large US employers now use some form of employee monitoring, and the likes of PwC have explicitly told workers that managers will be tracking their location to enforce a three-day office week policy.\n‚ÄúSeveral of these earlier technologies, like RFID sensors and low-tech barcode scanners, have been used in manufacturing, in warehouses, or in other settings for some time,‚Äù says Wolfie Christl, a researcher of workplace surveillance for Cracked Labs, a nonprofit based in Vienna, Austria. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre moving toward the use of all kinds of sensor data, and this kind of technology is certainly now moving into the offices. However, I think for many of these, it‚Äôs questionable whether they really make sense there.‚Äù\nWhat‚Äôs new, at least to the recent pandemic age of hybrid working, is the extent to which workers can now be tracked inside office buildings. Cracked Labs published a frankly terrifying 25-page case study report in November 2024 showing how systems of wireless networking, motion sensors, and Bluetooth beacons, whether intentionally or as a byproduct of their capabilities, can provide ‚Äúbehavioral monitoring and profiling‚Äù in office settings.\nThe project breaks the tech down into two categories: The first is technology that tracks desk presence and room occupancy, and the second monitors the indoor location, movement, and behavior of the people working inside the building.\nTo start with desk and room occupancy, Spacewell offers a mix of motion sensors installed under desks, in ceilings, and at doorways in ‚Äúoffice spaces‚Äù and heat sensors and low-resolution visual sensors to show which desks and rooms are being used. Both real-time and trend data are available to managers via its ‚Äúlive data floorplan,‚Äù and the sensors also capture temperature, environmental, light intensity, and humidity data.\nThe Swiss-headquartered Locatee, meanwhile, uses existing badge and device data via Wi-Fi and LAN to continuously monitor clocking in and clocking out, time spent by workers at desks and on specific floors, and the number of hours and days spent by employees at the office per week. While the software displays aggregate rather than individual personal employee data to company executives, the Cracked Labs report points out that Locatee offers a segmented team analytics report which ‚Äúreveals data on small groups.‚Äù\nAs more companies return to the office, the interest in this idea of ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù working spaces is growing fast. According to S&S Insider‚Äôs early 2025 analysis, the connected office was worth $43 billion in 2023 and will grow to $122.5 billion by 2032. Alongside this, IndustryARC predicts there will be a $4.5 billion employee-monitoring-technology market, mostly in North America, by 2026‚Äîthe only issue being that the crossover between the two is blurry at best.\nAt the end of January, Logitech showed off its millimeter-wave radar Spot sensors, which are designed to allow employers to monitor whether rooms are being used and which rooms in the building are used the most. A Logitech rep told The Verge that the peel-and-stick devices, which also monitor VOCs, temperature, and humidity, could theoretically estimate the general placement of people in a meeting room.\nAs Christl explains, because of the functionality that these types of sensor-based systems offer, there is the very real possibility of a creep from legitimate applications, such as managing energy use, worker health and safety, and ensuring sufficient office resources into more intrusive purposes.\n‚ÄúFor me, the main issue is that if companies use highly sensitive data like tracking the location of employees‚Äô devices and smartphones indoors or even use motion detectors indoors,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúthen there must be totally reliable safeguards that this data is not being used for any other purposes.‚Äù\nBig Brother Is Watching\nThis warning becomes even more pressing where workers‚Äô indoor location, movement, and behavior are concerned. Cisco‚Äôs Spaces cloud platform has digitized 11 billion square feet of enterprise locations, producing 24.7 trillion location data points. The Spaces system is used by more than 8,800 businesses worldwide and is deployed by the likes of InterContinental Hotels Group, WeWork, the NHS Foundation, and San Jose State University, according to Cisco‚Äôs website.\nWhile it has applications for retailers, restaurants, hotels, and event venues, many of its features are designed to function in office environments, including meeting room management and occupancy monitoring. Spaces is designed as a comprehensive, all-seeing eye into how employees (and customers and visitors, depending on the setting) and their connected devices, equipment, or ‚Äúassets‚Äù move through physical spaces.\nCisco has achieved this by using its existing wireless infrastructure and combining data from Wi-Fi access points with Bluetooth tracking. Spaces offers employers both real-time views and historical data dashboards. The use cases? Everything from meeting-room scheduling and optimizing cleaning schedules to more invasive dashboards on employees‚Äô entry and exit times, the duration of staff workdays, visit durations by floor, and other ‚Äúbehavior metrics.‚Äù This includes those related to performance, a feature pitched at manufacturing sites.\nSome of these analytics use aggregate data, but Cracked Labs details how Spaces goes beyond this into personal data, with device usernames and identifiers that make it possible to single out individuals. While the ability to protect privacy by using MAC randomization is there, Cisco emphasizes that this makes indoor movement analytics ‚Äúunreliable‚Äù and other applications impossible‚Äîleaving companies to make that decision themselves.\nManagement even has the ability to send employees nudge-style alerts based on their location in the building. An IBM application, based on Cisco‚Äôs underlying technology, offers to spot anomalies in occupancy patterns and send notifications to workers or their managers based on what it finds. Cisco‚Äôs Spaces can also incorporate video footage from Cisco security cameras and WebEx video conferencing hardware into the overall system of indoor movement monitoring; another example of function creep from security to employee tracking in the workplace.\nCisco told WIRED that Spaces ‚Äúenhances workplace efficiency and employee experience‚Äù and that it had been ‚Äúbuilt and engineered with privacy by design and industry-standard security measures.‚Äù But Christl has concerns about the amount of data that Spaces gives employers access to.\n‚ÄúCisco is simply everywhere. As soon as employers start to repurpose data that is being collected from networking or IT infrastructure, this quickly becomes very dangerous, from my perspective,‚Äù he says.\n‚ÄúWith this kind of indoor location tracking technology based on its Wi-Fi networks, I think that a vendor as major as Cisco has a responsibility to ensure it doesn‚Äôt suggest or market solutions that are really irresponsible to employers.\n‚ÄúI would consider any productivity and performance tracking very problematic when based on this kind of intrusive behavioral data.‚Äù\nCisco isn't alone in this, though. Similar to Spaces, Juniper‚Äôs Mist offers an indoor tracking system that uses both Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth beacons to locate people, connected devices, and Bluetooth tagged badges on a real-time map, with the option of up to 13 months of historical data on worker behavior.\nJuniper‚Äôs offering, for workplaces including offices, hospitals, manufacturing sites, and retailers, is so precise that it is able to provide records of employees‚Äô device names, together with the exact enter and exit times and duration of visits between ‚Äúzones‚Äù in offices‚Äîincluding one labeled ‚Äúbreak area/kitchen‚Äù in a demo. Yikes.\nFor each of these systems, a range of different applications is functionally possible, and some which raise labor-law concerns. ‚ÄúA worst-case scenario would be that management wants to fire someone and then starts looking into historical records trying to find some misconduct,‚Äù says Christl. \"If it‚Äôs necessary to investigate employees, then there should be a procedure where, for example, a worker representative is looking into the fine-grained behavioral data together with management. This would be another safeguard to prevent misuse.‚Äù\nAbove and Beyond?\nIf warehouse-style tracking has the potential for management overkill in office settings, it makes even less sense in service and health care jobs, and American unions are now pushing for more access to data and quotas used in disciplinary action. Elizabeth Anderson, professor of public philosophy at the University of Michigan and the author of Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives, describes how black-box algorithm-driven management and monitoring affects not just the day-to-day of nursing staff but also their sense of work and value.\n‚ÄúSurveillance and this idea of time theft, it‚Äôs all connected to this idea of wasting time,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúEssentially all relational work is considered inefficient. In a memory care unit, for example, the system will say how long to give a patient breakfast, how many minutes to get them dressed, and so forth.\n‚ÄúMaybe an Alzheimer‚Äôs patient is frightened, so a nurse has to spend some time calming them down, or perhaps they have lost some ability overnight. That‚Äôs not one of the discrete physical tasks that can be measured. Most of the job is helping that person cope with declining faculties; it takes time for that, for people to read your emotions and respond appropriately. What you get is massive moral injury with this notion of efficiency.‚Äù\nThis kind of monitoring extends to service workers, including servers in restaurants and cleaning staff, according to a 2023 Cracked Labs‚Äô report into retail and hospitality. Software developed by Oracle is used to, among other applications, rate and rank servers based on speed, sales, timekeeping around breaks, and how many tips they receive. Similar Oracle software that monitors mobile workers such as housekeepers and cleaners in hotels uses a timer for app-based micromanagement‚Äîfor instance, ‚Äúyou have two minutes for this room, and there are four tasks.‚Äù\nAs Christl explains, this simply doesn‚Äôt work in practice. ‚ÄúPeople have to struggle to combine what they really do with this kind of rigid, digital system. And it‚Äôs not easy to standardize work like talking to patients and other kinds of affective work, like how friendly you are as a waiter. This is a major problem. These systems cannot represent the work that is being done accurately.‚Äù\nBut can knowledge work done in offices ever be effectively measured and assessed either? In an episode of his podcast in January, host Ezra Klein battled his own feelings about having many of his best creative ideas at a caf√© down the street from where he lives rather than in The New York Times‚Äô Manhattan offices. Anderson agrees that creativity often has to find its own path.\n‚ÄúSay there‚Äôs a webcam tracking your eyes to make sure you‚Äôre looking at the screen,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe know that daydreaming a little can actually help people come up with creative ideas. Just letting your mind wander is incredibly useful for productivity overall, but that requires some time looking around or out the window. The software connected to your camera is saying you‚Äôre off-duty‚Äîthat you‚Äôre wasting time. Nobody‚Äôs mind can keep concentrated for the whole work day, but you don‚Äôt even want that from a productivity point of view.‚Äù\nEven for roles where it might make more methodological sense to track discrete physical tasks, there can be negative consequences of nonstop monitoring. Anderson points to a scene in Erik Gandini‚Äôs 2023 documentary After Work that shows an Amazon delivery driver who is monitored, via camera, for their driving, delivery quotas, and even getting dinged for using Spotify in the van.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very tightly regulated and super, super intrusive, and it‚Äôs all based on distrust as the starting point,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhat these tech bros don‚Äôt understand is that if you install surveillance technology, which is all about distrusting the workers, there is a deep feature of human psychology that is reciprocity. If you don‚Äôt trust me, I‚Äôm not going to trust you. You think an employee who doesn‚Äôt trust the boss is going to be working with the same enthusiasm? I don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù\nTrust Issues\nThe fixes, then, might be in the leadership itself, not more data dashboards. ‚ÄúOur research shows that excessive monitoring in the workplace can damage trust, have a negative impact on morale, and cause stress and anxiety,‚Äù says Hayfa Mohdzaini, senior policy and practice adviser for technology at the CIPD, the UK‚Äôs professional body for HR, learning, and development. ‚ÄúEmployers might achieve better productivity by investing in line manager training and ensuring employees feel supported with reasonable expectations around office attendance and manageable workloads.‚Äù\nA 2023 Pew Research study found that 56 percent of US workers were opposed to the use of AI to keep track of when employees were at their desks, and 61 percent were against tracking employees‚Äô movements while they work.\nThis dropped to just 51 percent of workers who were opposed to recording work done on company computers, through the use of a kind of corporate ‚Äúspyware‚Äù often accepted by staff in the private sector. As Josh Bersin puts it, ‚ÄúYes, the company can read your emails‚Äù with platforms such as Teramind, even including ‚Äúsentiment analysis‚Äù of employee messages.\nSnooping on files, emails, and digital chats takes on new significance when it comes to government workers, though. New reporting from WIRED, based on conversations with employees at 13 federal agencies, reveals the extent to Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE team‚Äôs surveillance: software including Google‚Äôs Gemini AI chatbot, a Dynatrace extension, and security tool Splunk have been added to government computers in recent weeks, and some people have felt they can‚Äôt speak freely on recorded and transcribed Microsoft Teams calls. Various agencies already use Everfox software and Dtex‚Äôs Intercept system, which generates individual risk scores for workers based on websites and files accessed.\nAlongside mass layoffs and furloughs over the past four weeks, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has also, according to CBS News and NPR reports, gone into multiple agencies in February with the theater and bombast of full X-ray security screenings replacing entry badges at Washington, DC, headquarters. That‚Äôs alongside managers telling staff that their logging in and out of devices, swiping in and out of workspaces, and all of their digital work chats will be ‚Äúclosely monitored‚Äù going forward.\n‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôre trying to make a big deal out of it to scare people right now,‚Äù says Bersin. ‚ÄúThe federal government is using back-to-work as an excuse to lay off a bunch of people.‚Äù\nDOGE staff have reportedly even added keylogger software to government computers to track everything employees type, with staff concerned that anyone using keywords related to progressive thinking or \"disloyalty‚Äù to Trump could be targeted‚Äînot to mention the security risks it introduces for those working on sensitive projects. As one worker told NPR, it feels ‚ÄúSoviet-style‚Äù and ‚ÄúOrwellian‚Äù with ‚Äúnonstop monitoring.‚Äù Anderson describes the overall DOGE playbook as a series of ‚Äúdeeply intrusive invasions of privacy.‚Äù\nAlternate Realities\nBut what protections are out there for employees? Certain states, such as New York and Illinois, do offer strong privacy protections against, for example, unnecessary biometric tracking in the private sector, and California‚Äôs Consumer Privacy Act covers workers as well as consumers. Overall, though, the lack of federal-level labor law in this area makes the US something of an alternate reality to what is legal in the UK and Europe.\nThe Electronic Communications Privacy Act in the US allows employee monitoring for legitimate business reasons and with the worker‚Äôs consent. In Europe, Algorithm Watch has made country analyses for workplace surveillance in the UK, Italy, Sweden, and Poland. To take one high-profile example of the stark difference: In early 2024, Serco was ordered by the UK's privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office (ICO), to stop using face recognition and fingerprint scanning systems, designed by Shopworks, to track the time and attendance of 2,000 staff across 38 leisure centers around the country. This new guidance led to more companies reviewing or cutting the technology altogether, including Virgin Active, which pulled similar biometric employee monitoring systems from 30-plus sites.\nDespite a lack of comprehensive privacy rights in the US, though, worker protest, union organizing, and media coverage can provide a firewall against some office surveillance schemes. Unions such as the Service Employees International Union are pushing for laws to protect workers from black-box algorithms dictating the pace of output.\nIn December, Boeing scrapped a pilot of employee monitoring at offices in Missouri and Washington, which was based on a system of infrared motion sensors and VuSensor cameras installed in ceilings, made by Ohio-based Avuity. The U-turn came after a Boeing employee leaked an internal PowerPoint presentation on the occupancy- and headcount-tracking technology to The Seattle Times. In a matter of weeks, Boeing confirmed that managers would remove all the sensors that had been installed to date.\nUnder-desk sensors, in particular, have received high-profile backlash, perhaps because they are such an obvious piece of surveillance hardware rather than simply software designed to record work done on company machines. In the fall of 2022, students at Northeastern University hacked and removed under-desk sensors produced by EnOcean, offering ‚Äúpresence detection‚Äù and ‚Äúpeople counting,‚Äù that had been installed in the school‚Äôs Interdisciplinary Science & Engineering Complex. The university provost eventually informed students that the department had planned to use the sensors with the Spaceti platform to optimize desk usage.\nOccupEye (now owned by FM: Systems), another type of under-desk heat and motion sensor, received a similar reaction from staff at Barclays Bank and The Telegraph newspaper in London, with employees protesting and, in some cases, physically removing the devices that tracked the time they spent away from their desks.\nDespite the fallout, Barclays later faced a $1.1 billion fine from the ICO when it was found to have deployed Sapience‚Äôs employee monitoring software in its offices, with the ability to single out and track individual employees. Perhaps unsurprisingly in the current climate, that same software company now offers ‚Äúlightweight device-level technology‚Äù to monitor return-to-office policy compliance, with a dashboard breaking employee location down by office versus remote for specific departments and teams.\nAccording to Elizabeth Anderson‚Äôs latest book Hijacked, while workplace surveillance culture and the obsession with measuring employee efficiency might feel relatively new, it can actually be traced back to the invention of the ‚Äúwork ethic‚Äù by the Puritans in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n‚ÄúThey thought you should be working super hard; you shouldn‚Äôt be idling around when you should be in work,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou can see some elements there that can be developed into a pretty hostile stance toward workers. The Puritans were obsessed with not wasting time. It was about gaining assurance of salvation through your behavior. With the Industrial Revolution, the ‚Äòno wasting time‚Äô became a profit-maximizing strategy. Now you‚Äôre at work 24/7 because they can get you on email.‚Äù\nSome key components of the original work ethic, though, have been skewed or lost over time. The Puritans also had strict constraints on what duties employers had toward their workers: paying a living wage and providing safe and healthy working conditions.\n‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt just rule them tyrannically, or so they said. You had to treat them as your fellow Christians, with dignity and respect. In many ways the original work ethic was an ethic which uplifted workers.‚Äù",

Biometric scanners have long been sold to companies as a way to avoid hourly workers ‚Äúbuddy punching‚Äù for each other at the start and end of shifts‚Äîso-called ‚Äútime theft.‚Äù A return-to-office mandate and its enforcement opens the door for similar scenarios for salaried staff.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The latest, deluxe end point of these time and attendance tchotchkes and apps is something like Austin-headquartered <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://chooseyouromnikey.com/office.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://chooseyouromnikey.com/office.html\" href=\"https://chooseyouromnikey.com/office.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">HID‚Äôs OmniKey platform</a>.

So you start to see that just by existing and being different, you are showing what‚Äôs possible.‚Äù</p><p class=\"paywall\">For Zenla, Long, and cofounder Ariadne Conill, who has an extensive background in open source software and security, the goal of developing Edera's container isolation technology is to make it easy (at least relatively speaking) for network engineers and IT managers to implement robust guardrails and separation across their systems so an exploited vulnerability in one piece of network equipment or a rogue insider situation won't‚Äîand can't‚Äîspiral into a disastrous mega-breach.</p><p class=\"paywall\">‚ÄúPeople have legacy applications in their infrastructure and use end-of-life software; there‚Äôs no way to do security and believe that you can always patch every existing vulnerability,‚Äù Long says. ‚ÄúBut it inherently creates a pretty large risk profile. And then on top of that, containers were never originally designed to be isolated from each other, so you had to choose between innovation and performance and security, and we don‚Äôt want people to have that trade-off anymore.‚Äù</p></div></div></body></html>",

Until now, there was no reason to imagine that a small cluster like the Large Magellanic Cloud could host one. When x-ray telescopes or observatories have been trained on smaller clusters like the Large Magellanic Cloud, they have found no signatures associated with black hole activity.\nBut then came the hypervelocity stars. For nearly 20 years, astronomers have spotted fast-traveling stars with enough acceleration to be ejected from their own galaxies. While a traditional star moves at about 100 kilometers per second, a hypervelocity star travels up to 10 times faster. Experts think such stars appear by being ‚Äúcatapulted outward‚Äù by a supermassive gravitational structure under the Hills mechanism‚Äîwhich is where a binary star system interacts with a black hole, with one star captured by the black hole and the other flung away from it.\nWithin the Milky Way itself there are hypervelocity stars that probably originated here. Studies suggest they were accelerated by Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. But at least 21 hypervelocity stars detected are consistent with being ejected by a supermassive black hole but cannot be linked to the intrinsic activity of the Milky Way. In the team‚Äôs simulations, it‚Äôs plausible that these stars are instead originating from the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nFor the team, led by Jiwon Jesse Han, this is one of the first major pieces of evidence for the presence of a supermassive black hole in our neighboring dwarf galaxy. According to the team‚Äôs initial calculations, this black hole structure could be between 251,000 and 1 million solar masses.

    "content_text": "Monica Retamosa was in the middle of changing the batteries of a tape recorder when she heard a bellbird for the first time. Standing on a forest floor, she looked up into the trees, scanning for the source of its metallic and powerful sound, searching for the bird for half an hour to no avail. The bellbird sings from the treetops where it is visible to its peers but invisible to those below. Still, Retamosa smiled: She cares for ecosystems in Costa Rica‚Äôs AmistOsa Biological Corridor by listening to them.\nIn nature, living things use sound for almost everything. They make calls to attract mates, communicate identities, warn of dangers, guide the way, and help in hunting or defense. For decades, researchers have tracked species with recorders in hand, and still do, though increasingly are using remote recording devices too. The study of the sounds organisms make is known as bioacoustics. Retamosa has been doing this work for 10 years.\nUsing bioacoustic recordings, studies have shown that some birds shout loudly to make themselves heard in cities and that sea turtle hatchlings communicate from the nest to coordinate their hatching. And when bioacoustics is combined with other sounds‚Äîthose made by humans, as well as the natural sounds of the landscape, such as the crashing of waves in the sea‚Äîit is possible to interpret deeper ecological meaning. It becomes possible to monitor changes in biodiversity, detect threats, and measure the effectiveness of conservation strategies. This wider analysis of sound is known as ecoacoustics‚Äîand it is exactly the work underway here in Costa Rica.\nRetamosa has been working for 20 years at the National University of Costa Rica, at the International Institute for Conservation and Wildlife Management. She uses bioacoustics and ecoacoustics to investigate the sounds of this small Central American country that hosts more than half a million species.\n‚ÄúSounds have been forgotten from a conservation point of view,‚Äù Retamosa says. ‚ÄúMost of the time, we hear more than we see. It‚Äôs likely that when a disturbance occurs in the system, we can detect it sooner by a sound, or lack thereof, than by other factors.‚Äù\nThe development of automated recordings revolutionized bioacoustics and ecoacoustics. Now, research groups can hang sensors that record snippets of the day for months at a time without interfering with wildlife. Retamosa likes this strategy because it‚Äôs non-invasive to animals, makes it easier to have ears in large areas and hard-to-reach places, and occasionally helps discover mysterious species.\nAlthough she prefers to monitor ecosystems from a distance, Retamosa still has to go deep into the forest to set up recorders. Visits to the field are fascinating, but never a Sunday stroll. She has hiked miles through mud and branches, along with her colleagues Jimmy Barrantes and Randall Jim√©nez. They have gone up and down endless slopes. Once, she fell and fractured her ribs. But the work doesn‚Äôt end with the installation: they have to go back to change batteries and memory cards. In other countries, they use solar panels and the internet to receive real-time data; in the dark, humid rainforests of Costa Rica, it‚Äôs still done by hand.\nThat‚Äôs what Retamosa was doing when she heard the bellbird. That recording forms part of a project to track the movement and distribution of these birds, which migrate between different altitudes in the region. Their presence could be a functional indicator of the state of the AmistOsa Biological Corridor, which connects La Amistad International Park, on the border with Panama, with other reserves in southern Costa Rica.\nThe biological corridor was shaped by the passage of wildlife that emerged following the 1990 Forestry Law, which protected wilderness areas and encouraged reforestation on farms through payments for environmental services. In 2010, it was officially mapped. Today it runs through indigenous territories and crosses the country‚Äôs largest wetland. Across the Costa Rica there are now 53 corridors, covering 38 percent of its territory.\nThe project data will help the committee in charge of Costa Rica‚Äôs biodiversity and natural resources make decisions. ‚ÄúThe idea is to make a monitoring protocol, linking the government, the communities, and us as academia, providing support for analysis and interpretation,‚Äù Retamosa says.\nRecorders hung in the wild capture many terabytes of data, so listening to every recording is not feasible. With an eye toward making it a cost-efficient strategy, researchers have developed acoustic indices: mathematical formulas that interpret ecosystem traits from the recorded sounds. ‚ÄúThey can reflect the acoustic energy of a place, activity, or frequency diversity,‚Äù Retamosa explains. When she started in this field, there were only eight acoustic indices. Now there are more than 80.\nThe discipline is advancing so rapidly that the scope of these indices is currently being debated. In some of her early research, Retamosa found that certain acoustic measurements show variations between tropical and temperate regions. One of the best known, acoustic complexity‚Äîthe degree of variation and intricate structure of bioacoustic sound‚Äîhas been used as a descriptor of bird diversity in temperate environments. However, in tropical areas, different investigations have shown that it does not reflect species diversity, but rather the level of acoustic activity; that is, instead of indicating the presence of multiple species, it seems to show the intense vocalization of one or a few birds.\nCareful analysis of these indices can be used to reveal the health of the forest. In a report with Jimmy Barrantes, Retamosa outlines that measuring acoustic entropy‚Äîthe variation of sound intensity across time and audio frequencies‚Äîand acoustic diversity helped them to classify the state of disturbance of some sites, while those of acoustic activity and energy did not. ‚ÄúYou can use the indices for a first exploration of the site, to do studies over time, looking for specific changes associated with human disturbances and work with key species,‚Äù she explains.\nListening for the Impacts of Tourism\nEvery region has its own environmental concerns. In Costa Rica, tourism has grown dramatically: between 1984 and 1989, international arrivals increased 37 percent, from 273,900 to 375,900 visitors. But since 1990, the pace has skyrocketed: last year the country received 2.6 million tourists.\nThis boom poses sustainability challenges. To address them, the International Institute for Conservation and Wildlife Management team analyzes sounds inside and outside protected areas. One of its tools is an index that measures the ratio between biological sounds and human-made noises.\nIn recent years, automated acoustic detection, using artificial intelligence and machine learning, has revolutionized species identification. Previously, advanced programming skills were required to use AI, but with the advent of accessible interface models, it‚Äôs becoming more popular. Exoacoustics is increasingly focused on developing more accurate models for classifying sounds.\nAnd it‚Äôs becoming possible to pick out individual species in the soundscape using these tools. In a study of farms conducted as part of the Bosque Vivo project, run by Costa Rica‚Äôs National Forest Financing Fund, the research team found that Hylopezus perspicillatus, a bird species sensitive to landscape disturbance, was only present in the control sites of Corcovado National Park and in the forests of the best-conserved farms.\nIn Guanacaste, Retamosa is also working on a long-term monitoring protocol to evaluate how ecosystems and biodiversity are responding to climate variability. In other countries, similar projects are recording sound baselines in sites with minimal human intervention that, in the future, could be compared with up-to-date recordings to detect changes. Although storing all these records is costly, Retamosa believes that they‚Äôll form an invaluable historical archive, which one day can be returned to when technology allows further analysis.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Espa√±ol and has been translated from Spanish.",

Don‚Äôt buy one. It‚Äôs not that Wi-Fi extenders don‚Äôt work but that they don‚Äôt work well. There are many more-effective ways to improve your Wi-Fi, and I‚Äôll dig into a few later on, but first I want to explain the issues I have with extenders‚Äîalso sometimes called Wi-Fi range boosters or repeaters.\nIf you still want to try one, I have a few options for you to consider.

Subscribe Today.\nThe Trouble With Wi-Fi Extenders\nAs the name suggests, Wi-Fi extenders pick up the Wi-Fi signal from your router and extend it. They use the same frequency band as your main router and repeat the signal. They are designed to boost signal strength in the immediate area but will not increase speed. In fact, they will reduce it. Here's what I've come across in my testing:\nSlower speeds: The theoretical maximum speed an extender can provide is 50 percent of the speed you get from your main router, because it connects to your router via Wi-Fi (backhaul) and broadcasts its own separate network for devices. Realistically, the speed you get from an extender will always be lower than 50 percent, depending on various factors such as distance, interference, and obstacles.\nLatency increase: The drop in speed from the extender may be manageable if you have a fast enough network to begin with, but Wi-Fi extenders also increase latency. If you are playing an online game or having a video call, this increased latency can be disastrous, potentially causing lag and glitches. This was a recurring problem in my tests.\nCongestion: Wi-Fi extenders can cause congestion and interfere with your main network, and there is no seamless hand-off for your devices as you move around the house, because they will decide when to switch between networks unless you switch manually. Because the signal strength of the Wi-Fi extender doesn‚Äôt reflect its speed, it can be tricky to know when to switch. What appears to be a weaker signal from the main router may still be faster than a strong signal from the extender.\nSmart home issues: Traditionally, Wi-Fi extenders take the signal from your router and rebroadcast it under a different network name (SSID). The default is usually to add _EXT to the end. This means you need to connect devices to the extender separately. Some newer extenders, often described as ‚Äúmesh ready,‚Äù can connect to your main router and rebroadcast under the same network name. Because Wi-Fi extenders connect to your router via Wi-Fi just like any other device and create a separate network, devices that connect to it are no longer connected directly to your main router. This can cause all sorts of issues. Some smart-home controls and devices require your phone to be on the same network as the device it is trying to control. If the extender assigns MAC addresses virtually for connected devices, expect issues with many smart-home devices not being recognized‚Äîfeatures like parental controls and MAC filtering won't work.\nDifficult placement: Most Wi-Fi extenders are designed to plug directly into an outlet, but this severely limits where you can place them, making it tough to get the best performance. They are also often bulky enough to block adjacent outlets.\nPrice problems: Cheap Wi-Fi extenders perform very poorly and are impossible to recommend, but good Wi-Fi extenders are too expensive compared to increasingly affordable routers and mesh systems.\nWi-Fi Extender Alternatives\nThere are many alternatives to a Wi-Fi extender, but keeping it brief, these are my top recommendations:\nMove your router: Seriously, try this before you buy anything. Routers pump out Wi-Fi in a rough circle, so the ideal place for your router is in the middle of your home, and higher up is better. If you can run a cable and move your router from the edge of your home into the middle, you can expect a big improvement. Even if you can‚Äôt move your router far, consider elevating it, changing its position, and fiddling with the antennas (if it has any). Do not shut your router away in a closet or drawer. A quick way to test the difference is to type ‚Äúspeed test‚Äù into the browser on your phone and run it before and after any changes in the location you are having issues with.\nUse Ethernet cables: The best way to get fast internet everywhere is to run Ethernet cables around your home, but this can be invasive and likely won't work as a solution for renters. Ethernet cables plugged into your main router will get you as close as possible to your fastest internet speed (the speed your ISP delivers). You can reconfigure old routers and Wi-Fi extenders as additional access points in other parts of your home if you can run Ethernet cables to them. Mesh systems also work best with a wired backhaul.\nBuy a new router: If you are using the router that your ISP supplied or an old router (Wi-Fi 5 or older), it might be time to consider an upgrade. Our router buying guide can help you decide what will work best for you, and there are several solid options for different budgets in our Best Wi-Fi Routers guide. It's better to spend $100 on a new router than on a Wi-Fi extender for an old or poor-quality router.\nBuy a mesh: You will likely need to spend a bit more, but mesh systems are becoming more affordable. They offer a main router and one or more nodes or satellites to place around your home. They are very easy to set up and you can always add more nodes later. Mesh systems are smarter than extenders, creating a single optimized network throughout your home that passes off connections efficiently as you move around. While there is a speed drop between the main router and nodes (unless you connect them via Ethernet cable), it is far smaller than with extenders. There are several options in our Best Mesh Wi-Fi Routers guide.\nWhen to Use a Wi-Fi Extender\nThe one scenario where you might be best buying a Wi-Fi extender is when you have a specific dead spot in your home where you want to improve download speeds. For example, the TV in the back room keeps buffering when you are trying to watch Netflix. I don‚Äôt recommend using Wi-Fi extenders where upload speeds and latency are important, such as for online gaming or video calls.\nIt‚Äôs important to match the features of your router with your Wi-Fi extender to get the most from it. If you have a dual-band Wi-Fi 6 router, for example, get a dual-band Wi-Fi 6 extender. For easy setup and configuration, wherever possible, opt for an extender that is the same brand as your router. Some extenders offer mesh-like capabilities when paired with the right routers (though proper mesh systems always perform better).\nIf your extender has an Ethernet port and access point mode, it offers more options and may still prove useful if you move homes or change your setup. That said, the more features and the better the performance, the higher the price.\nI have tested the following devices, and they are probably the best Wi-Fi extenders if you‚Äôre determined to buy one:\n- Netgear EAX15 for $100: This dual-band Wi-Fi 6 extender was easy to set up and uses your existing network name. It has a Gigabit Ethernet port and supports access point mode. It offered strong performance on the 5-GHz band at relatively close range, making it perfect for a problem dead spot or room.\n- Linksys RE7310 for $100: Folks with a Linksys router should consider this bulky dual-band Wi-Fi 6 extender. It also uses your existing network details, though it lacks an Ethernet port. It offers decent range and speeds for an extender.\n- TP-Link RE715X for $120: Top of the test table, this dual-band Wi-Fi 6 extender was the fastest at close range on the 5-GHz band and had the best range. It also has a Gigabit Ethernet port, supports access point mode, and can form a mesh with any other OneMesh TP-Link router. Note: the US government is investigating TP-Link and considering a router ban after its devices were targeted in cyberattacks linked to the Chinese government.\nBefore you bite on any of these extenders, the Asus RT-AX57 Go is my favorite travel router, and it costs $100. It has both a repeater mode and access point mode, and it supports AiMesh, enabling you to create a mesh if you have an Asus router. You can also use it on the go to secure public Wi-Fi, tether a 4G or 5G mobile hot spot or phone, or plug into an office or hotel internet connection via Ethernet. It is a far more versatile option than a standard extender.\nIf you opt for a Wi-Fi extender, think carefully about placement. It's crucial that your extender is not just within range of your main router but has a strong signal to repeat. If you place it on the edge of your current Wi-Fi network you won‚Äôt get good speeds. Rather than the back room you are trying to improve, consider the hallway outside, closer to your main router but not too close (perhaps halfway between), for best results. You can always test different locations to find the sweet spot. And if the extender has antennas, try moving them around to get the best signal.",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Difficult placement:</strong> Most Wi-Fi extenders are designed to plug directly into an outlet, but this severely limits where you can place them, making it tough to get the best performance. They are also often bulky enough to block adjacent outlets.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Price problems:</strong> Cheap Wi-Fi extenders perform very poorly and are impossible to recommend, but good Wi-Fi extenders are too expensive compared to increasingly affordable routers and mesh systems.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Wi-Fi Extender Alternatives</h2><p class=\"paywall\">There are many alternatives to a Wi-Fi extender, but keeping it brief, these are my top recommendations:</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Move your router</strong>: Seriously, try this before you buy anything. Routers pump out Wi-Fi in a rough circle, so the ideal place for your router is in the middle of your home, and higher up is better. If you can run a cable and move your router from the edge of your home into the middle, you can expect a big improvement. Even if you can‚Äôt move your router far, consider elevating it, changing its position, and fiddling with the antennas (if it has any). Do not shut your router away in a closet or drawer. A quick way to test the difference is to type ‚Äúspeed test‚Äù into the browser on your phone and run it before and after any changes in the location you are having issues with.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Use Ethernet cables</strong>: The best way to get fast internet everywhere is to run <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-ethernet/\">Ethernet cables</a> around your home, but this can be invasive and likely won't work as a solution for renters. Ethernet cables plugged into your main router will get you as close as possible to your fastest internet speed (the speed your ISP delivers). You can reconfigure old routers and Wi-Fi extenders as additional access points in other parts of your home if you can run Ethernet cables to them. Mesh systems also work best with a wired backhaul.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Buy a new router</strong>: If you are using the router that your ISP supplied or an old router (Wi-Fi 5 or older), it might be time to consider an upgrade. Our <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-buy-a-router/\">router buying guide</a> can help you decide what will work best for you, and there are several solid options for different budgets in our <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-wifi-routers/\">Best Wi-Fi Routers</a> guide. It's better to spend $100 on a new router than on a Wi-Fi extender for an old or poor-quality router.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Buy a mesh</strong>: You will likely need to spend a bit more, but mesh systems are becoming more affordable. They offer a main router and one or more nodes or satellites to place around your home. They are very easy to set up and you can always add more nodes later. Mesh systems are smarter than extenders, creating a single optimized network throughout your home that passes off connections efficiently as you move around. While there is a speed drop between the main router and nodes (unless you connect them via Ethernet cable), it is far smaller than with extenders. There are several options in our <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-mesh-wifi-routers/\">Best Mesh Wi-Fi Routers</a> guide.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">When to Use a Wi-Fi Extender</h2><p class=\"paywall\">The one scenario where you might be best buying a Wi-Fi extender is when you have a specific dead spot in your home where you want to improve download speeds. For example, the TV in the back room keeps buffering when you are trying to watch Netflix. I don‚Äôt recommend using Wi-Fi extenders where upload speeds and latency are important, such as for online gaming or video calls.</p><p aria-level=\"3\" class=\"paywall heading-h3\" role=\"heading\">How to Choose a Wi-Fi Extender</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>Netgear EAX15</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Simon Hill</span></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">It‚Äôs important to match the features of your router with your Wi-Fi extender to get the most from it.

    "content_text": "Follow the 10-inch pipeline that stretches south from Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul International Airport, and after 13 miles you'll find yourself at a potentially major future hub for sustainable aviation fuel in the upper Midwest.\nIn a deal announced in September, the Koch Industries-owned Pine Bend Refinery in Rosemount, Minnesota, would receive sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)‚Äîfuel made using nonpetroleum feedstocks, like renewable materials or waste‚Äîblend it into its conventional jet fuel, and send the fuel mix through the pipeline to the airport, where it will be used by Delta Airlines and other carriers.\nThe proponents of the project, including its financial backers Deloitte and Bank of America, said last year that up to 60 million gallons of blended fuel, containing potentially up to 50 percent SAF, would be flowing by 2025, and they aim to produce 1 billion gallons of SAF per year, which would surpass the demand at the Minneapolis airport and make the hub a producer for additional airports around the country and potentially the world. (There is no time frame for the refinery to hit this larger target.)\nBut this project‚Äîand others like it‚Äîdepends on financial-support frameworks like tax credits or loans that were set out under the Biden administration‚Äôs signature 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and which now may be taken away.\nLate last month, Montana Renewables, one of only a few US SAF producers‚Äîand the planned provider of the first batches for the Minnesota hub‚Äîsaid that the first $782 million tranche of a $1.67 billion loan from the Department of Energy was undergoing a ‚Äútactical delay to confirm alignment with White House priorities.‚Äù (US senator Steve Daines of Montana said on February 11 that the funding, which is factored into finance the project, has since been unfrozen.)\nFederal incentives like this are ‚Äúon life support‚Äù under the Trump administration, says Scott Irwin, a professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois. According to Irwin, the Trump administration has so far shown it is willing to completely dismantle the Inflation Reduction Act and its funding, even if it means clawing back promises to farmers and businesses that have already begun implementing climate-smart work.\nWhile state incentive programs along with low-carbon fuel standards still support SAF production, Irwin does not see who could step in to replace the federal government in the credit stack if the funding is withdrawn. ‚ÄúWithout the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, SAF is dead in the water,‚Äù he says.\nThe Refinery Math Already Didn‚Äôt Add Up\nLate last year WIRED spoke to Jake Reint, vice president of external affairs for Flint Hills Resources, the company within Koch Industries that owns Pine Bend and several other refineries, petrochemical plants, and pipelines. (Flint Hills is the company that struck the deal with Delta and other corporate partners to use the blended fuel from Pine Bend.) Even before Donald Trump was reelected, Reint articulated the challenges of ramping up the SAF industry.\nUnder the plan, Pine Bend will offload the SAF produced elsewhere from trucks operated by Shell, the distributor in the arrangement, and then blend it with its existing jet fuel mix. This will require Pine Bend to order specialty pumps that Reint says won‚Äôt be delivered for a year‚Äîand they can‚Äôt be ordered until a thorough planning process is completed, including precise estimates for short-term demand.\nOne also has to factor in the possibility that something could go wrong with the project implementation, Reint says, ‚Äúbecause we‚Äôre in phase zero.‚Äù\nHe added that the refinery would initially be blending in only small amounts of SAF‚Äî‚ÄúWe might sprinkle it in at 10 percent,‚Äù he says‚Äîand expressed a bearish view on producing a commodity that‚Äôs far more expensive than conventional jet fuel. ‚ÄúWe will do our part in the supply chain,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut we‚Äôre going to be an honest broker.‚Äù\nIn an email in February, Reint said the refinery is still making progress on the blending facility and expects to have the initial phase online later this year or in early 2026.\nBuilding and operating a refinery is a notoriously difficult business, and to reach its stated goal of 1 billion gallons per year, the Minnesota hub will need to incorporate several new production facilities making SAF from new feedstocks. Meanwhile, the SAF and wider clean fuels industries were hit with some major failures involving marquee investors in 2024‚Äîthe Fulcrum Bioenergy bankruptcy, for example‚Äîleading many to take an even more cautious approach to the sector.\nThe US Could Fall Behind in the SAF Race\nThe uncertainty caused by Trump means that investment fund Kerogen Capital is looking to make SAF development investments in Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Middle East. But Mark Chen, Kerogen‚Äôs chief operating officer, believes the demand from airlines for SAF is so great that it could be enough to get the market off the ground, no matter the policy landscape.\n‚ÄúThe demand is not regulatory driven,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMost of the quality SAF producers actually have more demand than they can supply.‚Äù He adds that one of Kerogen‚Äôs portfolio companies, Hong Kong-based EcoCeres, is completely sold out of its SAF supply, and is planning to build a new plant that would double the company‚Äôs capacity‚Äîwhich Chen expects will also sell out.\nGrowing demand means there will be a race for feedstocks to produce the fuel. Used cooking oils and waste fats are likely to serve as feedstock for the first 3 billion gallons of SAF production, as targeted in the US Federal government‚Äôs SAF Grand Challenge‚Äîits road map for reaching 100 percent SAF use by 2050. However, those supplies are limited, and to move beyond them at scale the industry will need to use plant-based feedstocks, including new commodities such as camelina. Other companies are producing SAF from hemp, sweet potatoes, or even milk waste.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly difficult to create a new commodity within the United States,‚Äù William Hohenstein, a director at the US Department of Agriculture, said during a panel discussion in September. ‚ÄúIt doesn't happen very often, and the reason it‚Äôs so challenging is because the farmers need to be confident that if they‚Äôre going to invest in growing a crop that there‚Äôs a market, and if you‚Äôre going to invest on the industry side, you need to know the feedstock is there.‚Äù\nThe US could theoretically achieve the amount of renewable biomass resources required to meet the milestones of the SAF Grand Challenge, according to a report from the US Department of Energy. But the emergence of viable feedstocks and energy crops will need to overcome challenges like finding adequate demand as SAF production grows, pitting energy crops against food crops and finding enough farmland, and a lack of transportation infrastructure.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the farmer and the ultimate consumer. All of the steps along the way: the crushing capacity, the transportation capacity, all of that has to emerge together,‚Äù Hohenstein said.\nPeter Frosch, the CEO of Greater MSP, a Saint Paul‚Äìbased nonprofit economic development organization that‚Äôs helping to advance the Minnesota SAF hub, takes these challenges in stride.\nHe said that, so far, forming the SAF demand consortium with Delta, Bank of America, Deloitte, and Ecolab, as well as having the blending facility infrastructure in the works, has helped to attract interest from project developers and additional potential off-takers. One of those partners, DG Fuels, in October announced a new $5 billion plant in Moorhead, Minnesota, that will eventually produce 193 million gallons of SAF per year using corn stover and timber waste as feedstock. It will flow through the Pine Bend refinery.\n‚ÄúThere are a thousand reasons this isn‚Äôt going to work,‚Äù Frosch says, rattling off a laundry list of challenges the hub is facing: getting enough farmers to grow a new crop or change their farming practices; auditing the carbon intensity of the sustainable fuels; the availability of state and federal incentives; bringing in additional investment and production partners.\nIn an emailed statement, Frosch says that potential changes to tax credits or the DOE‚Äôs Loan Programs Office have not directly impacted the Minnesota hub‚Äôs conversations with potential SAF producers, but he adds that the uncertainty in Washington ‚Äúdoes not support rapid and confident decisionmaking.‚Äù\nThe hub is in talks with producers that ‚Äúrun the gamut of feedstocks and technology, from using wood waste to produce SAF to making it literally out of thin air‚Äù through a process involving capturing carbon directly from the atmosphere, he says.\n‚ÄúAll of this is hard; that‚Äôs the whole idea,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs industrial innovation. We seem to be a little bit on the frontier of doing this at this scale, which means we seem to be encountering some of the big problems that eventually everyone‚Äôs going to have to solve.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "Last week, a Jeep driver turned to Reddit to do what people do best on the site‚Äîcomplain. Every time they hit the brakes on their Jeep, they wrote, a promotion for an extended warranty plan popped up in the center console. ‚ÄúPress the ‚Äòcall‚Äô button to speak to a specialist,‚Äù they say the ad encouraged, welcoming the user to use their Bluetooth connection to complete the upsell then and there.\nAds are annoying and occasionally insidious; an ad that repeatedly appears inside one‚Äôs own car more so. According to other online posts on Reddit and Jeep forums, the issue goes back several years, affecting several models of Jeeps.\nStellantis, which owns Jeep, says the repetitive nature of the promotion was a glitch. ‚ÄúThis is an isolated incident affecting fewer than ten vehicles at this time limited to the US,‚Äù Dan Reid, a spokesperson for the automaker, wrote in a statement. He acknowledged, though, that Stellantis shows other drivers in-vehicle promotions too. Dodge owners, for example, get an infotainment push after 60 days of purchase offering the Dodge Complete Performance Package, a comprehensive warranty offering. Stellantis says that, on average, customers receive about two in-vehicle messages annually, containing safety, maintenance, or marketing information.\nShould ads be showing up inside cars at all? Safety experts have serious questions about the practice. But as automakers continue to explore how to make more money off their increasingly digitized and internet-connected wheels, the temptation to upsell on the center console may be too good to pass up.\nThe Data-Powered Upsell\nToday‚Äôs new cars come stuffed with some 1,000 to 3,000 semiconductor chips that help to control and coordinate everything from lowering windows and adjusting mirrors to deploying airbags, enabling collision avoidance systems, pairing phones with center consoles and displays, and coordinating navigation. Add in the internet and drivers‚Äô cell phones, and you get an ongoing ‚Äúconversation‚Äù of data between individual cars and the manufacturers that build them.\nThose manufacturers‚Äô vision of the future has been pretty consistent over the past few years, says Mark Wakefield, the global automotive market lead at consulting firm AlixPartners. ‚ÄúIn an ideal world, they‚Äôve totally blended the mobile phone and different services and apps into a nice, big coherent ecosystem that travels from work to play to home,‚Äù he says. It‚Äôs the perfect platform for advertising, for upselling, and for pushing premium trimmings. As with Jeep‚Äôs extended warranty offer, many services can show up with just a remote software push.\nSelling a car is a tight margin business; selling software-enabled features, less so. AlixPartners research estimates the connected vehicle services market will be worth more than $473 million globally this year, accounting for 11 percent of automotive revenue streams. By 2032, it could be worth $1.68 billion‚Äîmore than a quarter of manufacturers‚Äô revenue.\nSome of these software-related plays have already worked out for automakers. General Motors brought in some $2 billion in revenue last year from OnStar, its subscription-based security and entertainment services division, and executives are sticking with a prediction first made in 2021 that the automaker will eventually make more than $20 billion annually in software-related revenue. Customers have shown that they‚Äôre willing to shell out a few bucks for services that heats or cool drivers‚Äô cars before they get in, or turn on the garage lights when they get back home.\nOther software plays have not worked well at all. General Motors settled a lawsuit this year with the US government after allegations it collected, used, and sold drivers‚Äô data without their consent. Customers were horrified when BMW offered to turn on drivers‚Äô seat heaters for a monthly fee. (The subscription was available in a handful of countries, including the UK, Germany, and South Korea.) The automaker discontinued the program after an outcry.\nThese experiences suggest there‚Äôs a limit to customers‚Äô patience for data-enabled auto add-ons and the advertisements automakers use to promote them. ‚ÄúThe guy in the black turtleneck with the frameless glasses in the design studio still thinks the extended digital environment in the vehicle is going to happen,‚Äù says Wakefield. ‚ÄúThe customer service rep probably thinks it‚Äôs never going to happen.‚Äù The question is how long drivers are willing to put up with being trapped in their cars with tiny, digital car salesmen before they all take to Reddit‚Äîor buy different vehicles altogether.\nDriven to Distraction\nSafety advocates, meanwhile, say any kind of in-car screen pop-up can be dangerous. ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs attention can be easily pulled by that sort of thing, and it‚Äôs vitally important that the demands on drivers‚Äô attention be kept in check,‚Äù says William Wallace, who directs safety advocacy at Consumer Reports. He calls a snafu like Jeep‚Äôs alleged glitch ‚Äúunacceptable.‚Äù\nAuto safety research suggests that when messages are sent to a car‚Äôs infotainment systems, and how long they‚Äôre displayed, determines whether they‚Äôre safe, says William Horrey, a technical director with the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. Generally though, ‚Äúmessages sent during any driving trip can be detrimental to safety as they pull drivers‚Äô eyes away from the roadway,‚Äù he writes in an email. Even messages that draw drivers‚Äô eyes away from the road‚Äîand potential road hazards‚Äîduring a red light can lead to accidents, both because drivers can start driving again with being fully aware of their surroundings, and because research shows that the effects of distraction can linger even seconds after drivers‚Äô eyes return to the road.\nStellantis didn‚Äôt respond to questions about promotion messages and road safety. Neither did the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the US‚Äô top road safety regulator, though it published guidance more than a decade ago suggesting that displaying images or video unrelated to driving or requiring reading of more than 30 characters of text ‚Äúinherently interfere with a driver‚Äôs ability to safely operate the vehicle.‚Äù\nNathan Proctor, who follows auto issues as the senior director of US Public Interest Research Group‚Äôs right to repair campaign, says the Jeep ad snafu points to the need for wider reform in the internet-of-autos sector. ‚ÄúI think we should have a mandatory internet off switch in cars,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhat am I getting out of my car being connected to the internet? I get cybersecurity risk, privacy invasion, they can subpoena info from my car.‚Äù So far, the switch doesn‚Äôt exist. Maybe some drivers really want the opportunity to buy a cheaper extended warranty. Proctor says it's far from worth the trade-off.",

He acknowledged, though, that Stellantis shows other drivers in-vehicle promotions too. Dodge owners, for example, get an infotainment push after 60 days of purchase offering the Dodge Complete Performance Package, a comprehensive warranty offering. Stellantis says that, on average, customers receive about two in-vehicle messages annually, containing safety, maintenance, or marketing information.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Should ads be showing up inside cars at all? Safety experts have serious questions about the practice. But as automakers continue to explore how to make more money off their increasingly digitized and internet-connected wheels, the temptation to upsell on the center console may be too good to pass up.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><strong>The Data-Powered Upsell</strong></h2><p class=\"paywall\">Today‚Äôs new cars come stuffed with some 1,000 to 3,000 semiconductor chips that help to control and coordinate everything from lowering windows and adjusting mirrors to deploying airbags, enabling collision avoidance systems, pairing phones with center consoles and displays, and coordinating navigation. Add in the internet and drivers‚Äô cell phones, and you get an ongoing ‚Äúconversation‚Äù of data between individual cars and the manufacturers that build them.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Those manufacturers‚Äô vision of the future has been pretty consistent over the past few years, says Mark Wakefield, the global automotive market lead at consulting firm AlixPartners. ‚ÄúIn an ideal world, they‚Äôve totally blended the mobile phone and different services and apps into a nice, big coherent ecosystem that travels from work to play to home,‚Äù he says. It‚Äôs the perfect platform for advertising, for upselling, and for pushing premium trimmings. As with Jeep‚Äôs extended warranty offer, many services can show up with just a remote software push.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Selling a car is a tight margin business; selling software-enabled features, less so. AlixPartners research estimates the connected vehicle services market will be worth more than $473 million globally this year, accounting for 11 percent of automotive revenue streams. By 2032, it could be worth $1.68 billion‚Äîmore than a quarter of manufacturers‚Äô revenue.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Some of these software-related plays have already worked out for automakers.

    "content_text": "In the early morning of January 21, David Balland and his wife were forced at gunpoint into separate vehicles outside their home in M√©reau, a commune in the opulent Loire Valley, France. The kidnappers had targeted Balland, who cofounded cryptocurrency wallet company Ledger, with the goal of winning a ransom, a prosecutor has claimed.\nThe kidnappers communicated their demands‚Äîthe specifics of which have not been disclosed by law enforcement‚Äîto √âric Larchev√™que, another Ledger cofounder. To flush out the full payment, they severed one of Balland‚Äôs fingers. French authorities dispatched more than 200 officers to investigate.\nOn January 22, officers rescued Balland from a property in the neighboring town of Ch√¢teauroux. They later discovered his wife‚Äîtrussed up but otherwise unharmed‚Äîin the back of a beaten up van.\nThese events were relayed by Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau at a press conference on January 23 and in subsequent reports. The authorities had arrested 10 people suspected to be connected to the kidnapping, Beccuau announced. For acts of ‚Äútorture, barbarity, and extortion,‚Äù she said, those arrested face up to life in prison if convicted.\nLedger declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation and the need to afford privacy to Balland. In an X post, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier wrote, ‚ÄúWe are deeply relieved that David and his wife have been released.‚Äù\nThe grisly kidnapping‚Äîwhich came shortly after a crypto executive was held for ransom in Canada and the assassination of the United Healthcare CEO‚Äîhas spooked the crypto industry. To protect themselves, wealthy crypto figures are turning to bodyguard services, which have experienced an influx of requests, sources with knowledge of the physical security sector tell WIRED.\n‚ÄúLike any human emotion, fear is a significant motivator ‚Ä¶ The headlines certainly mobilize a lot of that concern,‚Äù says Adam Healy, a former US Marine and chief executive at crypto-focused cybersecurity company Station 70, who frequently helps industry contacts to secure physical security services. ‚ÄúDemand has grown considerably.‚Äù\nBecause not every case of kidnap or extortion is reported, it is difficult to objectively assess the actual risk to wealthy figures in crypto. In making the fear of kidnap more acute, the headlines benefit the private security businesses, themselves incentivized to overstate the threat.\nHowever, it is the case that people who control large amounts of crypto are more exposed to violent extortion than the typical executive by the nature of the technology: Unlike regular currency, crypto is stored in digital wallets protected only by alphanumeric keys. Because crypto transactions are irreversible, if a bad actor can coerce someone into handing over their key, they gain unfettered access to the coins in their wallet.\n‚ÄúThat is one of the principles on which crypto was founded‚Äîthe principle of self-custody. Not your keys, not your crypto,‚Äù says one crypto executive who has previously used bodyguard protection, who asked to remain anonymous for personal safety reasons. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the equivalent to stuffing [your money in] your mattress.‚Äù\nOver time, crypto organizations have taken steps to dilute the risk associated with self-custody, including by storing coins in special wallets that require the signature of multiple people for any transactions to take place. Sometimes they go as far as to split wallet keys into several shards, each of which can be stored in a separate high-security bunker across the globe. But even elaborate measures only go so far in disincentivizing kidnap and attempted extortion.\n‚ÄúThere are many more layers of security now than five or 10 years ago,‚Äù says the crypto executive. ‚ÄúBut at the end of the day ‚Ä¶ gun to your head, the [kidnapper] has all your money.‚Äù\nThough disproven many years ago, the misconception that crypto transactions are anonymous and untraceable has contributed to the danger faced by members of the crypto industry, claims Healy. ‚ÄúWhat the bad guys see is untraceable internet money in the millions of dollars. That‚Äôs not an entirely true characterization‚Äîbut that‚Äôs all they see. They see this as an easy button,‚Äù he says.\nThe way crypto investors think about physical security has evolved markedly over time, security experts report, in line with changes in the amount of money that has flowed into the industry, the level of public attention, and the understanding of risks associated with flaunting crypto wealth.\nIn 2013, after bitcoin experienced a surge in price, early investors sought bodyguard protection as an outward display of their new wealth, says John Moore, managing director at Westminster Security, a London-based private security firm. This generation of crypto nouveau riche‚Äîwhom Moore took to calling the ‚ÄúBitcoin Boys‚Äù‚Äîwould fly to London for luxury shopping trips and ask for security to be laid on thick. ‚ÄúThey thought it looked cool to be seen to have an entourage of bodyguards and luxury vehicles,‚Äù says Moore. ‚ÄúIt was overkill.‚Äù\nToday, the crypto elite prefer to go unnoticed where possible, usually opting for plainclothes bodyguards‚Äîa reflection of a keener understanding that ‚Äúwealth attracts undesirables,‚Äù says Moore. ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin Boys have grown up. They now go for low-key, covert protection,‚Äù he says.\nFew clients from the crypto sector require round-the-clock supervision, opting to use bodyguards predominantly when attending public events or traveling to locations abroad.\nThe practical reality of protecting a crypto executive differs from case to case, sources say, but generally has more to do with logistics than muscle. It involves corresponding with venues that clients plan to attend, scouting out locations in advance, communicating with law enforcement, and man-marking clients if ever they need to move through a crowd.\n‚ÄúThese guys are like rock stars in the world that they move in,‚Äù says Darrell M. Blocker, who founded personal security company DMB Consulting Services after retiring from a long career as a high-ranking CIA operative. ‚ÄúThe people who follow crypto know who the major stars are.‚Äù\nThe general idea is for a bodyguard never to be forced into action but instead to head off any potential threats long in advance. In rare cases, if a client is traveling to a particularly dangerous region, that might involve laying on armed escorts and bulletproof vehicles, or even paying off gangs and cartels that control particular territories, claims Blocker.\n‚ÄúWe talk to the cops, and we talk to the people the cops would want to put in jail. We have to be able to talk to both parties,‚Äù says Blocker. ‚ÄúKidnapping is a business‚Äîand businessmen are willing to negotiate ‚Ä¶ There is honor among thieves.‚Äù\nSometimes, the relationship between bodyguard and client becomes almost familial by way of the close quarters in which they work. In other cases, clients take poorly to the imposition that comes with having their movements planned out meticulously‚Äîthey object to being denied spontaneity. ‚ÄúHanding over your life to someone is never an easy task,‚Äù says Blocker.\nAfter incidents like Balland‚Äôs kidnapping, however, crypto figures are coming round to the view that having a security detail is a necessary inconvenience. For every crypto kidnapping that comes to light, an equal number go unreported, estimates Healy, who claims to have been quietly informed about a number of incidents that have never been made public. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs testament to people being really worried ‚Ä¶ They just want it to go away,‚Äù says Healy. ‚ÄúThe risk is real.‚Äù\nBy calling attention to the vulnerabilities specific to handling crypto, high-profile incidents could have the perverse effect of inspiring other would-be extortionists. ‚ÄúThese cases do become very sensationalized, but the risk is copycat attempts being made,‚Äù says Ryan Martin, VP of operations at Crisis24 Private Strategic Group, which provides bodyguarding and other security services.\nThough investors have become smarter about publicizing their crypto wealth and organizations are more savvy about the way they store crypto, some level of threat is unavoidable, says the crypto executive who spoke anonymously to WIRED: ‚ÄúIf you decide to be your own bank, you have to be prepared for the risks.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "A Bangladeshi worker was eager to get started at their new OpenAI job‚Äîcompleting basic online tasks in exchange for consistent income, while getting into cryptocurrency investing at the same time. After connecting with the startup on Telegram and creating an account through a ChatGPT-branded app, they invested crypto into the platform and began a months-long job working for ‚ÄúAiden‚Äù from ‚ÄúOpenAI.‚Äù\nThe work was performed through the website ‚ÄúOpenAi-etc,‚Äù and internal conversations were held on Telegram. It was simple: Invest some crypto, complete a few tasks, and earn daily profits based on what was invested.\nOver the course of this worker‚Äôs time with the company, mentors continuously encouraged them to invest more money into the fund and recruit more Bangladeshi people to the team. When the worker convinced over 150 to join and the mentors split the growing team of ‚Äúbrokers‚Äù into a hierarchy based on seniority, it all felt very real. The total crypto-investment fund for their team was around $50,000. After a devastating cyclone hit Bangladesh in May, company leaders supposedly helped those in need, further earning the trust of employees.\nAll seemed well until the morning of August 29, 2024, when everyone woke up to find that the website, all of their money, Aiden, and the other fake OpenAI employees had vanished overnight. The job, of course, was never with OpenAI at all, former workers say.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen similar scams where, at the beginning, you think you are making profit, and then basically you invest more and more,‚Äù says Shirin Nilizadeh, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Arlington who focuses on security and privacy. ‚ÄúThen, suddenly, you lose everything.‚Äù.\nThe story of the scammed ‚ÄúOpenAI‚Äù worker is from just one of 11 complaints about OpenAi-etc submitted to the US Federal Trade Commission by workers from Bangladesh last year, seven of which mention ‚ÄúAiden.‚Äù Analysis of the complaints, obtained by WIRED through a public records request, reveal a potentially widespread job scam that used OpenAI‚Äôs name recognition to allegedly trick low-wage workers out of their savings. While some people describe getting started with OpenAi-etc in June or July, others believed they were working for the company for around six months.\nThe first FTC complaint obtained by WIRED, lodged over two months before the August 29 rug pull, says the complainant was invited by OpenAi-etc to invest around $170 in crypto. The person mentions an American registration number for the business, confirming it was in good standing with Colorado regulators and listing a physical office in Denver. The complaint also highlights a legitimate-looking money service business registered with the US Treasury‚Äôs Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which lists the company‚Äôs location as an office inside the Empire State Building in New York City.\nA WIRED review of domain name system records for the now-defunct OpenAi-etc website shows that it appears to have been hosted by a China-based web hosting company.\nJay Mayfield, a senior public affairs specialist at the FTC, declined WIRED‚Äôs request to confirm whether the group is looking into OpenAi-etc, saying that investigations are nonpublic. Mayfield did not answer additional questions about what steps the FTC is taking to prevent similar scams or provide better assistance for international victims.\n‚ÄúRegrettably, I found no available source online to know more about this organization except for those registrations,‚Äù wrote the complainant. ‚ÄúThey are collecting huge amounts of investment from third world countries in Asia.‚Äù\nOne of the FTC complaints alleges that over 6,000 people in Bangladesh were potentially impacted by the OpenAi-etc job scam. The ages listed in the FTC complaints range from teenagers to people in their fifties, with locations spread across multiple Bangladesh cities, from Dhaka to Khulna.\n‚ÄúMy next trading date was 29 August, 2024,‚Äù wrote another complainant. ‚ÄúI made the trade with my whole amount in the evening. But, suddenly, the OpenAI company vanished. I didn‚Äôt withdraw any money but lost both capital and profit. Now, I am in a great economic crisis, as I am a normal school teacher.‚Äù\nNiko Felix, a spokesperson for OpenAI, declined to answer questions about whether the startup was previously aware of the ‚ÄúOpenAi-etc‚Äù scam, or if they planned to take action against the fraudsters. But he did share that OpenAI is investigating the matter. The alleged scam website is no longer available online, and WIRED was not able to contact the people behind \"OpenAi-etc\" prior to publication.\nA Telegram spokesperson using the name Remi Vaughn tells WIRED that the company monitors its platform for scams, such as those allegedly carried out by OpenAi-etc, which used the messaging app to communicate with people who believed they were working for the company.\n\"Telegram actively moderates harmful content on its platform, including scams,\" Vaughn says in a statement sent to WIRED through the messaging platform. \"Moderators empowered with custom Al and machine learning tools proactively monitor public parts of the platform and accept reports from users and organizations in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.\"\nThe usual pattern of a crypto job scam is to trick people into depositing some kind of digital currency into a fake account the victim believes they have control over, until the perpetrator drains it one day without warning. While this specific rug pull used OpenAI‚Äôs branding to allegedly dupe its victims, a crypto job scam can happen with the name of any company that has enough widespread recognition for criminals to capitalize on.\n‚ÄúThese social engineering scams are designed to lower our natural suspicion and to make us complicit in our own deception,‚Äù says Arun Vishwanath, a cybersecurity expert and author of The Weakest Link. ‚ÄúFor job scams, they try to turn our ambitions and inherent trust in brands into a vulnerability.‚Äù Similar to so-called pig butchering investment scams, a key component often includes direct messages over a long period of time to cultivate a sense of trust with the targets.\nAlthough comparable job scams happen all over the world, Vishwanath believes that Asian cultural norms of so-called high power distance, where there‚Äôs more acceptance of interpersonal hierarchies, are a contributing factor. \"Authorities are expected to ask you things and make you do things,\" he says. \"And you just comply.\" Scammers are taking advantage of this by imitating authority figures and leaning into the sense of urgency inherent to searching for a job.\nBangladeshi citizens on the difficult hunt for reliable work have increasingly been targeted by job scammers in recent years. Lies about international job opportunities have left throngs of would-be workers stranded in Malaysia, and at least three cases of kidney organ theft were reported by people lured to India with false promises of work.",

    "content_text": "Vladislav Klyushin was having, by any measure, an awful day. The judge in his case had brushed aside his lawyers‚Äô arguments and his friends‚Äô appeals for leniency. She handed down a tough sentence: nine more years in US federal prison, on top of an order to forfeit a fortune, $34 million.\nBut if Klyushin was upset about the ruling, he didn‚Äôt show it. The then 42-year-old tech executive from Moscow seemed upbeat‚Äîquick with a smile on his pinchable cheeks and unerringly polite, just as he had been during his arrest near a Swiss ski resort in March 2021, his months of detention in Switzerland, his extradition to the United States that December, his indictment and trial on hacking and wire fraud charges, and his swift conviction. Klyushin ‚Äúhad a confidence all along that eventually the Russians would get him back,‚Äù one of his defense attorneys told me. He seemed certain that his protectors in the Kremlin would spare him from serving out his full sentence.\nThere were times when that certainty seemed cocksure. America‚Äôs federal prison system held 35 Russian nationals. Surely not all of them were getting traded back. His family and friends were distraught. Within less than a year, though, Klyushin was proven right. On August 1, 2024, he was unshackled and put on a plane back to Moscow‚Äîone of the 24 people involved in the largest, most complex US-Russian prisoner exchange ever.\nYou probably heard something about the swap. It‚Äôs the one that brought Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan home to the United States‚Äîand sent back to Russia a Kremlin-linked assassin and a husband-and-wife duo of spies who were so deep undercover that their kids didn‚Äôt learn they were Russian until they got on the plane. In coverage of the exchange, Klyushin was treated as a footnote. That was a mistake, if an understandable one. And not just because he was at the center of one of the bigger insider trading cases of all time.\nThe escalating conflict between the US and Russia has played out in all sorts of ways over the past decade. One American captive was swapped just two weeks ago; at least 10 more US citizens remain imprisoned in Russia. And now, there‚Äôs a Kremlin-friendly occupant of the Oval Office, one who loves to be seen as making deals. One is in global financial markets, with America and its allies walling more and more of Russian industry off from the international economy. There are always creative individuals who can find cracks in that wall, though, and Klyushin sure seems to have been one of them. You don‚Äôt have to squint too hard to see his scheme‚Äîwhich ultimately netted $93 million‚Äîas a way to bring capital into Russia, despite the global blockade. The contest has also been evident on the streets of Moscow, where a secretive Kremlin security force has grabbed American citizens, who are charged with bogus crimes, and then dangled them in trades for killers, spies, and associates of the Kremlin. It‚Äôs kidnapping, hostage taking, and it‚Äôs effectively all being done on President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs orders. Oftentimes, Americans are taken precisely for their value as assets to be later exchanged‚Äîto get back people like that assassin, or this financial crook, Klyushin. He wasn‚Äôt at the very top of Moscow‚Äôs trade list. But Klyushin was much closer, and more important to the Kremlin, than either side was willing to admit.\nTo the outside world, Klyushin had a rags-to-riches, fairy-tale life, with a gauzy wedding video to prove it. In a montage later obtained by US prosecutors, Klyushin dives into a country club pool; his bride-to-be, Zhannetta, sips pink champagne on an outdoor bed draped with chiffon and roses; he picks her up in a white Porsche convertible; she‚Äôs gorgeous in her backless gown; he‚Äôs handsome, if a little goofy, in his tux and subtle mullet; they dance and laugh and stare meaningfully at the fireworks punctuating the perfect night. ‚ÄúI do not know a more decent person than my husband,‚Äù Zhannetta later wrote to the judge in his case.\nThey had three children, adding to the two Klyushin had from a previous marriage. By all accounts, he was a doting father, a far cry from his own, a man he never met, or his stepfather, who was killed during a car robbery when Klyushin was 14. He emerged from a childhood of poverty to build a number of businesses. First, he was in construction and marketing; later, he ran an IT company called M13, which sold media- and internet-monitoring software to Russian government agencies. Early customers in 2016 included the Ministry of Defense and the office of the presidential administration, where Putin‚Äôs propaganda chief became an important proponent of M13. The company‚Äôs software was used to keep tabs on hundreds of Telegram channels for a Kremlin worried about the ‚Äúintroduction of unverified or knowingly false information,‚Äù according to one local news report.\nKlyushin‚Äôs rise was rapid, taking in more than $30 million in government contracts in a decade. That confounded some of his professional peers. (‚ÄúThe company and its owner are unknown to most in the IT community,‚Äù a respected Russian business journal noted in 2021.) But it brought him influence and admirers. He supported the arts and rebuilt the roof of the monastery on Moscow‚Äôs Lubyanka Street, a few blocks down from the headquarters of Russia‚Äôs spy service, the FSB. One friend later hailed Klyushin as an ‚Äúeco-activist‚Äù (for planting ‚Äúseveral spruces in the yard‚Äù) and a ‚Äúpet-lover‚Äù (his ‚Äúfavourite pet is a dog‚Äù). ‚ÄúBroad-minded, well-read, educated,‚Äù gushed his family friend and tennis coach. An M13 employee said that a conversation with Klyushin ‚Äúis like getting a lesson from a guru.‚Äù\nMoscow is filled with entrepreneurs who get rich by cozying up to the government; Klyushin seemed to reach another, higher level. He and M13 allegedly became so close to Moscow‚Äôs power brokers that an independent media outlet suggested he was one of the people behind an anonymous, inside-the-Kremlin Telegram channel with nearly 200,000 followers. Klyushin denied the allegation and successfully sued the outlet over the insinuation.\nKlyushin‚Äôs most consequential professional connection was with Ivan Ermakov, an internationally infamous hacker. It‚Äôs unclear when the two men met, but by April 2018 they were friendly enough to go heli-skiing together. Ermakov, a then 32-year-old with large, youthful brown eyes that made him look a decade younger, had recently served in Unit 26165 of Russia‚Äôs main intelligence directorate, the GRU. In cybersecurity and political circles, the unit was known as ‚ÄúFancy Bear.‚Äù It was notorious for hacking into the networks of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, acts that helped throw the 2016 US election to Trump. Ermakov conducted some of Fancy Bear‚Äôs break-ins personally, American prosecutors alleged in 2018. This was around when Ermakov and Klyushin were attending the World Cup together in Sochi. Ermakov was indicted again that October for a series of Fancy Bear hacks around the 2016 summer Olympics. Ermakov made it onto an FBI most-wanted list. Klyushin kept a copy of the FBI poster in his iCloud account.\nAt the time, Ermakov was obtaining information that would be central to Klyushin‚Äôs next big business venture: making money in the American stock market. According to encrypted chats later obtained by prosecutors, Klyushin would soon open a brokerage account through a Danish company, which Ermakov and an M13 employee appear to have used to make trades in a broad range of stocks‚Äîreal-estate firms, natural gas concerns, food service businesses. At first, the endeavor didn‚Äôt go well. The chats show transactions being mistimed, information about companies miscommunicated, and price movements misunderstood. ‚ÄúThe market behaves strangely,‚Äù says Ermakov. ‚ÄúWe suck,‚Äù complains one M13 employee. The trades that did succeed, though, tended to have a common theme: They happened right before the companies released their regularly scheduled public earnings reports. It was as if Klyushin‚Äôs contacts had access to privileged information.\nWhich, prosecutors say, they did.\nThere are, broadly speaking, a few types of insider trading. Some prosecutors have come to call the more prevalent kind ‚Äúgolfer cases,‚Äù along the lines of an executive at a public company passing confidential information on the links to a buddy, who then plays the market. It‚Äôs illegal but often relatively constrained: one insider, one company. (Actual golf legend Phil Mickelson paid back more than $1 million in connection with one such case in 2016.)\nA rarer, potentially more destructive kind of insider trading involves finding a choke point in the flow of financial information and obtaining confidential data about dozens, hundreds, even thousands of companies at once. That‚Äôs what happened in the early 2010s, when a Ukrainian hacker broke into press release distributors like PR Newswire and exfiltrated before-it‚Äôs-public information on dozens of different companies. That hack allegedly resulted in around $30 million in illegal profits. For reasons that aren‚Äôt entirely clear, Klyushin kept a printout about the PR Newswire hacker in a pink, translucent folder. He‚Äîor someone‚Äîsnapped a photo of the article next to a bottle of ros√©.\nKlyushin and Ermakov‚Äôs insider trading scheme started, investigators believe, in early to mid 2018. (The details below were drawn from court records, trial transcripts, and evidence submitted during a later trial.) That‚Äôs when some awfully strange behavior started occurring in the networks of Donnelley Financial Solutions‚Äîa document management firm that prepares earnings reports for big, publicly traded companies. On May 9, the account of a longtime Donnelley employee, Julie Soma, started downloading a flurry of confidential financial reports that had been prepared for client companies. That was something she‚Äôd ‚Äúnever‚Äù do, Soma later testified. The browser and operating system information associated with her account‚Äôs burst of activity also didn‚Äôt match her normal behavior. Plus, all of this was happening late at night, way past the hours Soma typically worked from her home in Richland, Washington.\nSeveral other accounts also displayed atypical behavior, and at least one Donnelley-linked laptop, in London, was found to have a suspicious tool on it. This program, which allowed the computer to be remote-controlled, tried to collect usernames and passwords inside Donnelley‚Äôs networks, then cover its tracks by deleting the system logs. Finally, the tool attempted to connect the laptop to a bogus site, ‚Äúinvestmentcomp.com‚Äù‚Äîa classic hacker trick to covertly collect data from a victim‚Äôs system.\nIn November, a Donnelley competitor was hit too. At Toppan Merrill, investigators later discovered that a program called DirBuster was making multiple guesses per second to identify file names and network paths. Other malicious software echoed what was happening on the Donnelley machines.\nKlyushin‚Äôs investments, meanwhile, were expanding. He bought stock in semiconductor manufacturers, roofing suppliers, a firm that makes boats for wakeboarding. At almost every turn, Mikhail Irzak and Igor Sladkov, two associates of Ermakov‚Äôs from St. Petersburg, bought those same stocks. (Irzak, Sladkov, and Ermakov were all also indicted.) The volume of their trades often dwarfed Klyushin‚Äôs. When he purchased 1,350 shares of Tesla just ahead of its earnings report that fall, the St. Petersburg duo bought 16,300. Klyushin netted an estimated $9,000 from the deal; they got more than $145,000. Prosecutors never established a direct link between Klyushin and Ermakov‚Äôs friends from St. Petersburg. But one of those buddies had an internal M13 messaging app in his iCloud account, even though he was never an employee or client of the firm. An economist for the US Securities and Exchange Commission later put the odds of the group‚Äôs trading patterns being a coincidence at less than one in a trillion.\nThe scheme attracted more investors. Ermakov and Klyushin shared their tips with the new clients and took a 60 percent cut of anything those outside investors made. One newcomer ran an audiovisual and IT company; M13 had recently pitched it on a whitehat hacker-for-hire package. Two other investors were described by Klyushin‚Äôs attorneys as old friends of his: former mining executive Aleksandr Borodaev and Boris Varshavskiy, who received the ‚ÄúGold Badge of Distinction of Russian Coal‚Äù and briefly served as the minister of ecology and natural resources for a region in southern Siberia. ‚ÄúI did the math for Boris,‚Äù Klyushin texted Ermakov in May 2019. ‚ÄúThe profit comes to 198% ‚Ä¶ Boris earned $989k on $500k ‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt even ask why.‚Äù (Neither Borodaev nor Varshavskiy was charged in the US. It was not established at trial that either of them knew about the insider trading scheme.)\nErmakov responded with a thumbs-up and three laugh-cry emojis. The pair grew closer‚Äîhitting the sauna, going out to dinners with the M13 crew. They texted about their favorite TV shows. Klyushin was really into Billions, about a hedge fund manager who made it big off of insider trading.\nOn July 16, 2019, the Julie Soma account at Donnelley Financial downloaded an upcoming press release from the sneaker company Skechers. The document‚Äîone of more than 2,000 files illicitly downloaded using Soma‚Äôs credentials‚Äîshowed that business was booming in the second quarter, well above what the market was expecting. ‚ÄúWe buy SKX today,‚Äù wrote Ermakov on the morning of July 18 in the encrypted chat, referring to Skechers‚Äô symbol on the New York Stock Exchange. The St. Petersburg pair snatched up 130,000 shares; Klyushin, almost 50,000; his mining buddies, 77,500. The earnings officially dropped at 4:05 pm ET that day. SKX shot up from $34 to $39. Klyushin‚Äôs crew liquidated almost all of their positions immediately.\nKlyushin was pumped. ‚ÄúSo ‚Ä¶ What did we earn today? Our comrades are wondering,‚Äù he wrote in the encrypted group chat, and he posted photos of Borodaev and Varshavskiy. Ermakov, who months earlier was fine texting about the outside investors, was growing wary. He told Klyushin to knock it off. ‚ÄúVlad, you are exposing our organization. This is bad,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how they get you and you end up as a defendant in a court room.‚Äù\nA month later, former US Marine Trevor Reed was taken to jail in Moscow and sent to a state psychiatric facility. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs blood all over the walls where prisoners had killed themselves or killed other prisoners,‚Äù he later told CNN. ‚ÄúThe toilet is just a hole in the floor and there‚Äôs, you know, crap everywhere, all over the floor, on the walls. There‚Äôs people in there that walk around, they look like zombies.‚Äù\nA similarly nightmarish story had recently unfolded for Paul Whelan, another former US Marine. He had gone to Russia for the wedding of a buddy when FSB agents burst into his hotel room and accused him of espionage. He was sent to a gulag that housed World War II prisoners and was given a job sewing buttons on winter uniforms. Cold showers were allowed, once a week. Meals consisted of ‚Äúbread, tea, and a watery fish soup that seemed better suited as cat food,‚Äù according to The New York Times.\nReed and Whelan were two of four US citizens arrested by Russian authorities during Trump‚Äôs first term, all on what appeared to be the flimsiest of pretenses. The Kremlin made it clear to the White House that some or all of the Americans would be let go‚Äîif the US government gave up some notorious Russian criminals in return. Moscow and Washington had been exchanging captured spies for six decades, off and on. This was something different. This had all the hallmarks of a ransom operation.\nThe SEC, meanwhile, was picking up hints that a group of Russians was engaged in awfully strange stock sales‚Äîtransactions that sure looked like insider trading. It wasn‚Äôt long before the FBI was looped in. Special agent B. J. Kang took the case. Best known for spearheading the probe that inspired Klyushin‚Äôs beloved show, Billions, Kang was already working on another insider trading investigation with two prosecutors at the US Attorney‚Äôs office in Massachusetts. Since this seemed like a similar-ish case, he brought them in. Seth Kosto had spent years trying insider trading and bank fraud cases. Stephen Frank, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, led the investigation into the ‚ÄúVarsity Blues‚Äù college admissions scandal. Together, the three dug in. Seeing the patterns‚Äîmultiple trading accounts making parallel moves, the focus on quarterly earnings‚Äîthe group quickly realized they were observing large-scale fraud. ‚ÄúAnd it was across industries and different kinds of companies,‚Äù Frank tells me. ‚ÄúThe immediate thought we had was, ‚ÄòThis is likely to be some sort of a hack.‚Äô‚Äù\nAfter further analysis of the market patterns, it became clear that the illicitly traded companies had something else in common: Their financial filings were all published by either Donnelley or Toppan Merrill. When investigators approached the two companies, executives didn‚Äôt believe they‚Äôd been hit. The companies launched internal investigations in which their own employees were scrutinized.\nThe feds, meanwhile, conducted a series of ‚Äúpen registers‚Äù‚Äîwhich reveal the connections between accounts, but not their contents‚Äîto try to figure out who in Russia was orchestrating the trades. They zeroed in on the duo from St. Petersburg. Mikhail Irzak claimed to be a marketer. According to public records, Igor Sladkov was a rather prolific entrepreneur, with his hand in restaurants, residential real estate, nonalcoholic beverages, and media buying. The investigators got a warrant to access Sladkov‚Äôs iCloud. Inside the account, they found a screenshot of a Snap Inc. announcement about upcoming company earnings‚Äîtime-stamped from before it was released. It was textbook inside information. ‚ÄúSo: smoking gun,‚Äù Frank says. ‚ÄúHe was cooked.‚Äù\nWhen the feds examined Sladkov‚Äôs WhatsApp account, they saw that he had been communicating constantly with a figure well known to US law enforcement: the twice-indicted former intelligence officer Ivan Ermakov. ‚ÄúYou come across someone who is alleged to have an immense hacking pedigree,‚Äù says Kosto. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden, you have a path to explaining: How has this happened?‚Äù\nAt 7:54 am Eastern time on November 6, 2019, the Julie Soma account at Donnelley downloaded a copy of Roku‚Äôs third-quarter financial results. The company was going to notably miss its targets. Everyone in M13‚Äôs orbit started shorting their Roku shares or trading other financial instruments based on Roku‚Äôs stock. As soon as the earnings came out, Roku‚Äôs price dropped from about $140 per share to less than $120. Klyushin and his investors cleared nearly $9 million in profits.\nKlyushin, though, was getting exhausted. ‚ÄúI am fucking tired rushing all the time. Need a rest,‚Äù he texted Ermakov. He consoled himself in Ermakov‚Äôs company‚Äîand a little retail therapy. Klyushin went apartment shopping with Ermakov, and bought himself a 78-foot, $4 million yacht from a shipyard in Cyprus. ‚ÄúAt this point I want nothing except the boat,‚Äù Klyushin texted Ermakov in February 2020. ‚ÄúMy pleasure is the boat and trading.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen you need nothing. Enjoy your life,‚Äù Ermakov responded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve read somewhere that if you keep buying while you have everything, it means you‚Äôre unhappy.‚Äù\nKlyushin answered, ‚ÄúHonestly I get a bigger kick when I check apartments for you, with you, the fact that we can walk home together and have a beer, or play golf, or simply send everyone to hell, knowing that you are close.‚Äù\nThey didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but they had only a few months left together to trade. By then, Toppan Merrill had introduced two-factor authentication to its system, effectively locking the hackers out. Donnelley had cut off access to Julie Soma‚Äôs compromised account. Employees at Klyushin and Ermakov‚Äôs brokerage firm were getting suspicious too. In an April Skype call with an executive at Denmark-based Saxo Bank, Klyushin and another M13 employee asked for more banking privileges. The Saxo executive politely pushed back‚Äîand then asked why so many of Klyushin‚Äôs best trades seemed to happen right around the release of earnings‚Äô reports.\nThe M13 employee offered that it was the company‚Äôs media-monitoring prowess that gave them the edge. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, ahem, first mass media. Second social media. And, uh, third, it‚Äôs, ahem, information investment sites,‚Äù the employee said.\n‚ÄúWe have an application,‚Äù Klyushin added, more smoothly, ‚Äúwhich we are planning to launch onto the international market together with Swiss [investors], which in no way will be connected to the Russian Federation.‚Äù That way, M13 will be ‚Äúopen [to] investors from Europe and America.‚Äù\nIf M13 really was developing a specialized program for traders, there‚Äôs scant evidence of it. But the idea of recruiting Western investors to trade on ill-gotten tips‚Äîthat part was true. Klyushin and Ermakov were once photographed at a party with Anselm Schmucki, a Swiss citizen who ran the Russian office of DuLac Capital, a Zurich-based investment firm. ‚ÄúThe goal was to offer this service to international clients‚Äîyou know, whoever Anselm worked with,‚Äù Max Nemtsev, one of Klyushin‚Äôs lawyers, tells me.\nSchmucki declined to comment for this story. His former business partner, Domino Burki, insists their firm, DuLac, did nothing wrong. As for Schmucki himself‚Äîwell, Burki can‚Äôt be so sure what went on in Moscow. ‚ÄúI just feel that Anselm is not a criminal,‚Äù he tells me. ‚ÄúHe was a wheeler-dealer.‚Äù (In 2023, the UK foreign secretary and the US Treasury Department sanctioned Schmucki, with the latter claiming he worked with ‚Äúa company with suspected links to Russian organized crime and money laundering.‚Äù The Treasury Department added, ‚ÄúSchmucki controls a global network of shell companies‚Äù‚Äîat least one of which was based in Edinburgh, Scotland‚Äî‚Äúand has had close financial relationships with an individual charged with financial crimes.‚Äù)\nKlyushin‚Äôs photo with Schmucki was just one of the hundreds of thousands of files that US prosecutors sifted through as investigators obtained warrants for the iCloud accounts of Ermakov, Klyushin, and the rest of the M13 operation. Other images grabbed their attention too: the screenshot of Ermakov trading with Klyushin‚Äôs account; the earnings reports, downloaded days before they became public; the small fleet of Porsche convertibles, like the one he drove in his wedding video; the encrypted chats that were backed up to Klyushin‚Äôs iCloud. This was enough evidence for an open-and-shut case, from Ermakov‚Äôs warning about ending up in a ‚Äúcourt room,‚Äù which proved criminal intent, to the specific dates, times, and prices of the trades made with stolen information. One other photo stood out: a Russian Medal of Honor, given to Klyushin on June 14, 2020, and signed by one ‚ÄúV. Putin.‚Äù\nThe day after Klyushin got his medal, Paul Whelan, the former US Marine, found himself standing in a glass cage in a Moscow City Court, dressed in a blue-gray sweater. He held up a sign: ‚ÄúSham trial! Meatball surgery!‚Äù referring to the manufactured espionage charges against him and the emergency hernia operation he had undergone weeks earlier. He implored then president Trump to save him. Two men in ski masks, plaid shirts, and holstered pistols stood by his side while the judge handed down his sentence: 16 years in a gulag turned labor camp.\nA month and a half later, Trevor Reed received his nine-year sentence and was also sent to a horrific facility. He refused to work. They locked him in solitary confinement and eventually took away his books. He went on hunger strike. After that, he told CNN, ‚ÄúI started to get sick. I really at that point was consistently sick until I left. I started to cough up blood, and I coughed up that blood for a period of about three and a half months every day, multiple times a day.‚Äù\nBy the end of the summer, the M13 crew had stopped trading off of the Donnelley and Toppan Merrill data, and prosecutors had no way of getting to them while they were in Russia. The hope was that one of them would decide to travel to a place where the government was relatively friendly to the US. Whoever left first‚ÄîSladkov, Irzak, Ermakov, Klyushin, you name it‚Äîthat‚Äôs who was getting cuffed; everyone else would become a coconspirator in an insider trading case of stunning scale. ‚ÄúThere was no plan B,‚Äù Frank tells me.\nErmakov, already under two US federal indictments, had the good sense to stay in Russia. Klyushin, on the other hand, really wanted to experience the thrill of heli-skiing again. And this time, he had to do it in the Alps. This time, he‚Äôd take his wife. They‚Äôd celebrate their anniversary.\nIn the US, prosecutors began preparing their criminal complaint against Klyushin. The FBI reached out to Swiss authorities. On Sunday, March 21, 2021, Klyushin and his wife took off from Moscow in a private jet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre literally holding your breath,‚Äù Frank told CNBC. The Klyushins landed about four hours later at Sion airport, in Switzerland. ‚ÄúHe was actually in ski gear, getting off the plane ready to board a helicopter,‚Äù Frank said. ‚ÄúThe Swiss agents were waiting for him. They swooped in.‚Äù\nThis is the point in the story when things get a little murky, a little strange. Klyushin was taken to a jail in Sion in handcuffs and leg irons, according to the local press. He was kept in solitary confinement and held without bail. But ‚Äúhe was not afraid or anything. He was in quite a relaxed mood,‚Äù says Oliver Ciric, the Swiss lawyer who quickly signed on to Klyushin‚Äôs case. Ciric‚Äîa multilingual expert on Russian responses to Western sanctions, and, improbably, an honorary consul of the Republic of Vanuatu‚Äîtold the press that his client was arrested only after he refused advances by British and American intelligence operatives, first in a bar in the south of France and later in Edinburgh, Scotland. The implication was that these alleged spies were trying to pump Klyushin for information about his Kremlin contacts‚Äîor recruit him as an agent. It wasn‚Äôt a crazy claim, given Klyushin‚Äôs proximity to the Putin administration. But Ciric had no evidence to back it up.\nOn April 7, the Kremlin asked the Swiss to extradite Klyushin back to Moscow. The man was a wanted criminal, the Russians claimed, accused of wide-scale financial fraud. That was odd, given how much the Kremlin was paying Klyushin‚Äôs company. Stranger still was Klyushin‚Äôs willingness to go along with the extradition request, since he‚Äôd presumably have to face the infamously brutal Russian justice system. The American government asked for Klyushin to be sent to the US 12 days later. That request was granted in late June. Everyone involved agreed that the process was unusually quick‚Äîhigh-profile extradition cases can drag on for years. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs completely out of the standard procedures,‚Äù Ciric says. ‚ÄúThis is something that we attribute to the pressures, political pressures.‚Äù\nIn June of that year, at a lakeside villa near Geneva, Putin and US president Joe Biden discussed a potential prisoner swap. It was a topic long under discussion, through a number of channels‚Äîformal exchanges by diplomats, less formal discussions by a shifting network of outside lawyers and advocates. No agreements were reached that day. But the two countries opened up a new channel, this one between the CIA and its Kremlin counterparts.\nAfter a series of appeals, Klyushin was sent to the US in December and held at Plymouth County jail. A trial date was set for about a year later. For a case of this complexity, that, too, was awfully quick. In part, that‚Äôs because of an agreement between the Justice Department, Klyushin‚Äôs defense lawyers, and the presiding judge, Patti Saris.\nEach side, for their own reasons, wanted to downplay Klyushin‚Äôs contacts in Russian government and society. Saris, for her part, was worried that too much talk about these connections could be prejudicial to the jury. The prosecutors, according to Frank, wanted to ‚Äúfocus on the actual facts of the insider trading.‚Äù Klyushin‚Äôs American lawyers, meanwhile, did a 180 on the earlier defense of him, never mentioning the supposed approaches by Western intelligence or why those spy agencies might be interested in their client.\nSo the trial never detailed who Klyushin‚Äôs investors were‚Äîfolks like Aleksandr Borodaev and Boris Varshavskiy, the guy who won the Russian gold medal for mining. Nor did the trial lay out how many Russians benefited from the scheme. It neglected to mention that when Klyushin shared photographs with Ermakov in August 2019 of a safe filled with $3 million in $100 bills, that safe was located inside the Russian Ministry of Defense.\nThe trial was over in 16 days. Klyushin was found guilty on all charges. Not that he seemed to care.\nIn 2022, the American and Russian governments swapped two sets of prisoners. They traded Konstantin Yaro-shenko, a Russian drug smuggler, for Trevor Reed, and they swapped Viktor Bout, the weapons trader known as the ‚ÄúMerchant of Death,‚Äù for the American basketball player Brittney Griner.\nBout was a real-life supervillain, fueling conflicts from Afghanistan to Angola. Yaroshenko had agreed to smuggle 8,800 pounds of cocaine. Griner, on the other hand, had been held for the better part of a year for possession of less than a gram of hash oil. Reed was falsely accused of hitting a Russian cop one time. Of course, everyone was happy to see wrongly detained American civilians let go. But what message did it send to Putin, that he could trade Bout‚Äôs freedom for Griner‚Äôs? Yaroshenko‚Äôs for Reed‚Äôs? Doug London, a 34-year veteran of the CIA, says that while the trade was politically popular, it may not have been in the US‚Äôs long-term interest. ‚ÄúRussia was emboldened by this,‚Äù he tells me. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just going to take more hostages, and they‚Äôre just going to arrest more people.‚Äù\nKlyushin was convicted on Valentine‚Äôs Day, 2023. About six weeks later, on March 29, Russian authorities effectively kidnapped Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, and accused him of being a spy. A worldwide outcry ensued. So did talks to make a trade that could bring him home.\nDepending on whom you believe, Klyushin was frequently discussed as the negotiators met along their various tracks‚Äîor he wasn‚Äôt mentioned at all. The Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was deeply involved, or had nothing whatsoever to do with any talks. The State Department was stitching an international coalition to free the next set of Western prisoners, or was spinning its wheels on the margins. The CIA was leading the talks on the American side, or, as one of 10 sources put it, merely ‚Äúdelivering the mail‚Äù for the Biden White House, which was calling all the shots. Making matters even more complex: Many of the 24 people who were eventually freed in August‚Äôs massive prisoner exchange had their own advocates, all trying to negotiate with governments and with one another. One American prisoner even had two sets of representatives, each of which shit-talked the other to me.\nThe CIA and the White House declined to comment on the record for this story. The State Department‚Äîwhose top official for hostage affairs is so far from camera-shy that he once starred on a reality show‚Äîdeclined, as well. But after speaking to my sources and reading through the various official leaks, a few common threads emerged. Putin‚Äôs top priority, by far, was to get back another one of his killers: a hit man named Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence for carrying out an assassination in Berlin. (According to Gershkovich, Putin‚Äôs Department for Counterintelligence Operations deliberately ‚Äúused‚Äù him and Whelan as trade bait to secure the release of Krasikov.) The Germans were open to it, if some high-profile Russian dissidents were freed. The Russians would agree to that if more of their operatives were released, like that deep-undercover couple in Slovenia‚Äîand Klyushin.\nIt‚Äôs not hard to see why; Klyushin was a key contractor for Putin‚Äôs propaganda chief, so valued he got a medal from the Russian president himself. Additional hints of Klyushin‚Äôs value emerged in the months following his conviction, if you knew where to look. Klyushin‚Äôs friends Borodaev and Varshavskiy, the mining types, were put on the US sanctions list as part of the effort to ‚Äúcurtail Russia‚Äôs ability to exploit the international financial system.‚Äù Then there‚Äôs the broad array of unnamed Russian nationals who benefited from the M13 operation, and the mysterious Russian government official whose safe Klyushin filled up with $100 bills. Take a half-step back, and it‚Äôs plain that M13‚Äôs hack-and-trade effort was part of an attempt to fund Moscow‚Äôs economy through the back door, despite every US effort to shut it.\nOn July 31, 2024, an official Kremlin news service reported that Klyushin had suddenly gone missing from a US prison database, along with three other Russian nationals. Two of the Russians‚Äîa hacker and an electronics smuggler‚Äîwere soon back behind bars. Klyushin and two others were loaded on a plane by men in baseball hats and balaclavas and were flown first to Ankara, then to Moscow. Meanwhile, Whelan, Gershkovich, and the other prisoners held in Russia were met in a tearful, triumphant scene at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland by family, colleagues, Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris. ‚ÄúI had on clothes that I had worn in 2018 when I‚Äôd been arrested. You know, they hadn‚Äôt been washed. They were too big for me,‚Äù Whelan told CBS.\n‚ÄúI waved at people that were waving at me, and then I gave the president a salute as the commander in chief.‚Äù Whelan continued. ‚ÄúI thanked him for getting us home.‚Äù\nWatching from afar, Frank admitted to feeling just the tiniest bit conflicted amid the rapture of seeing Whelan and Gershkovich, the best-known of the freed American prisoners, back on US soil. ‚ÄúI was a reporter, and to have a fellow reporter held hostage like that, it‚Äôs pretty horrendous. And so I think we were thrilled to have a role in creating the opportunity for him to come home. On the flip side of that, it‚Äôs a guy who‚Äôs actually a criminal‚Äù‚ÄîKlyushin‚Äî‚Äúgoing free to get people out who are completely innocent. I think we were gratified that he spent three years in jail at least before he went back,‚Äù says Frank, who recently joined a business litigation firm. ‚ÄúBut yeah, there‚Äôs obviously a little bit of a mix of emotion.‚Äù\nIn the images of his arrival at Vnukovo Airport, in Moscow, the man Frank chased for the better part of three years looks exhausted, with deep circles under his eyes and his brown hair largely turned to gray. His 5 o‚Äôclock shadow is now well past 7:30. Wearing an open-collared khaki shirt and matching pants, Vladislav Klyushin descends the stairs stiffly. He waits for the undercover couple and their kids to receive flower bouquets. Then Klyushin shakes the hand of Vladimir Putin, who gives him a one-armed embrace.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

The judge in his case had brushed aside his lawyers‚Äô arguments and his friends‚Äô appeals for leniency. She handed down a tough sentence: nine more years in US federal prison, on top of an order to forfeit a fortune, $34 million.</p><p class=\"paywall\">But if Klyushin was upset about the ruling, he didn‚Äôt show it. The then 42-year-old tech executive from Moscow seemed upbeat‚Äîquick with a smile on his pinchable cheeks and unerringly polite, just as he had been during his arrest near a Swiss ski resort in March 2021, his months of detention in Switzerland, his extradition to the United States that December, his indictment and trial on hacking and wire fraud charges, and his swift conviction. Klyushin ‚Äúhad a confidence all along that eventually the Russians would get him back,‚Äù one of his defense attorneys told me. He seemed certain that his protectors in the Kremlin would spare him from serving out his full sentence.</p><p class=\"paywall\">There were times when that certainty seemed cocksure. America‚Äôs federal prison system held 35 Russian nationals. Surely not all of them were getting traded back. His family and friends were distraught. Within less than a year, though, Klyushin was proven right. On August 1, 2024, he was unshackled and put on a plane back to Moscow‚Äîone of the 24 people involved in the largest, most complex US-Russian prisoner exchange ever.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">You probably heard something <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/russia-cybercriminal-us-prisoner-swap/\">about the swap</a>. It‚Äôs the one that brought Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan home to the United States‚Äîand sent back to Russia a Kremlin-linked assassin and a husband-and-wife duo of spies who were so deep undercover that their kids didn‚Äôt learn they were Russian until they got on the plane. In coverage of the exchange, Klyushin was treated as a footnote. That was a mistake, if an understandable one. And not just because he was at the center of one of the bigger insider trading cases of all time.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">The escalating conflict between the US and Russia has played out in all sorts of ways over the past decade. One American captive was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-20ab40d17f8a9b4abf9b3498da979859\" target=\"_blank\">swapped</a> just two weeks ago; <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/who-are-americans-imprisoned-russia-2025-02-12/\" target=\"_blank\">at least 10 more US citizens</a> remain imprisoned in Russia. And now, there‚Äôs a Kremlin-friendly occupant of the Oval Office, one who loves to be seen as making deals. One is in global financial markets, with America and its allies walling more and more of Russian industry off from the international economy. There are always creative individuals who can find cracks in that wall, though, and Klyushin sure seems to have been one of them. You don‚Äôt have to squint too hard to see his scheme‚Äîwhich ultimately netted $93 million‚Äîas a way to bring capital into Russia, despite the global blockade. The contest has also been evident on the streets of Moscow, where a secretive Kremlin security force has grabbed American citizens, who are charged with bogus crimes, and then dangled them in trades for killers, spies, and associates of the Kremlin. It‚Äôs kidnapping, hostage taking, and it‚Äôs effectively all being done on President <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/vladimir-putin/\">Vladimir Putin</a>‚Äôs orders. Oftentimes, Americans are taken precisely for their value as assets to be later exchanged‚Äîto get back people like that assassin, or this financial crook, Klyushin. He wasn‚Äôt at the very top of Moscow‚Äôs trade list. But Klyushin was much closer, and more important to the Kremlin, than either side was willing to admit.</p><div class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe cAjMFL callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Illustration: Vartika Sharma</span></p></figure></div><p class=\"paywall\"><span class=\"lead-in-text-callout\">To the outside</span> world, Klyushin had a rags-to-riches, fairy-tale life, with a gauzy wedding video to prove it. In a montage later obtained by US prosecutors, Klyushin dives into a country club pool; his bride-to-be, Zhannetta, sips pink champagne on an outdoor bed draped with chiffon and roses; he picks her up in a white Porsche convertible; she‚Äôs gorgeous in her backless gown; he‚Äôs handsome, if a little goofy, in his tux and subtle mullet; they dance and laugh and stare meaningfully at the fireworks punctuating the perfect night. ‚ÄúI do not know a more decent person than my husband,‚Äù Zhannetta later wrote to the judge in his case.</p><p class=\"paywall\">They had three children, adding to the two Klyushin had from a previous marriage. By all accounts, he was a doting father, a far cry from his own, a man he never met, or his stepfather, who was killed during a car robbery when Klyushin was 14. He emerged from a childhood of poverty to build a number of businesses. First, he was in construction and marketing; later, he ran an IT company called M13, which sold media- and internet-monitoring software to Russian government agencies. Early customers in 2016 included the Ministry of Defense and the office of the presidential administration, where Putin‚Äôs propaganda chief became an important proponent of M13. The company‚Äôs software was used to keep tabs on hundreds of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/pavel-durov-arrest-telegram-content-moderation/\">Telegram</a> channels for a Kremlin worried about the ‚Äúintroduction of unverified or knowingly false information,‚Äù according to one local news report.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Klyushin‚Äôs rise was rapid, taking in more than $30 million in government contracts in a decade. That confounded some of his professional peers. (‚ÄúThe company and its owner are unknown to most in the IT community,‚Äù a respected Russian business journal noted in 2021.) But it brought him influence and admirers. He supported the arts and rebuilt the roof of the monastery on Moscow‚Äôs Lubyanka Street, a few blocks down from the headquarters of Russia‚Äôs spy service, the FSB. One friend later hailed Klyushin as an ‚Äúeco-activist‚Äù (for planting ‚Äúseveral spruces in the yard‚Äù) and a ‚Äúpet-lover‚Äù (his ‚Äúfavourite pet is a dog‚Äù). ‚ÄúBroad-minded, well-read, educated,‚Äù gushed his family friend and tennis coach. An M13 employee said that a conversation with Klyushin ‚Äúis like getting a lesson from a guru.‚Äù</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Dan Bongino has spent the last decade building a career in right-wing media based on his sycophantic support of President Donald Trump and his willingness to engage in endless conspiracy theories about everything from Covid-19 and the 2020 elections to the FBI, which he has said should no longer exist in its current form.\n‚ÄúThe FBI is no longer a law enforcement entity,‚Äù Bongino wrote on X in 2023. ‚ÄúIt is an oppo research firm for Democrats with an armed political enforcement branch.‚Äù He also wrote previously that he wants to ‚Äúdisband the FBI‚Äù and boosted conspiracy theories about its role in the Capitol insurrection. ‚ÄúI don't trust these people at all,‚Äù Bongino wrote under a Facebook video about the agency last year.\nOn Sunday night, Trump announced on Truth Social that Bongino had been appointed as the agency‚Äôs deputy director.\nBongino, who previously served as a police officer in New York and as a Secret Service agent protecting former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, has no FBI experience‚Äîa trait he shares with Kash Patel, the QAnon-promoting Trump loyalist who was last week confirmed as the new director of the FBI.\nThe deputy director role, which oversees day-to-day operations of the bureau, has typically gone to an experienced FBI agent. In January, after he was nominated but before he was confirmed by the Senate, Patel met with two senior members of the FBI Agents Association, and, Patel ‚Äúprivately agreed‚Äù that ‚Äúthe FBI Deputy Director should continue to be an on-board, active Special Agent‚Äîas has been the case for 117 years for many compelling reasons.‚Äù\nThis information was shared with the associations‚Äô members in a memo sent on Sunday evening, an hour before Trump announced Bongino‚Äôs appointment, according to a copy of the newsletter reviewed by WIRED.\n‚ÄúThere is a ton of concern that someone with no experience in the Bureau is appointed to, in the view of agents, a position that is even more important than the director,‚Äù one member of the association told WIRED. The person was granted anonymity over fears of recrimination from the new FBI leadership.\nNeither the FBI Agents Association nor a spokesperson for Patel immediately responded to a request for comment.\nBongino is a Trump loyalist who has in the past referred to the president as ‚Äúan apex predator.‚Äù A three-time failed congressional candidate, he has risen from the fringes of the online conspiracy community to become one of the most prominent voices in right-wing media, leveraging online platforms, as well as appearances on Fox News, to push wild conspiracy theories about the agency he will now help to oversee and about the government generally. (He has written a book called Follow the Money: The Shocking Deep State Connections of the Anti-Trump Cabal.) A claimed proponent of free speech, Bongino is prone to rants and tirades against anyone who criticizes him, and he regularly blocks his critics on social media.\n‚ÄúDan Bongino is a Trump sycophant whose focus has been delegitimizing any and all legal steps taken against the president and his allies,‚Äù Matt Gertz, a senior fellow at media watchdog Media Matters who has tracked Bongino‚Äôs career closely, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúBongino‚Äôs appointment hammers home that Trump is building a federal law enforcement team that will carry out his desires to punish his political enemies: You don‚Äôt select a bomb-throwing podcaster who has declared that ‚Äòowning the libs‚Äô is his sole focus in life to help run the FBI if you‚Äôre aiming for an impartial bureau.‚Äù\nBongino served full-time in the NYPD from 1997 to 1999 before joining the Secret Service.\nHe left in 2011 to pursue a political career, running for Senate as a Republican in Maryland in 2012. At the time, his opinion of his former employer was still very positive.\n‚ÄúThe president was a wonderful guy,‚Äù Bongino said of Obama in 2011. ‚ÄúFrom what I saw he was a wonderful father and a wonderful man and he was very, very nice and very kind to me.‚Äù In a memoir published in 2013, Bongino added that Obama was ‚Äúone of a group of men I would have gladly sacrificed my life for.‚Äù\nAround the same time, though, Bongino began to take his first steps on a path that would ultimately lead him to becoming one of the biggest podcasters in the US.\nIn 2013 he appeared on Infowars, where he spoke to Alex Jones about the then recent shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. After Jones said it‚Äôs ‚Äúso over-the-top how authoritarian the Democrats have become‚Äù in response to school shootings, Bongino replied that Democrats aren‚Äôt crisis managers but are instead ‚Äúcrisis-leveraging [and] using a national emotional crisis to get you to believe things that simply aren‚Äôt true.‚Äù\nA decade later Jones would be ordered by a court to liquidate his assets to pay the families of the victims of the shooting $1.5 billion.\nBongino made multiple appearances on Jones‚Äô show in the run-up to his second failed congressional tilt in 2014, this time losing to incumbent Democratic representative John Delaney in Maryland‚Äôs 6th Congressional District.\nDuring one of his Infowars appearances, Bongino boosted the conspiracy theory that CIA agents were told to stand down during the terrorist attacks on the US Special Mission and Annex in Benghazi, Libya.\nBongino began his own podcast, The Dan Bongino Show, in 2015, and a year later made his third attempt at winning a seat in Congress, this time in Florida‚Äôs 19th Congressional District. Just a week before the vote, Bongino was recorded having a full-on meltdown while speaking to a reporter from Politico, whom he called ‚Äúa real disgusting piece of shit.‚Äù\nIn 2018 Bongino was handed his own 30-minute show on the National Rifle Association‚Äôs station, NRATV. Bongino used his show to continuously hammer the work being conducted by special counsel‚Äîand former FBI director‚ÄîRobert Mueller, who was at the time investigating Trump and allegations that Russia interfered with the 2016 election.\nBongino pushed the conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign was being spied on, a situation he dubbed ‚Äúspygate‚Äù and called ‚Äúthe biggest scandal in American history.‚Äù\nDuring one show, discussing the pushback against the nomination of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, Bongino said, ‚ÄúMy entire life right now is about owning the libs. That‚Äôs it. The libs ‚Ä¶ have shown themselves through this Kavanaugh abomination of a process to be ‚Ä¶ pure unadulterated evil.‚Äù\nHis robust defense of Trump caught the attention of producers at Fox, who booked him hundreds of times during this period, and it appears to be at this point that Trump first took notice of Bongino.\nIn June 2018, Trump quoted Bongino in two posts on Twitter after Bongino appeared on Fox & Friends slamming then CIA director John Brennan.\nBongino connected with Trump, the Daily Beast reported in October 2018, writing that Trump spoke to his aides about ‚Äúmalicious influences inside the FBI,‚Äù citing Bongino as the source of his information.\nBongino‚Äôs NRATV show lasted less than a year, and in December 2018 when it was announced his show was ending, Bongino reacted to critics saying he had been fired and poking fun at his demise.\nA month later, Fox News signed Bongino as a contributor, despite the fact that he had been reportedly barred from the set of Shannon Bream‚Äôs show on the station for becoming ‚Äúunglued‚Äù during a recording.\nIn 2021, Bongino became a Fox News host, with a Saturday night show called Unfiltered, which he used to become one of the loudest voices pushing election-denial conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. He also used the platform to push the great replacement conspiracy theory and Covid-19 conspiracy theories. Bongino regularly railed against what he considered to be government overreach in relation to mask and vaccine mandates.\nDuring the attack on the Capitol, Bongino was temporarily suspended from Twitter for posting a video originally shared by Trump, and in the days after the attack he raged about the decision to remove the messaging app Parler, in which he was an investor, from app stores.\nIn 2022, YouTube finally took action against Bongino, who used to post his podcast on the platform, permanently banning him for spreading Covid-19 disinformation. However Facebook continued to allow him to use its platform, where he had built up a massive audience, to promote his conspiracy theories.\nBongino left Fox News in 2023, but he has continued to grow his podcast on the alternative video streaming site Rumble, to which Vice President JD Vance has ties and in which he is an investor.\nWhile Bongino has not been as vocal a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory as his boss, he has boosted QAnon figures in the past, and his supporters on pro-Trump and conspiracy channels have been cheering his new role. These supporters claim that he and Patel will finally unmask the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù‚Äîa supposed group of government officials they believe have been waging a secret war on Trump.\n‚ÄúTrump has brought together the dream team, the Avengers,‚Äù one prominent QAnon promoter wrote. ‚ÄúGet your popcorn ready.‚Äù\nUpdate 2/24/25 5:53pm ET: This story has been updated with additional information about the FBI Agents Association's view of the Bongino appointment.",

    "content_text": "Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company founded by exiles from OpenAI, has introduced the first AI model that can produce either conventional output or a controllable amount of ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù needed to solve more grueling problems.\nAnthropic says the new hybrid model, called Claude 3.7, will make it easier for users and developers to tackle problems that require a mix of instinctive output and step-by-step cogitation. ‚ÄúThe [user] has a lot of control over the behavior‚Äîhow long it thinks, and can trade reasoning and intelligence with time and budget,‚Äù says Michael Gerstenhaber, product lead, AI platform at Anthropic.\nClaude 3.7 also features a new ‚Äúscratchpad‚Äù that reveals the model‚Äôs reasoning process. A similar feature proved popular with the Chinese AI model DeepSeek. It can help a user understand how a model is working over a problem in order to modify or refine prompts.\nDianne Penn, product lead of research at Anthropic, says the scratchpad is even more helpful when combined with the ability to ratchet a model‚Äôs ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù up and down. If, for example, the model struggles to break down a problem correctly, a user can ask it to spend more time working on it.\nFrontier AI companies are increasingly focused on getting the models to ‚Äúreason‚Äù over problems as a way to increase their capabilities and broaden their usefulness. OpenAI, the company that kicked off the current AI boom with ChatGPT, was the first to offer a reasoning AI model, called o1, in September 2024. OpenAI has since introduced a more powerful version called o3, while rival Google has released a similar offering for its model Gemini, called Flash Thinking. In both cases, users have to switch between models to access the reasoning abilities‚Äîa key difference compared to Claude 3.7.\nThe difference between a conventional model and a reasoning one is similar to the two types of thinking described by the Nobel-prize-winning economist Michael Kahneman in his 2011 book Thinking Fast and Slow: fast and instinctive System-1 thinking and slower more deliberative System-2 thinking.\nThe kind of model that made ChatGPT possible, known as a large language model or LLM, produces instantaneous responses to a prompt by querying a large neural network. These outputs can be strikingly clever and coherent but may fail to answer questions that require step-by-step reasoning, including simple arithmetic.\nAn LLM can be forced to mimic deliberative reasoning if it is instructed to come up with a plan that it must then follow. This trick is not always reliable, however, and models typically struggle to solve problems that require extensive, careful planning. OpenAI, Google, and now Anthropic are all using a machine learning method known as reinforcement learning to get their latest models to learn to generate reasoning that points toward correct answers. This requires gathering additional training data from humans on solving specific problems.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Do you work at an artificial intelligence company and have a tip to share? Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Will Knight at wak.01 on Signal.\nPenn says that Claude‚Äôs reasoning mode received additional data on business applications including writing and fixing code, using computers, and answering complex legal questions. ‚ÄúThe things that we made improvements on are ‚Ä¶ technical subjects or subjects which require long reasoning,‚Äù Penn says. ‚ÄúWhat we have from our customers is a lot of interest in deploying our models into their actual workloads.‚Äù\nAnthropic says that Claude 3.7 is especially good at solving coding problems that require step-by-step reasoning, outscoring OpenAI‚Äôs o1 on some benchmarks like SWE-bench. The company is today releasing a new tool, called Claude Code, specifically designed for this kind of AI-assisted coding.\n‚ÄúThe model is already good at coding,‚Äù Penn says. But ‚Äúadditional thinking would be good for cases that might require very complex planning‚Äîsay you‚Äôre looking at an extremely large code base for a company.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "In late January, a warning spread through the London-based Facebook group Are We Dating the Same Guy?‚Äîbut this post wasn‚Äôt about a bad date or a cheating ex. A connected network of male-dominated Telegram groups had surfaced, sharing and circulating nonconsensual intimate images of women. Their justification? Retaliation.\nOn January 23, users in the AWDTSG Facebook group began warning about hidden Telegram groups. Screenshots and TikTok videos surfaced, revealing public Telegram channels where users were sharing nonconsensual intimate images. Further investigation by WIRED identified additional channels linked to the network. By scraping thousands of messages from these groups, it became possible to analyze their content and the patterns of abuse.\nAWDTSG, a sprawling web of over 150 regional forums across Facebook alone, with roughly 3 million members worldwide, was designed by Paola Sanchez in 2022 in New York as a space for women to share warnings about predatory men. But its rapid growth made it a target. Critics argue that the format allows unverified accusations to spiral. Some men have responded with at least three defamation lawsuits filed in recent years against members, administrators, and even Meta, Facebook‚Äôs parent company. Others took a different route: organized digital harassment.\nPrimarily using Telegram group data made available through Telemetr.io, a Telegram analytics tool, WIRED analyzed more than 3,500 messages from a Telegram group linked to a larger misogynistic revenge network. Over 24 hours, WIRED observed users systematically tracking, doxing, and degrading women from AWDTSG, circulating nonconsensual images, phone numbers, usernames, and location data.\nFrom January 26 to 27, the chats became a breeding ground for misogynistic, racist, sexual digital abuse of women, with women of color bearing the brunt of the targeted harassment and abuse. Thousands of users encouraged each other to share nonconsensual intimate images, often referred to as ‚Äúrevenge porn,‚Äù and requested and circulated women‚Äôs phone numbers, usernames, locations, and other personal identifiers.\nAs women from AWDTSG began infiltrating the Telegram group, at least one user grew suspicious: ‚ÄúThese lot just tryna get back at us for exposing them.‚Äù\nWhen women on Facebook tried to alert others of the risk of doxing and leaks of their intimate content, AWDTSG moderators removed their posts. (The group‚Äôs moderators did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) Meanwhile, men who had previously coordinated through their own Facebook groups like ‚ÄúAre We Dating the Same Girl‚Äù shifted their operations in late January to Telegram's more permissive environment. Their message was clear: If they can do it, so can we.\n\"In the eyes of some of these men, this is a necessary act of defense against a kind of hostile feminism that they believe is out to ruin their lives,\" says Carl Miller, cofounder of the Center for the Analysis of Social Media and host of the podcast Kill List.\nThe dozen Telegram groups that WIRED has identified are part of a broader digital ecosystem often referred to as the manosphere, an online network of forums, influencers, and communities that perpetuate misogynistic ideologies.\n‚ÄúHighly isolated online spaces start reinforcing their own worldviews, pulling further and further from the mainstream, and in doing so, legitimizing things that would be unthinkable offline,‚Äù Miller says. ‚ÄúEventually, what was once unthinkable becomes the norm.‚Äù\nThis cycle of reinforcement plays out across multiple platforms. Facebook forums act as the first point of contact, TikTok amplifies the rhetoric in publicly available videos, and Telegram is used to enable illicit activity. The result? A self-sustaining network of harassment that thrives on digital anonymity.\nTikTok amplified discussions around the Telegram groups. WIRED reviewed 12 videos in which creators, of all genders, discussed, joked about, or berated the Telegram groups. In the comments section of these videos, users shared invitation links to public and private groups and some public channels on Telegram, making them accessible to a wider audience. While TikTok was not the primary platform for harassment, discussions about the Telegram groups spread there, and in some cases users explicitly acknowledged their illegality.\nTikTok tells WIRED that its Community Guidelines prohibit image-based sexual abuse, sexual harassment, and nonconsensual sexual acts, and that violations result in removals and possible account bans. They also stated that TikTok removes links directing people to content that violates its policies and that it continues to invest in Trust and Safety operations.\nIntentionally or not, the algorithms powering social media platforms like Facebook can amplify misogynistic content. Hate-driven engagement fuels growth, pulling new users into these communities through viral trends, suggested content, and comment-section recruitment.\nAs people caught notice on Facebook and TikTok and started reporting the Telegram groups, they didn‚Äôt disappear‚Äîthey simply rebranded. Reactionary groups quickly emerged, signaling that members knew they were being watched but had no intention of stopping. Inside, messages revealed a clear awareness of the risks: Users knew they were breaking the law. They just didn‚Äôt care, according to chat logs reviewed by WIRED. To absolve themselves, one user wrote, ‚ÄúI do not condone im [simply] here to regulate rules,‚Äù while another shared a link to a statement that said: ‚ÄúI am here for only entertainment purposes only and I don‚Äôt support any illegal activities.‚Äù\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment.\nMessages from the Telegram group WIRED analyzed show that some chats became hyper-localized, dividing London into four regions to make harassment even more targeted. Members casually sought access to other city-based groups: ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs got brum link?‚Äù and ‚ÄúManny link tho?‚Äù‚ÄîBritish slang referring to Birmingham and Manchester. They weren‚Äôt just looking for gossip. ‚ÄúAny info from west?‚Äù one user asked, while another requested, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs her @?‚Äù‚Äî hunting for a woman‚Äôs social media handle, a first step to tracking her online activity.\nThe chat logs further reveal how women were discussed as commodities. ‚ÄúShe a freak, I‚Äôll give her that,‚Äù one user wrote. Another added, ‚ÄúBeautiful. Hide her from me.‚Äù Others encouraged sharing explicit material: ‚ÄúSharing is caring, don‚Äôt be greedy.‚Äù\nMembers also bragged about sexual exploits, using coded language to reference encounters in specific locations, and spread degrading, racial abuse, predominantly targeting Black women.\nOnce a woman was mentioned, her privacy was permanently compromised. Users frequently shared social media handles, which led other members to contact her‚Äîsoliciting intimate images or sending disparaging texts.\nAnonymity can be a protective tool for women navigating online harassment. But it can also be embraced by bad actors who use the same structures to evade accountability.\n\"It‚Äôs ironic,\" Miller says. \"The very privacy structures that women use to protect themselves are being turned against them.\"\nThe rise of unmoderated spaces like the abusive Telegram groups makes it nearly impossible to trace perpetrators, exposing a systemic failure in law enforcement and regulation. Without clear jurisdiction or oversight, platforms are able to sidestep accountability.\nSophie Mortimer, manager of the UK-based Revenge Porn Helpline, warned that Telegram has become one of the biggest threats to online safety. She says that the UK charity‚Äôs reports to Telegram of nonconsensual intimate image abuse are ignored. ‚ÄúWe would consider them to be noncompliant to our requests,‚Äù she says. Telegram, however, says it received only ‚Äúabout 10 piece of content‚Äù from the Revenge Porn Helpline, ‚Äúall of which were removed.‚Äù Mortimer did not yet respond to WIRED‚Äôs questions about the veracity of Telegram‚Äôs claims.\nDespite recent updates to the UK‚Äôs Online Safety Act, legal enforcement of online abuse remains weak. An October 2024 report from the UK-based charity The Cyber Helpline shows that cybercrime victims face significant barriers in reporting abuse, and justice for online crimes is seven times less likely than for offline crimes.\n\"There‚Äôs still this long-standing idea that cybercrime doesn‚Äôt have real consequences,\" says Charlotte Hooper, head of operations of The Cyber Helpline, which helps support victims of cybercrime. \"But if you look at victim studies, cybercrime is just as‚Äîif not more‚Äîpsychologically damaging than physical crime.\"\nA Telegram spokesperson tells WIRED that its moderators use ‚Äúcustom AI and machine learning tools‚Äù to remove content that violates the platform's rules, ‚Äúincluding nonconsensual pornography and doxing.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAs a result of Telegram's proactive moderation and response to reports, moderators remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day,‚Äù the spokesperson says.\nHooper says that survivors of digital harassment often change jobs, move cities, or even retreat from public life due to the trauma of being targeted online. The systemic failure to recognize these cases as serious crimes allows perpetrators to continue operating with impunity.\nYet, as these networks grow more interwoven, social media companies have failed to adequately address gaps in moderation.\nTelegram, despite its estimated 950 million monthly active users worldwide, claims it‚Äôs too small to qualify as a ‚ÄúVery Large Online Platform‚Äù under the European Union‚Äôs Digital Service Act, allowing it to sidestep certain regulatory scrutiny. ‚ÄúTelegram takes its responsibilities under the DSA seriously and is in constant communication with the European Commission,‚Äù a company spokesperson said.\nIn the UK, several civil society groups have expressed concern about the use of large private Telegram groups, which allow up to 200,000 members. These groups exploit a loophole by operating under the guise of ‚Äúprivate‚Äù communication to circumvent legal requirements for removing illegal content, including nonconsensual intimate images.\nWithout stronger regulation, online abuse will continue to evolve, adapting to new platforms and evading scrutiny.\nThe digital spaces meant to safeguard privacy are now incubating its most invasive violations. These networks aren‚Äôt just growing‚Äîthey‚Äôre adapting, spreading across platforms, and learning how to evade accountability.",

    "content_text": "The first time that MBox ever went speeding around Times Square in New York City, he didn‚Äôt know it was going to change his life.\nHe had slipped into the car of his friend, a driver known online as Squeeze or Squeeze.benz, who MBox says was 21 years old‚Äîand set off for a drive in the early hours of the morning. The duo was armed with nothing but a camera, Squeeze‚Äôs BMW, and the shared desire to ‚Äúgo viral.‚Äù\nThe video they ended up filming that night shows them running red lights, narrowly avoiding scrapes with other cars, doing doughnuts at intersections, and even driving backward up a one-way street, all at high speeds. After being posted to YouTube last year, the footage was viewed more than 11 million times. It seemed their brand was on the rise‚Äîat least until the New York Police Department got involved.\nOn May 21, the department's deputy commissioner of operations, Kaz Daughtry, proudly posted on X that the NYPD had ‚ÄúSqueeze.benz‚Äù in custody. Authorities cited his reckless driving, including outracing police. But when the NYPD charged Antonio Ginestri, 19 at the time and linked to the social media account in a New York Post report, the offense was third-degree assault, which law enforcement said stemmed from an unrelated incident several months prior. \"One of the most prolific street racers in NYC can no longer treat the Big Apple like the Indy 500,\" Daughtry claimed.\nThere‚Äôs just one problem: MBox swears that the NYPD implicated the wrong guy as Squeeze.\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even want to get too much into that, but that was somebody else. They don‚Äôt have the real Squeeze,‚Äù MBox, an up-and-coming rapper in his mid-twenties who claims to be Squeeze‚Äôs ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù and interpreter, alleges to me via a Discord voice call. (MBox, like other YouTubers WIRED interviewed for this story, declined to give any identifying details.) ‚ÄúThe real Squeeze is right next to me‚Äîhe hasn‚Äôt been publicly identified.‚Äù\nIt would be easy to write this all off as bravado from a bunch of high-speed clout chasers, except for one thing: In September, more than three months after Ginestri‚Äôs arrest, while he was still in custody, a new video appeared on the Squeeze.Benz YouTube channel. It showed footage of several vehicles‚Äîone purportedly being driven by Squeeze‚Äîdrifting and doing doughnuts in the center of Columbus Circle and Times Square, surrounded by pedestrians they narrowly missed hitting with their convoy of cars.\nIt is one of a barrage of clips uploaded to the channel, which has more than 735,000 subscribers and features video after video of high-speed, palm-sweat-inducing jaunts around New York City. Together, MBox and Squeeze have amassed an enormous fan base of car enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies‚Äîand set the scene for YouTube‚Äôs riskiest new niche: ‚Äúswimmers‚Äù who weave through traffic at breakneck speeds.\nThe trend, partly driven by the lure of internet clout and social media fame, has become a focal point for the NYPD, who seem determined to stamp out the practice. Now, the drivers swear they have plans to go legit‚Äîbefore they get arrested, or worse.\nDrag races and highway takeovers have long been a tradition in New York City. Their roots can be traced back to the 1960s era of muscle cars and street racing, which used to occur on the city‚Äôs Brooklyn-Queens Connecting Highway. At the time the New York Daily News called it ‚Äúa strip racer‚Äôs dream.‚Äù\nMost of YouTube‚Äôs reckless drivers exist on the fringes of this illegal scene, although their viral videos focus on something entirely different: ‚Äúswimming.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the craziest experience I could ever describe in my entire life,‚Äù says MBox, who likened these journeys to an out-of-body experience. ‚ÄúMaybe like skydiving, or fucking being in a shootout.‚Äù\nAccording to New York City scene veteran Rafael Estevez‚Äîthe main source for the 1998 Vibe magazine article ‚ÄúRacer X,‚Äù which later inspired the Fast and Furious franchise‚Äîswimming is a common practice among street racers, who are desensitized to driving at high speeds. ‚ÄúYou feel so confident behind the wheel that you‚Äôre able to do that. What people might look at as, wow, it‚Äôs impossible to do, for you it‚Äôs easy because you have total control of the vehicle. Or at least you think you do,‚Äù says Estevez, who is in his late-fifties and now runs Drag Racing Technologies body shop in New Jersey.\nThe only difference between Estevez‚Äôs generation and today‚Äôs YouTube drivers is that they are documenting their journeys from A to B, rather than street racing, as a way to make income without much extra effort.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just driving. We drive like this everywhere, all day,‚Äù says Float, an NYC-based driver from Team Swim, a collective that posts their exploits to YouTube. (Float tells WIRED he works in ‚Äúsales‚Äù and that the nature of his job requires him to travel from place to place at high speeds; he refused to share any personal information about himself.) ‚ÄúThe cameras just started coming into play because we might as well just record it.‚Äù\nOf course, not everyone is an enthusiastic consumer of illegal driving content. New Yorkers reported more than 1,200 drag racing incidents in 2024, compared to 127 reports in all of 2010. The situation has become so bad that in January 2024 the NYPD said it would launch a special task force to tackle the issue of reckless driving.\n‚ÄúNYers are fed up and tired with drag racers terrorizing our neighborhoods. It won‚Äôt be tolerated,‚Äù Daughtry wrote in an Instagram post in April of last year. ‚ÄúThinking of putting lives at risk for cheap thrills? Guess what‚Äîwe will seize your vehicle. We outside too!‚Äù\nThen there‚Äôs YouTube itself, which removed several videos after WIRED reached out seeking comment for this story. ‚ÄúYouTube prohibits videos that encourage dangerous or illegal activities,‚Äù says YouTube spokesperson Boot Bullwinkle.\nIn November, a 25-year-old influencer named Andre Beadle, who was known for his street racing videos on YouTube and Instagram, died when, police say, he crashed his BMW into a metal pole on a New York expressway.\nDespite the risk of arrest, drivers with heavy YouTube presences seem to enjoy antagonizing law enforcement. Videos with titles like ‚ÄúGoing Ghost on 6 Cop Cars,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Most Wild Police Chase You Will Ever See,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDominican Demon vs. NYPD‚Äù are among the most popular videos of the genre.\nVloggers, however, insist the footage isn‚Äôt being created with the intent of aggravating the cops. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt seek out the police at all. I was never looking for the chases,‚Äù claims Bobby, a driver in his mid-twenties from Team Swim who goes by Wheres981 on YouTube. His two most popular videos, montages titled ‚ÄúAlmost Every Time I Ran From the Cops (Compilation)‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlmost Every Time I Ran From the Cops 2 (Compilation),‚Äù have been viewed more than 6 million times.\nMost YouTubers believe that the NYPD and other law enforcement are responsible for escalating street-racing scenarios, and they brazenly goad the police. In one YouTube video posted in July by an account with more than 150,000 subscribers, Squeeze ‚Äúsees a cop and can't help himself,‚Äù according to the caption, and does several doughnuts around an idling Newark police car before speeding away. The stunt, which occurred next to the city's Prudential Center, was cited by the Newark Department of Public Safety at the time of Ginestri's arrest; he was charged with one count of eluding, saying the alleged incident happened in April.\nUntil the appointment of Jessica Tisch as NYPD commissioner late last year, there were no rules explicitly banning NYPD officers from pursuing dangerous drivers. Tisch has since announced a new police vehicle pursuit policy, which prohibits high-speed chases unless an individual is suspected of having committed a felony.\nMBox believes ‚Äúyou could definitely make a good, valid case that it‚Äôs way more selfish and egotistical of the police to pursue these young kids rather than just trying to call in their plates ‚Ä¶ or call in their car and then look for them when they‚Äôre parked up.‚Äù Estevez also thinks the police shouldn‚Äôt bother chasing young drivers. ‚ÄúThat is the biggest waste of time that the NYPD or any police department can do,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBecause that's not going to change; that's not going to stop anybody.‚Äù\nThe NYPD did not respond to requests for comment on this story and also wouldn‚Äôt comment on whether or not Ginestri is the driver they‚Äôve alleged is Squeeze.\nOf course, there is another thing standing in the way of these YouTubers‚Äô future: the funding of their cars. Some drivers, like Bobby, claim to use cryptocurrency to support their hobby; others, like Float, are more secretive about their sources of income. Although the pair presently use their everyday cars for racing and filming, further fame could increase the cost of participation if they don‚Äôt want to be arrested.\nTo prevent their own arrests, MBox and Squeeze have had to turn to concierge services‚Äî companies which own fleets of cars under an LLC‚Äîto rent their vehicles. ‚ÄúA lot of times they‚Äôll rent to us without any credentials‚Äîcredentials being license, insurance, and stuff like that,‚Äù MBox explains. Due to the pairs‚Äô ‚Äúconnections,‚Äù renting cars sets them back anywhere from $75 to $300 per day, although they once spent up to $10,000 renting a Lamborghini for a week.\nMBox claims he and Squeeze have managed to offset their rental costs by monetizing their YouTube channel‚Äîa tricky business that involves adding disclaimers that say the driving in their videos is done by ‚Äútrained professionals‚Äù (other street racing videos insist the footage was made using the 3D video game graphics tool Unreal Engine). Still, their clips don‚Äôt attract the kind of big-money payouts more brand-friendly content creators get. (According to YouTube, videos must abide by the company‚Äôs advertiser-friendly content guidelines.)\nStreet racers are also subject to deletion from social media companies‚ÄîMBox claims Squeeze‚Äôs Instagram account was bringing in around several thousand dollars a month for promotions, and even more from merchandise drops, before it was taken down‚Äîwhich makes it difficult to keep income consistent. Eventually, many hope to follow in the footsteps of influencer giants like Jake Paul or David Dobrik, who initially found fame by engaging in wild stunts before transitioning into more palatable creators for brands.\nBobby and Float‚Äôs Team Swim has started this process by setting up a pay-to-join server on the driving game Assetto Corsa. The server, which is overseen by the team‚Äôs technology officer, allows members‚Äîpaying fans and Team Swim drivers‚Äîto race against each other in real time. (Players can also employ special pedal sets and steering wheels, manufactured by brands like Hori and Logitech, which mimic the sensations drivers would feel in a real car.)\nThe group also hopes to expand to a new server on the Grand Theft Auto V mod FiveM, an online multiplayer game which allows for real-time role-play. ‚ÄúYou can race around the city and get chased by other players who are working as cops,‚Äù explains Rome, a 21-year-old racing enthusiast based in Switzerland who works with Team Swim remotely.\nTeam Swim hopes that setting up and playing on these will help them bond with the fans they race alongside and bring in money from membership fees, eventually negating any need for them to film videos. Video games also serve as a safety measure‚Äîthey can prevent their followers from engaging in IRL copycat behavior. ‚ÄúThere's a lot of young people that really like to watch videos like this online, and they look up to us,‚Äù says Bobby. If those fans can stream with Team Swim, Bobby says, ‚Äúand I'm [there] actively telling you not to do this, for some people that is enough.‚Äù\nMBox and Squeeze, however, have a different route, one that involves pouring money into Squeeze‚Äôs YouTube channel. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a bunch of GoPros, two 360 [cameras]‚Äîwe have the Ray-Ban Meta glasses. We have all that shit to make us a real, efficient camera crew,‚Äù MBox says. At present, all that capital is being poured into a new venture: creating a ‚Äúteam‚Äù of young, rookie drivers who have been specially recruited to drive like Squeeze.\nTeam members are expected to provide footage in exchange for use of MBox and Squeeze‚Äôs camera equipment and access to Squeeze‚Äôs 735,000 subscribers and brand. ‚ÄúThose are the kids that are going to be taking the automotive risks going forward,‚Äù MBox says, ‚Äúand Squeeze is going to be mainly doing more PR marketing stuff.‚Äù\nCurrently, Squeeze‚Äôs nonverbal PR presence feels akin to Top Gear‚Äôs silent, helmet-wearing driver The Stig, although there are plans for a face reveal later, when Squeeze‚Äôs brand is somewhat less illegal; according to MBox there will be more family-friendly go-karting and content vlogs in his future.\nIt‚Äôs not clear how financially viable that transition will be for either group. Bobby and Team Swim make ‚Äúa couple hundred dollars a month‚Äù at present from their videos due to advertising restrictions on their content; and their sales of server memberships and self-made merchandise have not yet resulted in any tangible profits. MBox and Squeeze have also faced similar issues and currently struggle to attract sponsorship or attention from brands, who are understandably reluctant to fund Squeeze‚Äôs illegal activity.\nMBox is hopeful that, as Squeeze himself moves away from lawbreaking content, they‚Äôll attract more attention from companies looking to advertise through them. ‚ÄúWe want to get real brand deals, you know, real endorsements now that we‚Äôre no longer a brand risk,‚Äù he says.\nMBox made these comments in September 2024. In January of this year, a judge in New Jersey sentenced Antonio Ginestri to five years in state prison in connection with a series of robberies, including driving off with an ATM filled with $4,000 from a Dunkin‚Äô Donuts. The sentence came after a contested plea deal, which a Bergen County prosecutor noted in court, was negotiated following a crime spree that allegedly included ‚Äúracing across the streets of NYC, though these charges haven't been proven.‚Äù Ginestri still faces an assault charge in New York. There are also open charges against him in two other New Jersey counties and an active warrant for him in Connecticut.\nGinestri‚Äôs attorney, Stefan Erwin, and MBox maintain it‚Äôs not Ginestri driving in those YouTube videos. It‚Äôs unclear when he might stand trial for any of the additional charges. During Ginestri‚Äôs New Jersey sentencing, Judge Christopher Kazlau said he didn‚Äôt believe Ginestri when he claimed he‚Äôd stay out of trouble if released. The only thing that stopped Ginestri was that he got caught, Kazlau said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not very good at covering your tracks.‚Äù\nAdditional reporting by Matt Giles.",

The duo was armed with nothing but a camera, Squeeze‚Äôs BMW, and the shared desire to ‚Äúgo viral.‚Äù</p><p class=\"paywall\">The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lxvb3GOdNc&amp;t=244s\">video</a> they ended up filming that night shows them running red lights, narrowly avoiding scrapes with other cars, doing doughnuts at intersections, and even driving backward up a one-way street, all at high speeds. After being posted to YouTube last year, the footage was viewed more than 11 million times. It seemed their brand was on the rise‚Äîat least until the New York Police Department got involved.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">On May 21, the department's deputy commissioner of operations, Kaz Daughtry, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://x.com/NYPDDaughtry/status/1793002356822393330\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://x.com/NYPDDaughtry/status/1793002356822393330\" href=\"https://x.com/NYPDDaughtry/status/1793002356822393330\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">proudly posted</a> on X that the NYPD had ‚ÄúSqueeze.benz‚Äù in custody. Authorities cited his reckless driving, including outracing police. But when the NYPD charged Antonio Ginestri, 19 at the time and linked to the social media account in a New York Post report, the offense was third-degree assault, which law enforcement said stemmed from an unrelated incident several months prior. \"One of the most prolific street racers in NYC can no longer treat the Big Apple like the Indy 500,\" Daughtry claimed.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">There‚Äôs just one problem: MBox swears that the NYPD implicated the wrong guy as Squeeze.</p><p class=\"paywall\">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even want to get too much into that, but that was somebody else. They don‚Äôt have the real Squeeze,‚Äù MBox, an up-and-coming rapper in his mid-twenties who claims to be Squeeze‚Äôs ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù and interpreter, alleges to me via a Discord voice call. (MBox, like other YouTubers WIRED interviewed for this story, declined to give any identifying details.) ‚ÄúThe real Squeeze is right next to me‚Äîhe hasn‚Äôt been publicly identified.‚Äù</p><p class=\"paywall\">It would be easy to write this all off as bravado from a bunch of high-speed clout chasers, except for one thing: In September, more than three months after Ginestri‚Äôs arrest, while he was still in custody, a new video appeared on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Squeeze.Benz./videos\">Squeeze.Benz</a> YouTube channel. It showed footage of several vehicles‚Äîone purportedly being driven by Squeeze‚Äîdrifting and doing doughnuts in the center of Columbus Circle and Times Square, surrounded by pedestrians they narrowly missed hitting with their convoy of cars.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It is one of a barrage of clips uploaded to the channel, which has more than 735,000 subscribers and features video after video of high-speed, palm-sweat-inducing jaunts around New York City. Together, MBox and Squeeze have amassed an enormous fan base of car enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies‚Äîand set the scene for YouTube‚Äôs riskiest new niche: ‚Äúswimmers‚Äù who weave through traffic at breakneck speeds.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The trend, partly driven by the lure of internet clout and social media fame, has become a focal point for the NYPD, who seem determined to stamp out the practice. Now, the drivers swear they have plans to go legit‚Äîbefore they get arrested, or worse.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "The basic machine for grinding a steel ball bearing has been the same since around 1900, but manufacturers have been steadily automating everything around it. Today, the process is driven by a conveyor belt, and, for the most part, it‚Äôs automatic. The most urgent task for humans is to figure out when things are going wrong‚Äîand even that could soon be handed over to AI.\nThe Schaeffler factory in Homburg starts with steel wire that is cut and pressed into rough balls. Those balls are hardened in a series of furnaces, and then put through three increasingly precise grinders until they are spherical to within a tenth of a micron. The result is one of the most versatile components in modern industry, enabling low-friction joints in everything from lathes to car engines.\nThat level of precision requires constant testing‚Äîbut when defects do turn up, tracking them down can present a puzzle. Testing might show a defect occurring at some point on the assembly line, but the cause may not be obvious. Perhaps the torque on a screwing tool is off, or a newly replaced grinding wheel is impacting quality. Tracking down the problem means comparing data across multiple pieces of industrial equipment, none of which were designed with this in mind.\nThis too may soon be a job for machines. Last year, Schaeffler became one of the first users of Microsoft‚Äôs Factory Operations Agent, a new product powered by large language models and designed specifically for manufacturers. The chatbot-style tool can help track down the causes of defects, downtime, or excess energy consumption. The result is something like ChatGPT for factories, with OpenAI‚Äôs models being used on the backend thanks to the company‚Äôs partnership with Microsoft‚Äôs Azure.\nKathleen Mitford, Microsoft‚Äôs corporate vice president for global industry marketing, describes the project as ‚Äúa reasoning agent that operates on top of manufacturing data.‚Äù As a result, Mitford says, ‚Äúthe agent is capable of understanding questions and translating them with precision and accuracy against standardized data models.‚Äù So a factory worker might ask a question like ‚ÄúWhat is causing a higher than usual level of defects?‚Äù and the model would be able to answer with data from across the manufacturing process.\nThe agent is deeply integrated into Microsoft‚Äôs existing enterprise products, particularly Microsoft Fabric, its data analytics system. This means that Schaeffler, which runs hundreds of plants on Microsoft‚Äôs system, is able to train its agent on data from all over the world.\nStefan Soutschek, Schaeffler‚Äôs vice president in charge of IT, says the scope of data analysis is the real power of the system. ‚ÄúThe major benefit is not the chatbot itself, although it helps,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the combination of this OT [operational technology] data platform in the backend, and the chatbot relying on that data.‚Äù\nDespite the name, this isn‚Äôt agentic AI: It doesn‚Äôt have goals, and its powers are limited to answering whatever questions the user asks. You can set up the agent to execute basic commands through Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot studio, but the goal isn‚Äôt to have the agent making its own decisions. This is primarily AI as a data access tool.\nThat‚Äôs particularly valuable in manufacturing, where tracking down a set of errors might mean comparing data across quality assurance systems, HR software, and industrial control systems like kilns and precision drills. Within the industry, this is known as the IT/OT gap: the disconnect between information tech like spreadsheets and the operational tech that‚Äôs used in a factory. AI companies believe large language models like the Factory Operations Agent will be able to work across that gap, allowing it to answer basic troubleshooting questions in a conversational way.\nThe Factory Operations Agent is due to leave public preview later this year, making it broadly available to Azure AI users. But there will be plenty of competing systems hoping to play a role on the factory floor. As tech companies look for ways to make money from recent breakthroughs in LLMs, manufacturing has proven to be a tempting target. Last September, Google rolled out an update to its Manufacturing Data Engine specifically aimed at unlocking data held on industrial devices, and both Microsoft and Google maintain platforms where independent developers can test out systems with different fine-tuning strategies and different tolerances for risk.\nThat competition is good for the field, but the increasing use of industrial AI also raises the stakes for safety‚Äîparticularly on the factory floor, where malfunctions can be a matter of life or death. Crucially, the Factory Operations Agent only manipulates data rather than directly controlling machinery, but there are still concerns. Speaking in his personal capacity, Duncan Eddy, executive director of the Stanford Center for AI Safety, says the biggest concern for AI models like the Factory Operations Agent is simply that users won‚Äôt recognize when the system is starting to fail, or won‚Äôt know how to intervene once they do.\n‚ÄúThese systems can fail in new and surprising and unpredictable ways,‚Äù he says.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nA new age of commercial moon exploration is upon us, and one of the most exciting missions yet is about to launch‚Äîone laden with rovers, a drill, and even a hopper spacecraft that will try to ‚Äújump‚Äù into a permanently dark lunar crater to search for ice.\nThe IM-2 mission, from Texas-based company Intuitive Machines, is scheduled to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida on Wednesday, February 26. The lander, nicknamed Athena and about the size of a car, is partially funded by NASA, as the US space agency attempts to create a new lunar economy that can support upcoming planned human missions to the moon.\n‚ÄúNASA and the space industry is creating a new business, getting science and payloads to the surface of the moon,‚Äù says Laura Forczyk, founder of the Florida-based space consultancy firm Astralytical. ‚ÄúAnd these uncrewed missions are preparing us to send humans.‚Äù\nIM-2 is funded by a NASA program called Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, which started in 2018 under the first Trump administration. The goal was to give money to private companies to build landers to travel to the moon, carrying NASA instruments and other equipment to the lunar surface, ahead of the planned return of humans this decade in the Artemis program. Up to $2.6 billion in funding has been earmarked through 2028, with Intuitive Machines receiving $47 million for this mission.\nThe CLPS program has had mixed results so far. Its first mission, the Peregrine lander built by the Pennsylvania-based firm Astrobotic, suffered a fuel leak and abandoned its landing attempt in January 2024. The next CLPS mission featured Intuitive Machines‚Äô first lander, IM-1, which landed on its side. ‚ÄúWe were able to get some data back, but we don‚Äôt want to end up on our side on this mission,‚Äù says Trent Martin, senior vice president of space systems at Intuitive Machines.\nIM-2 will join another CLPS mission at the moon that has already launched, the Blue Ghost lander from Firefly of Texas, which is scheduled to attempt a landing in early March. Blue Ghost is targeting a region in the moon‚Äôs northern hemisphere, the Sea of Tranquillity, near where the Apollo 11 mission landed in 1969. IM-2, which will attempt its landing later in March, is targeting the moon‚Äôs south pole, a region of arguably greater scientific interest.\nScientists think there might be ice trapped at the moon‚Äôs poles, particularly in permanently shadowed regions, or PSRs. These are craters near the poles that, because of the moon‚Äôs tilt towards the sun, never receive sunlight on their insides. Temperatures on the surface of the moon can fluctuate between -150 and 120 degrees Celsius (-250 and 250 degrees Fahrenheit) as it turns from night to daytime over the course of a lunar day (which is about the same length as a month on Earth). However, in PSRs temperatures never rise above -170 degrees Celsius.\n‚ÄúIce is a key volatile that we‚Äôre interested in,‚Äù says Adam Schlesinger, project manager of CLPS at NASA‚Äôs Johnson Space Center in Texas. ‚ÄúYou could use the ice to generate propellant on the surface,‚Äù which could be used to launch back from the lunar surface to Earth, or perhaps even one day to venture to other worlds such as Mars.\nThere are more than 10 instruments and vehicles aboard IM-2. Three of those will be deployed on the way to the moon, including a spacecraft called Odin from the Californian asteroid-mining company AstroForge, which will attempt to fly past and take pictures of a suspected metallic near-Earth asteroid later this year, which the company hopes to extract resources from in the future. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be the first time a commercial company has ever gone to deep space,‚Äù says Matt Gialich, AstroForge‚Äôs founder and CEO.\nIM-2 will then attempt to touch down using a combination of thrusters, a laser system to check its altitude and speed, and its landing legs. If all goes according to plan it will land in a region called Mons Mouten, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the moon‚Äôs south pole. China and India have also landed near the lunar south pole before, but neither as close as Intuitive Machines hopes to.\nOn board the lander is a NASA drill called Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment-1 (PRIME-1). The drill will attempt to burrow up to a meter into the ground and look for any ice and other materials mixed into the surface. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs designed to look for resources that could be extracted and used for future exploration,‚Äù says Schlesinger.\nAfter landing, IM-2 will deploy several vehicles on the surface. Two of these are rovers, one a cylindrical vehicle the size of a shampoo bottle built by the Japanese company Dymon, called Yaoki, that will take images of the surface around the lander. The other, a larger rover the size of a suitcase from the Colorado company Lunar Outpost, called MAPP (Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform), will drive off into the distance at a top speed of 10 centimeters a second.\nMAPP has a communications device from Nokia to test 4G/LTE technology on the moon, and it will also take pictures of the IM-2 lander and the surface, creating a 3D map of the surrounding location. ‚ÄúThis is a location that Artemis astronauts might go to in the future, so it‚Äôs a very useful map to have,‚Äù says Justin Cyrus, the company‚Äôs founder and CEO.\nA tiny ant-like robot designed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will also crawl over the top of the rover, taking ‚Äúreadings of how our rover is performing,‚Äù says Cyrus. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be pretty awesome.‚Äù\nThe other vehicle being deployed on the surface, by launching off the lander, is Intuitive Machines‚Äô own Micro Nova Hopper. Nicknamed Grace, this machine‚Äîthe size of a guitar‚Äîwill use three engines to ‚Äújump‚Äù across the surface. After a couple of practice hops, Grace will then try something unprecedented‚Äîentering a permanently shadowed moon crater.\nThe team is targeting a small crater about 200 meters from the landing site currently known simply as ‚ÄúH.‚Äù About 250 meters (820 feet) across, the size of a football stadium, and 20 meters (65 feet) deep, the floor of the crater never sees sunlight. That means it might be a prime location for water ice, something that has been hinted at in PSRs by data from orbiting spacecraft. Grace will jump into the crater for 45 minutes and then switch on its spotlight to illuminate the floor before jumping back out. While in the crater it will take images and readings, using a small infrared instrument designed by the German space agency and the Free University of Berlin to measure the temperature. ‚ÄúIf the crater is cold enough, there could be water ice on the bottom,‚Äù says Max Hamm, the instrument‚Äôs project manager at the Free University.\nGrace also has a neutron spectrometer built by the Hungarian company Pulis Space Technologies, which will look for neutrons coming from the surface that might have been affected by hydrogen in any ice in the ground. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre extremely excited,‚Äù says Tibor Pacher, the company‚Äôs founder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a first.‚Äù\nThese two instruments and Grace‚Äôs camera might tell us if there is ice in the crater. Although sheet ice sitting on the crater‚Äôs floor is ‚Äúunlikely,‚Äù says Martin, it‚Äôs possible that Grace might see hints of ice mixed into the lunar soil. Such a finding would be invaluable for the return of humans to the moon. NASA wants to land astronauts at the moon‚Äôs south pole starting with its Artemis III mission on SpaceX‚Äôs Starship vehicle in 2027. Future Artemis missions might involve descending into some of the moon‚Äôs craters of eternal darkness to collect some of the ice.\nEventually, astronauts might use this ice as a resource: as rocket fuel and drinking water. ‚ÄúIf we have people there, they will need water,‚Äù says Pacher. It would also be scientifically valuable, giving us an insight into the origin of water on the moon and by extension Earth, too. IM-2 is of particular importance given that NASA‚Äôs other planned venture into a lunar crater to look for ice, its VIPER rover, was canceled last year. Grace is ‚Äúthe only way right now that anyone is going into a crater,‚Äù says Martin.\nIM-2 also highlights the broad commercial partnerships that might be possible on upcoming lunar missions. Aside from Nokia and the other companies mentioned, there is another, more unusual partner on the lander too: a clothing company from Oregon in the US called Columbia Sportswear. The company has provided two fabric-like covers for the IM-2 mission based on its clothing brands, one on top of the lander to keep IM-2 cool in direct sunlight, and one on one of the lander‚Äôs helium tanks to keep the tank warm.\n‚ÄúWe realized the same exact material that we use in our jackets and winter wear is actually qualified for space travel,‚Äù says Haskell Beckham, vice president of innovation at Columbia Sportswear. ‚ÄúIntuitive Machines reached out to us, and a partnership was born.‚Äù\nThere is another left-field instrument on board too‚Äîa space-hardened data-storage device built by the Florida-based company Lonestar Data Holdings. With 8 terabytes of data on board from various companies, including a copy of the video game Starfield supplied by the game‚Äôs developer, Bethesda, the company will practice transferring data from the moon.

Although sheet ice sitting on the crater‚Äôs floor is ‚Äúunlikely,‚Äù says Martin, it‚Äôs possible that Grace might see hints of ice mixed into the lunar soil. Such a finding would be invaluable for the return of humans to the moon. NASA wants to land astronauts at the moon‚Äôs south pole starting with its Artemis III mission on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/spacex-starship-superheavy-mars-launch-elon-musk/\">SpaceX‚Äôs Starship vehicle</a> in 2027.

    "content_text": "Not only has China‚Äôs largest EV maker BYD unveiled good, better, and best tiers for its advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), it announced last week that the tech‚Äîmarketed somewhat immodestly as ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Eye‚Äù‚Äîwill now be fitted as standard to 21 of BYD‚Äôs 30 cars split across four brands.\nEven the $9,500 Seagull hatchback, the cheapest of BYD‚Äôs EVs, will ship with the base level of God‚Äôs Eye at no extra cost, while the $233,500 Yangwang U9 electric supercar will get the top-tier iteration. However, BYD‚Äôs ADAS system could be as misleadingly named as Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving (FSD).\nIncluding ADAS for free will no doubt rile BYD‚Äôs smaller rivals in China‚Äôs innovative but cutthroat auto market. Comparatively low-tech Toyota, VW, and Nissan may weaken further, and Tesla‚Äîwhich has yet to gain permission for FSD in China‚Äîcould also struggle.\nElon Musk‚Äôs auto firm temporarily lost the title of the world‚Äôs largest EV maker to BYD last year, and since then competition has been fierce. BYD topped the Chinese market for EVs in January with a 27 percent market share, pushing the previously dominant Tesla down to sixth place on just 4.5 percent.\nGod‚Äôs Eye (an alternative translation is ‚ÄúEye of Heaven‚Äù) relies on various cameras and sensors to assist drivers with valet parking, adaptive cruising, and automated braking. Among other tasks, it can also learn users‚Äô driving habits and supposedly predict the type and skill level of a new driver taking control.\nCareful not to describe God‚Äôs Eye as fully autonomous, BYD‚Äôs billionaire founder and CEO Wang Chuanfu boasted during a lavish launch event at the company‚Äôs headquarters in Shenzhen last week that intelligent driving capabilities would soon become as ubiquitous as seat belts and airbags.\nChuanfu then cut to a promotional video showing a U9 spinning a driverless donut at the Hunan Zhuzhou International Circuit before racing around corners at high speed with tires squealing, and at night.\nGod‚Äôs Eye is L2+ ADAS‚Äîsimilar to Tesla‚Äôs FSD‚Äîand would, therefore, still require supervision from a human driver on a public road. As defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the stages of automated driving are measured on a scale of 0 to 5, with Level 0 involving no driving automation through to Level 5, which is full automation.\nL2+, not an SAE-accepted term, is used by automakers to imply progression through the levels. The ‚Äúplus‚Äù part refers to hands-off-the-steering-wheel driving with eyes on the road ahead.\nPowerful computers in a car equipped with L2+ control can follow a mapped route, make lane changes, and moderate speed in traffic. L2+ keeps the burden of liability with the driver but gives at least the sensation of hands-free driving. Unlike in the US, China‚Äôs ADAS rules state that a driver‚Äôs hand must always be on the steering wheel.\nBYD's moniker may suggest its in-house L2+ ADAS is omniscient, but Shanghai-based automotive commentator Mark Rainford of Inside China Auto has test-driven several Chinese L2+ cars, and he is more impressed with Huawei's Qiankun system than God‚Äôs Eye. Incidentally, continuing the deification nomenclature, Huawei's own General Obstacle Detection network for autos is also referred to as ‚ÄúGOD.‚Äù\nRival automakers XPeng, Nio, and Li Auto, aided by their early adoption of Nvidia‚Äôs Orin X tech, a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that‚Äôs used to power autonomous driving and AI applications, are also more impressive than God‚Äôs Eye, states Rainford. The three are vying with BYD, Huawei, and others to offer the first true Level 3 autonomous driving system.\nBYD says it has obtained China‚Äôs first Level 3 assisted-driving testing license, but, in an internal communication, Xpeng‚Äôs chairman and CEO He Xiaopeng claimed in early February that his company could launch a commercial L3 product as early as the second half of this year.\nSimilarly, Li Auto‚Äôs L3 could also be ready for public release later this year. The firm‚Äôs MEGA OTA 7.0 intelligent driving system uses a Vision-Language Model, which supposedly allows the system to understand and interpret both visual and textual information simultaneously: It can spot bus lanes, for instance, a simple task for (most) human drivers, but seemingly tricky for some L2+ systems.\nBYD‚Äîthe pinyin initials of the company‚Äôs Chinese name, Biyadi, now back-formed into the Western-friendly slogan ‚ÄúBuild Your Dream‚Äù‚Äîentered the auto business in 2003, starting with batteries for internal-combustion-engine (ICE) vehicles before selling a plug-in hybrid car as early as 2008. The company ceased production and sales of ICE vehicles entirely in 2022.\nBYD cars made for sale outside of China‚Äîin Europe, for instance‚Äîlikely won‚Äôt be fitted with fully functioning God‚Äôs Eye. In the US, President Biden banned nearly all Chinese connected-car software and hardware from model year 2027, and it‚Äôs unlikely that President Trump‚Äôs administration will reverse that decision. BYD and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on this article.\nChina, the world‚Äôs biggest car market, has adopted semi-automated driving more readily than anywhere else, with most domestic automakers providing technology between SAE‚Äôs Level 2 and Level 3. BYD, which sold over 4 million cars in 2024, is betting on its scale, access to mapping and other data‚Äîand 5,000 ADAS-dedicated software engineers‚Äîto further its path to dominance. Its shares climbed 21 percent in Hong Kong on expectations that God‚Äôs Eye would be market-moving, while Xpeng‚Äôs shares closed 9 percent lower, and Geely dropped 10.3 percent.\nAt an unspecified later date, BYD said that God‚Äôs Eye would integrate the R1 large language model (LLM) from DeepSeek, the Chinese startup that recently stunned markets with its open-source generative AI. The integration is expected to control voice-activated features and infotainment systems mainly, but could also be used for some ADAS tasks. Zeekr, Geely, Vyah, and M-Hero have also recently announced integration with DeepSeek.\nIn addition to cloud and vehicle AI, every BYD car with the new God‚Äôs Eye system will sport Xuanji architecture, introduced in January last year, acting as the car‚Äôs brain and neural network. With a central processor and access to 5G and satellite networks, the system apparently perceives changes in the internal and external environment of the car in real time. It feeds it back to Xuanji‚Äôs ‚Äúbrain‚Äù for supposedly almost instant decisionmaking.\nStrictly speaking, God‚Äôs Eye is the camera, ultrasonic radar, and lidar array alone, split into A, B, and C variants, with A being best. The system‚Äôs operating software is known as DiPilot, introduced in 2020 on the BYD Han, and now with the good, better, and best tiers of DiPilot 100, 300, and 600.\nGod‚Äôs Eye A ships with DiPilot 600 and bristles with high-end cameras and radar, and front- and side-facing lidar sensors. This best system will be fitted to BYD‚Äôs luxury Yangwang EVs, including the U9 supercar. ‚ÄúThe video of the U9 [on the track] was theater,‚Äù believes Rainford, who hasn‚Äôt heard of any autonomous driving system that can ‚Äúmake a car‚Äôs tires squeal around corners.‚Äù\nRainford adds that BYD is playing catch-up: ‚Äú2024 was a breakout year for urban-level autonomous driving systems in China, with the front-runners of Li Auto, XPeng, Nio, and Huawei joined by rivals such as Zeekr, Wey, and even more affordable brands like Leapmotor.‚Äù\nGod‚Äôs Eye B has cameras, radar, and one lidar unit married to DiPilot 300, and will be fitted to Denza, Song, and BYD‚Äôs other high-end cars. Both A and B God‚Äôs Eye systems offer FSD-style L2+ ADAS driving.\nGod‚Äôs Eye C with DiPilot 100 has cameras and radar, but no lidar, which could be akin to worshipping a ‚ÄúGod with nearsightedness,‚Äù Peter Norton, associate professor of history in the Department of Engineering and Society at the University of Virginia, tells WIRED.\n‚ÄúLike Tesla‚Äôs FSD, drivers with God‚Äôs Eye C aren‚Äôt supposed to use it away from divided highways. But presumably some BYD drivers, like some Tesla drivers, will use it on ordinary roads anyway‚Äîwith sometimes potentially lethal consequences,‚Äù says Norton, author of a book on autonomous driving. He worries that BYD‚Äôs use of divine terminology could lead to a false sense of security. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no attempt to caution drivers about the system‚Äôs limitations,‚Äù he stresses.\nRainford, too, cautions that God‚Äôs Eye isn‚Äôt yet perfect. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs way overhyped,‚Äù he says, pointing to the glowing press coverage of last week‚Äôs launch. ‚ÄúI drove DiPilot 100 last year on the BYD Song L, and it was far from great, requiring lever-activated overtakes. Even on the freeway it was not even close to the [LDAS] market leaders in China.‚Äù\nEven though it‚Äôs not yet allowed in China, Tesla‚Äôs FSD is believed by some to be technically inferior because it relies solely on cameras and AI, rather than lidar and other sensors.\n‚ÄúTesla has been overselling the effectiveness of its technology for years,‚Äù Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, told NPR last month. ‚ÄúAnd a lot of people buy into that. They‚Äôre kind of wrapped up in this belief that this is an autonomous vehicle, because it‚Äôs tweeted about that way.‚Äù\nMusk has been promising the imminent arrival of fully autonomous cars since at least 2016. At a Tesla shareholder meeting last year, Musk claimed the number of miles that FSD can drive without human intervention has increased. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs headed towards unsupervised full self-driving very quickly, at an exponential pace,‚Äù Musk claimed.\nIn 2022, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration published the results of a three-year investigation into Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot system, FSD‚Äôs forerunner, finding a ‚Äúcritical safety gap‚Äù between motorists‚Äô expectations of the driver-assistance system and its true capabilities.\nInvestigators at the time identified at least 13 fatal crashes in which ‚Äúforeseeable driver misuse of the Tesla system played an apparent role.‚Äù Tesla said in December 2023 that Autopilot‚Äôs software system controls ‚Äúmay not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse‚Äù and could increase the risk of a crash.\nWhile FSD is indeed a step up from Autopilot, there are seemingly still problems with the system, as evidenced by messages aimed at Musk on X from Tesla drivers. On February 9, drone software developer Jonathan Challinger reached out to Tesla and Musk after driving his Cybertruck into a pole on a four-lane highway in Reno, Nevada, at up to 45 mph while using FSD at night. Challinger‚Äôs Cybertruck was totaled, yet he thanked Tesla for ‚Äúengineering the best passive safety in the world,‚Äù stating that he ‚Äúwalked away without a scratch.‚Äù\nThe Cybertruck ‚Äúfailed to merge out of a lane that was ending and made no attempt to slow down or turn until it had already hit the curb,‚Äù wrote Challinger on a since-deleted post, blaming not the tech, but himself: ‚ÄúBig fail on my part, obviously. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did. Pay attention.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe commenters blame a crossing that any teenager with a learner‚Äôs permit and 1990 Ford Escort would navigate with ease,‚Äù says Norton. ‚ÄúAnd [Challinger] extols the over-engineered vehicle systems that coaxed him into discarding his most basic responsibilities as a driver. The combination of wasted wealth, human indifference, misapplied tech, and cognitive incompetence is depressing.‚Äù\nSadly, Norton doesn‚Äôt believe BYD‚Äôs God‚Äôs Eye will fare any better. ‚ÄúEven in the best equipped [L2+] car, the driver is likely to pay less attention and go faster. By the time a pedestrian saw the speeding high-tech car, there‚Äôd be no time left to read the plate before Eternity‚Äôs summons.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nCalculus is a powerful mathematical tool. But for hundreds of years after its invention in the 17th century, it stood on a shaky foundation. Its core concepts were rooted in intuition and informal arguments, rather than precise, formal definitions.\nTwo schools of thought emerged in response, according to Michael Barany, a historian of math and science at the University of Edinburgh. French mathematicians were by and large content to keep going. They were more concerned with applying calculus to problems in physics‚Äîusing it to compute the trajectories of planets, for instance, or to study the behavior of electric currents. But by the 19th century, German mathematicians had begun to tear things down. They set out to find counterexamples that would undermine long-held assumptions, and eventually used those counterexamples to put calculus on more stable and durable footing.\nOne of these mathematicians was Karl Weierstrass. Though he showed an early aptitude for math, his father pressured him to study public finance and administration, with an eye toward joining the Prussian civil service. Bored with his university coursework, Weierstrass is said to have spent most of his time drinking and fencing; in the late 1830s, after failing to get his degree, he became a secondary school teacher, giving lessons in everything from math and physics to penmanship and gymnastics.\nWeierstrass didn‚Äôt begin his career as a professional mathematician until he was nearly 40. But he would go on to transform the field by introducing a mathematical monster.\nThe Pillars of Calculus\nIn 1872, Weierstrass published a function that threatened everything mathematicians thought they understood about calculus. He was met with indifference, anger, and fear, particularly from the mathematical giants of the French school of thought. Henri Poincar√© condemned Weierstrass‚Äô function as ‚Äúan outrage against common sense.‚Äù Charles Hermite called it a ‚Äúdeplorable evil.‚Äù\nTo understand why Weierstrass‚Äô result was so unnerving, it helps to first understand two of the most fundamental concepts in calculus: continuity and differentiability.\nA continuous function is exactly what it sounds like‚Äîa function that has no gaps or jumps. You can trace a path from any point on such a function to any other without lifting your pencil.\nCalculus is in large part about determining how quickly such continuous functions change. It works, loosely speaking, by approximating a given function with straight, nonvertical lines.\nAt any given point on this curve, you can draw a ‚Äútangent‚Äù line‚Äîa line that best approximates the curve near that point. The slope, or steepness, of the tangent line measures how quickly the function is changing at that point. You can define another function, called the derivative, that provides the slope of the tangent line at each point on your original function. If the derivative exists at every point, then the original function is said to be differentiable.\nFunctions that contain discontinuities are never differentiable: You won‚Äôt be able to draw a tangent line that approximates the gaps, meaning your derivative won‚Äôt exist there. But even continuous functions aren‚Äôt always differentiable at every point. Consider the ‚Äúabsolute value‚Äù function, which looks like this:\nOn the left side of this V-shaped curve, tangent lines slope downward. On the right side, they slope upward. At the bottom vertex, the slope abruptly changes directions. The function‚Äôs derivative does not exist at that point, even though it‚Äôs well defined everywhere else.\nThis didn‚Äôt faze most 19th-century mathematicians. They saw it as an isolated phenomenon: So long as your function is continuous, they claimed, there can only be finitely many points where the derivative is not defined. At all other points, the function should still be nice and smooth. In other words, a function can only zig and zag so much.\nIn fact, in 1806, a prominent French mathematician and physicist named Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re claimed that he‚Äôd proved this. For decades, his reasoning went unchallenged. Then along came Weierstrass.\nWeierstrass‚Äô Monster\nWeierstrass discovered a function that, according to Amp√®re‚Äôs proof, should have been impossible: It was continuous everywhere yet differentiable nowhere.\nHe built it by adding together infinitely many wavelike ‚Äúcosine‚Äù functions. The more terms he added, the more his function zigzagged‚Äîuntil ultimately, it changed direction abruptly at every point, resembling an infinitely jagged sawtooth comb.\nMany mathematicians dismissed the function. It was an anomaly, they said‚Äîthe work of a pedant, mathematically useless. They couldn‚Äôt even visualize it. At first, when you try to plot the graph of Weierstrass‚Äô function, it looks smooth in certain regions. Only by zooming in will you see that those regions are jagged, too, and that they‚Äôll continue to get more serrated and badly behaved (what mathematicians call ‚Äúpathological‚Äù) with each additional magnification.\nBut Weierstrass had proved beyond doubt that, though his function had no discontinuities, it was never differentiable. To show this, he first revisited the definitions of ‚Äúcontinuity‚Äù and ‚Äúdifferentiability‚Äù that had been formulated decades earlier by the mathematicians Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Bernard Bolzano. These definitions relied on vague, plain-language descriptions and inconsistent notation, making them easy to misinterpret.\nSo Weierstrass rewrote them, using precise language and concrete mathematical formulas. (Every calculus student learns the epsilon-delta definition of a limit; it was Weierstrass who introduced the modern version of it and used it as the foundation for his definitions of continuity and differentiability.)\nHe was then able to show that his function satisfied his more rigorous definition of continuity. At the same time, he could also prove that at every point, his new formal definition of the function‚Äôs derivative never had a finite value; it always ‚Äúblew up‚Äù to infinity. In other words, continuity did not imply differentiability. His function was just as monstrous as mathematicians had feared.\nThe proof demonstrated that calculus could no longer rely on geometric intuition, as its inventors had done. It ushered in a new standard for the subject, one that was rooted in the careful analysis of equations. Mathematicians were forced to follow in Weierstrass‚Äô footsteps, further sharpening their definition of functions, their understanding of the relationship between continuity and differentiability, and their methods for computing derivatives and integrals. This work to standardize calculus has since grown into the field known as analysis; Weierstrass is considered one of its founders.\nBut his function‚Äôs legacy extends far beyond the foundations of calculus and analysis. It revealed that mathematics is full of monsters: impossible-seeming functions, strange objects (it‚Äôs one of the earliest examples of a fractal), wild behaviors. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a whole universe of possibilities, and the Weierstrass function is supposed to be opening your eyes to it,‚Äù said Philip Gressman of the University of Pennsylvania.\nIt also turned out to have many practical applications. In the early 20th century, physicists wanted to study Brownian motion, the random movement of particles in a liquid or gas. Because this movement is continuous but not smooth‚Äîcharacterized by rapid and infinitely tiny fluctuations‚Äîfunctions like Weierstrass‚Äô were perfect for modeling it. Similarly, such functions have been used to model uncertainty in how people make decisions and take risks, as well as the complicated behavior of financial markets.\nMuch like Weierstrass himself, the consequences of his function have sometimes been late to bloom. But they‚Äôre continuing to shape mathematics and its applications today.\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

But for hundreds of years after its invention in the 17th century, it stood on a shaky foundation. Its core concepts were rooted in intuition and informal arguments, rather than precise, formal definitions.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">Two schools of thought emerged in response, according to <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/michael-barany\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/michael-barany\" href=\"https://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/michael-barany\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Barany</a>, a historian of math and science at the University of Edinburgh. French mathematicians were by and large content to keep going. They were more concerned with applying calculus to problems in physics‚Äîusing it to compute the trajectories of planets, for instance, or to study the behavior of electric currents. But by the 19th century, German mathematicians had begun to tear things down. They set out to find counterexamples that would undermine long-held assumptions, and eventually used those counterexamples to put calculus on more stable and durable footing.</p><p class=\"paywall\">One of these mathematicians was Karl Weierstrass. Though he showed an early aptitude for math, his father pressured him to study public finance and administration, with an eye toward joining the Prussian civil service. Bored with his university coursework, Weierstrass is said to have spent most of his time drinking and fencing; in the late 1830s, after failing to get his degree, he became a secondary school teacher, giving lessons in everything from math and physics to penmanship and gymnastics.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Weierstrass didn‚Äôt begin his career as a professional mathematician until he was nearly 40. But he would go on to transform the field by introducing a mathematical monster.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">The Pillars of Calculus</h2><p class=\"paywall\">In 1872, Weierstrass published a function that threatened everything mathematicians thought they understood about calculus. He was met with indifference, anger, and fear, particularly from the mathematical giants of the French school of thought. Henri Poincar√© condemned Weierstrass‚Äô function as ‚Äúan outrage against common sense.‚Äù Charles Hermite called it a ‚Äúdeplorable evil.‚Äù</p><p class=\"paywall\">To understand why Weierstrass‚Äô result was so unnerving, it helps to first understand two of the most fundamental concepts in calculus: continuity and differentiability.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A continuous function is exactly what it sounds like‚Äîa function that has no gaps or jumps. You can trace a path from any point on such a function to any other without lifting your pencil.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Calculus is in large part about determining how quickly such continuous functions change. It works, loosely speaking, by approximating a given function with straight, nonvertical lines.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Illustration: Mark Belan/Quanta Magazine</span></p></figure></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "The top floor of the lodge at the Black Mountain ski resort in Jackson, New Hampshire, isn‚Äôt filled with red-cheeked skiers having lodge lunch, warming their boots by the fire, or taking a break from a day on the hill.\nInstead, the space is a sort of mountain IT department. Engineers, developers, and designers are camped out at desks, hard at work on the hardware and software upholding the ski resort‚Äôs point-of-sale system. The team makes up a living laboratory for a small tech consultancy called Entabeni Systems that, in the last few years, has quite nimbly carved out an entrepreneurial niche in the US ski industry.\nCompany founder Erik Mogensen is an engineer ski bum who told me he ‚Äúgrew up in a blue-collar family that spent all of its disposable income on skiing.‚Äù In fact, when Mogensen was 16 and the local hill in his upstate New York town shut down, he spent the better part of a season building his own ski run in his parents‚Äô backyard.\nNow, Mogensen is at it again, this time with higher stakes. The US ski resort industry and the independent operators that account for much of it are facing the sad reality of increasingly snowless winters and the increasingly insane economics of the sport. The US industry has become ever-more consolidated through a bottom-line-focused Wall Street approach at Vail and Alterra. These companies own snow sports‚Äô biggest multi-resort season passes‚ÄîEpic and Ikon, respectively‚Äîand have bought up many once-independently-owned ski resorts across the country. This has led to them dominating the industry, since their deep pockets can support snowmaking and mountain operations on a scale the resorts‚Äô original owners never could.\nOverall, the tectonic plates of the industry are shifting as resorts big and small struggle to find the next right step. Late last month, Vail‚Äôs investors pushed for an overhaul of the resort‚Äôs executive lineup, grumbling about unacceptable performance, while a group of ski-devoted in Oregon are vying to buy their beloved local resort, Mt. Bachelor.\nEntabeni, on the other hand, has quietly become the on-call expert shop for mom-and-pop US ski resorts that are still standing and working hard to uphold a relationship with their communities. The consultancy, which was founded in 2015, helps the mountains it works with streamline their tech‚Äîand in some cases introduce tech to begin with‚Äîwhile improving their operations to become more efficient and skier-friendly.\nThe company helps its ski-resort clients collect and analyze any and all data around how their business operates. Then, the Entabeni team will design and build hardware and software to solve the problems brought to light by that data collection, ultimately helping the resorts run more effectively and efficiently. A typical resort could employ Entabeni to analyze and collect data on skier behavior to find out where and how they spend their time on the runs and in the lodges. The company can trace the behavior of season pass holders to learn how often they show up, or break down lodge concessions sales and get behind a register during the lunch rush to see how things run.\nStill, Mogensen bristles at the suggestion that Entabeni is a tech company. He prefers to say it is really just a ski company, as it‚Äôs in the business of promoting skiing and making it more easier to run a successful and profitable resort, while making the sport more accessible and more enjoyable for everyone. That‚Äôs why so much of what Entabeni does goes beyond the actual tech bit of design, engineering, and building both software and hardware. On the slopes, they‚Äôll move some snow around with a cat, or stand in for a liftie if that‚Äôs what it takes to get a better sense of what customers experience in a day on the mountain. They‚Äôll even staff the resort‚Äôs customer service line to field calls from local skiers and tourists.\nSome who closely follow the ski industry have said Mogensen is out to save the sport. It might sound a bit overblown, but to Mogenson that just means he‚Äôs ‚Äúmaking sure more people can ski more often.‚Äù Entabeni‚Äôs work may be rooted in tech and data collection, says Mogensen, but the endgame is mostly about making the sport ‚Äúmore accessible, more welcoming, and more human.‚Äù\nUps and Downs\nSkiing in the US has become a luxury good. Mogensen points out that it‚Äôs nearly impossible to live in a mountain town these days unless you‚Äôre wealthy. Unless you‚Äôre living on a six- or seven-figure income, skiing more than once or twice a year can feel out of reach: Day passes to ski a random Saturday at Mount Snow in Vermont start at $169; at Deer Valley in Utah, a Saturday lift ticket starts at $329. (Skiing is much more affordable in other parts of the world, like Europe, where day passes average around $70.) Mogensen believes these high prices in the US do the industry no favors and ultimately miss the point of the sport to begin with. He sees skiing as a way to ‚Äúconnect more deeply with the natural world and others.‚Äù That connection, he says, is the essence of the sport and what makes it so special.\nHistorically, lift-served skiing in the US wasn‚Äôt really a thing until after WWII, says Stu Winchester, who founded, writes, and produces an industry newsletter and podcast called Storm Skiing Journal. That boom, he says, lasted until the mid-‚Äô70s when the industry‚Äôs first ‚Äúextinction event‚Äù occurred. Between the ‚Äô70s and ‚Äô90s, says Winchester, the number of lift-run ski areas in the US went from 800 to 500.\n‚ÄúThey failed because they did not install snowmaking,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe areas that installed snowmaking survived and found their niche. Now, we‚Äôre on the cusp of a second great ski area extinction event. This one will be determined by technology.‚Äù\nWhen Mogensen entered the industry with Entabeni, he had a sense things were tough, but he now admits he didn‚Äôt realize just how tough. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs insane; these [resorts] are extremely fragile and there‚Äôs a lot of catching up to do,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe math is super difficult.‚Äù\nAt its most basic function, a ski resort carries people up the hill so they can ski down. At most independent resorts, that people carrier was built in 1965. Servicing, maintaining, and running that piece of equipment is a total money-bleed, especially for small resorts that can‚Äôt negotiate margins in the same way the big players like Vail or Alterra can. This is exactly where Entabeni can step in by collecting data about skier and rider behavior, mountain operations, sales, and snowmaking. By knowing which runs are getting the most skiers or which runs skiers like to hit first, a resort can target its snowmaking accordingly. After learning that hamburgers and hot dogs aren‚Äôt selling in the lodge between 10:45 and 11:45 am, the kitchen can cut back on waste and save money on labor.\nEntabeni is also internally piloting an app at Black Mountain that will replace RFID cards next season, allowing skiers to directly access lifts just by tapping their phones. An RFID card catches only a swipe at the lift, while Entabeni can, through the app and the rest of the hardware and software it installs for clients, leverage a resort-wide system tailored specifically to skiing and how ski resorts operate, including the both online and onsite sales.\n‚ÄúNo other company has that level of control or influence,‚Äù Mogensen says. ‚ÄúWe don't need to integrate; we built the entire ecosystem.‚Äù\nParking Lot Handshakes\nEntabeni typically operates on the road, with a small fleet of tech-outfitted trucks. Mogensen and his team will back one of those trucks right into a resort‚Äôs parking lot and get to work. Rolling right up to the client‚Äôs doorstep gives the team the visibility it needs into the resort‚Äôs ticketing, operations, and snowmaking.\nIn 2023, Mogensen bought Indy Pass, the season pass that works across a collective of resorts‚Äîmany of them already Entabeni clients‚Äîthat competes to some degree with the Ikon and Epic passes sold by the big multi-resort players. It was a first step in building out what Mogensen sees as a three-pronged effort to meaningfully shift skiing and the businesses supporting it to a more streamlined and tech-friendly enterprise.\nThe third piece of that strategy came in the fall of last year: Mogensen bought Black Mountain, the oldest ski area in New Hampshire. He shipped a handful of his team members from their base in Granby, Colorado, to New England. There, they have been focused on improving the point-of-sale software and hardware at the ticket counter and in the lodge.\nMogensen aims to eventually offload the new and improved mountain as a co-op where its skier members can become co-owners, a business model that's growing popular in Europe. In the meantime, Mogensen is using Black Mountain as a laboratory for the Entabeni approach‚Äìwhere, by the way, all the new hardware, from the point-of-sale systems used for ticketing and concessions to the intake system used by the mountain‚Äôs ski school, is built in-house.\nThe advantage to custom-built hardware allows Entabeni (and now Black Mountain) to iterate on the fly, with a purpose-built approach aimed only at the ski industry and without the extra step of integration. Competing companies, like Skidata, offer similar solutions for a broader customer base including stadiums, amusement parks, and ski resorts. Morgensen‚Äôs hope is that the deep dive he‚Äôs doing at Black Mountain will result in learnings he and his team can apply to the rest of their ski resort customers.\nGeoff Hatheway, president of Magic Mountain ski area in Londonderry, Vermont, first met Mogensen through Indy Pass‚Äô former owner, Doug Fish. Mogensen had pulled a conference together for the independent operators on the Indy Pass at Powder Mountain (now owned by Netflix OG Reed Hastings, who has made headlines with his plans to offer private memberships at the resort). Hatheway says he was immediately taken by Mogensen‚Äôs mindset and Entabeni‚Äôs ability to tailor its solutions to meet each resort‚Äôs specific needs and address its unique pain points.\n‚ÄúWe are spending huge sums of money to put a product out on the hill,‚Äù says Hatheway, referencing the actual skiing and riding experience from snowmaking to ski school and lift operation. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a ton of money to put a product inside the business‚Äîsoftware and hardware‚Äîwhich requires a lot of upfront cost.‚Äù Entabeni absorbs that upfront cost for its resort partners and then takes a piece of the action (a single-digit percentage, and less for nonprofit resorts) on the backside. ‚ÄúThey are in it with us. If we do better, they do better.‚Äù\nPlus, says Hatheway, Mogenson‚Äôs overall ethos resonates, in that he‚Äôs all about the small independent operator and puts skin in the game as one, too. ‚ÄúHaving those guys show up in our parking lot, drink some beers after work, have a little cookout to get to know all the players at Entabeni is part of the personal approach that makes skiing a unique business,‚Äù he says. Magic Mountain has weekly calls with the Entabeni team to talk strategy and possible software and hardware upgrades. ‚ÄúErik takes that personal approach. The vans are one side of it: that he basically comes and lives with you for a week or two.‚Äù\nWho Wants to Scale, Anyway?\nJanlu Pretorius has worked at Entabeni as an engineer for three years. He is a member of the team that recently moved temporarily to New Hampshire to work at Black Mountain.\n‚ÄúThe hands-on approach is fundamentally different from what a lot of engineers experience,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat short feedback loop is remarkable from an engineering perspective. You can iterate a lot faster and be a lot more dynamic in your iterations. It sparks creativity. When I‚Äôm at the mountain now, and looking at the slopes, I can imagine all of the things we can apply and integrate into Entabeni as a whole.‚Äù\nMark Schroetel, Entabeni‚Äôs COO, agrees, but notes that the company‚Äôs ethos isn‚Äôt just about solving problems but anticipating them. For instance, Schroetel says, three seasons ago the company spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless hours on building a point-of-sale system for its clients. While no Entabeni clients were complaining about the product, Mogensen and his team weren‚Äôt really satisfied with the way the credit card terminal was working. They were convinced they could do better. So, totally unprompted, they scrapped it and did it all over again‚Äîspending tens of thousands of dollars and burning hundreds of hours more‚Äîto build and reinstall a new version. ‚ÄúA small resort can‚Äôt afford $300,000 for a new point-of-sale system,‚Äù says Schroetel.\nWhen resorts do need to make upgrades on the mountain, they‚Äôre dealing with things like chairlifts and snowmaking systems, which can cost more than the resort itself. Resort owners are shouldering impossible economics in every aspect of their businesses. And that‚Äôs where Entabeni has an advantage; its reach far outstretches anything its clients could pull off on their own.\nStill, Mogensen seems acutely aware that in the ski industry, it is incredibly difficult to win the day. Data can be shoddy, and the economics of keeping an independent resort snow-covered and running steadily while leveling up its tech enough to fully understand its customers is impossibly tough. The math is hard and the competition is very real, Mogensen says. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine trying to open a homegrown hardware store with a Lowes and a Home Depot down the street.‚Äù\nHis hope, he says, is that with Entabeni, Indy Pass, and the model he‚Äôs cultivating at Black Mountain, another path opens: one that offers resorts a sustainable and nimble way of doing business that also keeps skiing accessible to anyone who‚Äôs up for it, not just the folks drinking champagne in first class seats.\n‚ÄúThese little guys can change things a lot quicker,‚Äù Mogensen says. ‚ÄúThey can make shorter innovations and pick up market share. It isn‚Äôt just about the money. We‚Äôre fighting for people‚Äôs time. We are trying to keep these places open. They provide an experience that‚Äôs different than what skiing has become.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "On Saturday, employees throughout the federal government received an email from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), demanding a reply with ‚Äúapprox. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week.‚Äù On X, Elon Musk posted that failure to respond ‚Äúwill be taken as a resignation.‚Äù The result? Confusion, chaos, and resentment among a federal workforce that increasingly feels under attack.\n‚ÄúSo fucking dumb,‚Äù says one air traffic controller who received the email and was granted anonymity for fear of retribution. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union that represents ATC personnel, told its members not to respond until Federal Aviation Administration leadership provided guidance.\nLeaders of many agencies appear to have been caught off guard. At the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Weather Service, some managers initially cautioned against replying to the email in case it was a phishing attempt. Another NOAA employee says they were cautioned not to log on to their work email after receiving it.\nOther workers were met with conflicting guidance from their managers. At the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is anticipating deep cuts orchestrated by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), some employees reported being told to await further guidance while others say their managers instructed people to comply.\nThe email appears to have been sent even to federal judges. ‚ÄúWe understand that some judges and judiciary staff have received an email from HR@opm.gov,‚Äù read an email from the director‚Äôs office of the Department of Administrative Services for US Federal Courts. ‚ÄúPlease be advised that this email did not originate from the Judiciary or the Administrative Office and we suggest that no action be taken.‚Äù\nAt least some military personnel also received the email and have been told to await guidance from the Department of Defense. That holding pattern appears to be the response at most agencies, where workers say they have not heard from senior leadership if and how they should handle this latest escalation in Musk and DOGE‚Äôs ongoing efforts to dramatically reduce the federal workforce. At the National Institutes of Health, for instance, in an email with the subject line ‚ÄúPlease Await Guidance,‚Äù some workers were told that ‚Äúinformation is forthcoming,‚Äù without any indication of when or from whom.\nAnother consideration for many is not only whether they should reply but how. While the OPM email specified that employees should not send classified information, links, or attachments, that severely limits how workers at many government agencies might be able to respond.\n‚ÄúNational security staff are getting notified of OPM‚Äôs request, which is taking them from the important work of ensuring national security interests,‚Äù said one source, who was granted anonymity due to the nature of their work. ‚ÄúThese are essential employees who keep us safe.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe Executive Committee is currently reviewing this request to determine appropriate guidelines regarding what information can be shared outside of the agency,‚Äù reads an email from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which sits within the Treasury Department. ‚ÄúPlease wait for additional guidance.‚Äù\nNBC News reported Saturday that even Kash Patel, the newly installed Federal Bureau of Investigation director and close ally of President Donald Trump, has instructed employees not to respond to the OPM email. The State Department also told workers not to engage. ‚ÄúThe State Department will respond on behalf of the Department,‚Äù reads an email from leadership, viewed by WIRED and first reported by journalist Marisa Kabas of the Handbasket. ‚ÄúNo employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command.‚Äù\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at barrett.64.\nThis is not the first time that OPM, which operates as effectively the government‚Äôs human resources department and is currently run by associates of Musk, has thrown the government into a state of alarm. In late January, OPM sent an email with the subject line ‚ÄúFork in the Road,‚Äù offering deferred resignation to anyone opposed to the new administration‚Äôs return-to-office policy or stated desire for employees who are ‚Äúreliable‚Äù and ‚Äúloyal.‚Äù\nThat email was strikingly similar to one that Musk sent early in his Twitter takeover. Ultimately, according to White House figures, 75,000 emails took the deferred resignation offer; given annual turnover rates in the massive federal workforce, it‚Äôs likely that many if not most of those who took the offer were retiring or otherwise set to leave anyway. This latest email also closely resembles one that Musk sent to Twitter staff in June 2023.\nWhile Musk has publicly presented himself as responsible for the email‚Äîand is the only source of the forced resignation threat‚Äîit‚Äôs unclear under what authority he would be able to fire federal employees at will over an email response. The White House has asserted in court documents that Musk is a ‚Äúsenior advisor‚Äù rather than the administrator of DOGE or otherwise in a position of real power. ‚ÄúLike other senior White House advisors, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,‚Äù the director of the White House Office of Administration wrote in a sworn statement.\nAdditional reporting by Andrew Couts, Paresh Dave, Vittoria Elliott, Tim Marchman, Aarian Marshall, and Zo√´ Schiffer.\nUpdate 2/23/25 10:30 pm ET: This story has been updated with additional details from the FAA and State Department.",

At the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-national-institute-of-standards-and-technology-braces-for-mass-firings/\">anticipating deep cuts</a> orchestrated by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), some employees reported being told to await further guidance while others say their managers instructed people to comply.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The email appears to have been sent even to federal judges. ‚ÄúWe understand that some judges and judiciary staff have received an email from <a href=\"mailto:HR@opm.gov\">HR@opm.gov</a>,‚Äù read an email from the director‚Äôs office of the Department of Administrative Services for US Federal Courts. ‚ÄúPlease be advised that this email did not originate from the Judiciary or the Administrative Office and we suggest that no action be taken.‚Äù</p><p class=\"paywall\">At least some military personnel also received the email and have been told to await guidance from the Department of Defense.

At the National Institutes of Health, for instance, in an email with the subject line ‚ÄúPlease Await Guidance,‚Äù some workers were told that ‚Äúinformation is forthcoming,‚Äù without any indication of when or from whom.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Another consideration for many is not only whether they should reply but how.

    "content_text": "The Best Meta Quest Games You Can Play Right Now\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nWith the release of the Meta Quest 3S (8/10, WIRED Review), Meta is hoping for a surge in interest in its mixed reality tech. The new headset brings key features like color passthrough and hand tracking to the lower $300 price point, rendering the older Quest 2 largely inadvisable.\nMeanwhile, Meta discontinued production of the Quest Pro in January of 2025, making the Quest 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) the de facto upgrade pick, with a higher resolution screen and the improved pancake lenses. Both options are among our favorite VR headsets, thanks to their range of affordable prices and their ability to play games and activities completely on their own, without the help of a console or computer.\nNo matter which headset you have, there are hundreds of games available‚Äîeverything from shooters to puzzlers to mini golf. The AR features on the Quest 3 and Quest 3S enable whole new genres that can use your real environment as part of the game or application. We've spent countless hours trying dozens of games and apps on the Meta Store. Here are some of our favorites.\nOnce you‚Äôre ready to start casting Superhot for your roommates‚Äô enjoyment, check out our buying guides to the Best TVs and the Best USB Hubs and Docks.\nUpdated February 2025: We added Walkabout Mini Golf, Batman: Arkham Shadow, and Myst, and we updated the tips section.\nSpecial offer for Gear readers: Get a 1-year subscription to WIRED for $5 ($25 off). This includes unlimited access to WIRED.com and our print magazine (if you'd like). Subscriptions help fund the work we do every day.\nTips Before Playing\nBefore you can actually play, there are a few things you need to do. Here are some tips for getting everything set up, because the Quest interface is not always the easiest to navigate.\nSet your boundary. The last thing you want while playing is to run into an object in your room while essentially blindfolded. Your Quest will guide you through the process of setting up your boundary. Roomscale lets you draw a play space to move freely, Stationary when you're standing still. But what if you move locations? Or want to play a game sitting down instead of standing up?\nTo change your boundary, press the Oculus button on your right controller (it's the one just underneath the joystick). This pulls up the menu at the bottom of the screen (you only have to do this if the menu isn't already showing up). From there, if you hover over the clock, you can choose the Quick Settings panel. Then choose Guardian. If you pick Stationary, you just have to hit confirm and you're all set. If you pick Roomscale, it'll guide you through drawing a new Guardian boundary.\nYour Quest may also support room mapping, which uses the exterior cameras to find walls and objects in your space and remember them for later. This makes moving between rooms smooth and effortless, as well as enabling advanced XR features in some games. You can find the information on this feature in the ‚ÄúEnvironment Setup\" tab of your settings.\nBuy the games. The Meta Quest Store is the easiest way to buy games for your headset, but there are three ways to do it. Regardless of which option you pick, you need to have a payment method on file (credit card, debit card, or PayPal). The browser method is the easiest way to enter these details.\n- Browser: Log in to the store. From there, you can either type the name of the game into the search bar on the top right or click ‚ÄúApps & Games‚Äù to browse. Once you've chosen a game, there is a blue button on the right of its info page that lists its price. Hit that and it'll prompt you to purchase.\n- App: Download the Oculus app and log in to your account. Click on the Store button on the bottom left and, as with the browser steps, you can either scroll through or search for a specific title. Once you've clicked on a game, the app uses the same button with a price system at the bottom of the screen. Just click on the button, review the payment details, and hit purchase.\n- Headset: With the headset on, bring up the bottom menu again. The Store icon is the orange one with a little shopping bag. Click on this, and you have the option of browsing through games or search. Once you've picked a game and are looking at its info page, hit the blue button on the right with the price marker to purchase.\nNote: If the game is free, the blue button will say ‚ÄúGet‚Äù rather than listing a price. And if you purchase the game via a browser or the app, you will still need to download it on your headset. See the next step for instructions.\nDownload and access your games. Once you've purchased a game, you need to download it. If you purchased it through the Store on your headset, the download should automatically start. Once it's done, the button will change to ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù so you can jump right in.\nIf you purchased the game via the browser or app, head to the Store on your headset and search for the game. The store will list it as ‚ÄúPurchased,‚Äù but when you click on its info page the blue button will have changed from listing the price to saying ‚ÄúDownload.‚Äù Hit that and it will automatically show you the download's progress bar.\nIf your headset is plugged in, or on a charging dock, and in standby mode, you can also use the Oculus App to initiate a download on the device. I'll use this to pick up a game on my phone, and then have it ready to go when I put the headset on.\nTo access all of your games‚Äîboth purchased and downloaded‚Äîbring up the bottom menu bar by hitting the Oculus button on that right controller. From there, click on the ‚ÄúApps‚Äù button on the right (the one with the nine dots). This will show you all of your purchases, and you can filter to see just the ones that are installed or the ones that aren't. Click on the game's icon and it should load right up.\nRecenter your screen. Occasionally, you'll find that your screen is no longer centered the way you want it. Maybe you took off your headset to check your phone or drink some water, or maybe you're in-game and want to change your orientation. To quickly reset your view, hold the Meta button on the right controller for a few seconds. You'll see a small dial appear, and once it fills in, the view will reset to the direction you're currently looking.\nCheck your battery life. When fully charged, the Quest's battery normally lasts around two hours. If you're not sure how much juice your headset has left, hit the Oculus button on the right controller to bring up the bottom menu. On the left, underneath the clock, is a little battery icon that gives you a rough gauge of your charge. If you click on it, it brings up the Quick Settings screen. In the top left is the exact percentage, as well as that of each of your controllers.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nLayering is not a complicated thing. It's the process of adding and removing layers of clothing to keep your body comfortable in changing weather and temperature conditions.\nBillions of dollars have been spent trying to optimize this process (and sell you stuff), but it's really very simple: Put clothing on when you're cold, take clothing off when you're hot. Which clothing? That's the rub, as they say. But don't worry. We'll walk you through what each layer is, how to layer, and when you'll want it. Once you're done here, check out our guides to the Best Puffer Jackets, Best Merino Wool, and Best Rain Jackets for more.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nLayering Basics\nThe key to layering is knowing what the layers are for and when to add and remove them. The high level overview looks like this:\n- Base layer: The layer that touches your skin. These provide some warmth, but it's equally important that they wick sweat away from your skin. Being damp means being cold.\n- Mid layer: The layer that's‚Äîwait for it‚Äîin the middle. This is the layer where you actually start insulating, or trapping body heat. This is the key to the whole system and can be more than one layer (e.g., a lightweight fleece and a puffer jacket).\n- Outer layer: The top layer is the waterproof, windproof layer that makes sure that nature does not steal all that precious heat you've retained in the mid layer. This is sometimes referred to as a ‚Äúshell.‚Äù\nWhile you won't always be wearing all of these, especially when you're exerting yourself while walking, running, et cetera, it's usually worth carrying all three. If it's cold, you can start with all three on and peel them off as you get warmer. When it's hot you can do the opposite, pulling out a shell when you stop on a windy ridge. Obviously there are situations where you don't need to carry all of them. Hiking the Florida trail in July? Skip the mid layer, ya lunatic.\nBase Layers\nLet's start with underwear. Whether boxers, briefs, boxer briefs, or bras, go for materials that are going to help move moisture away from your skin. I have found merino wool to be ideal for underwear, but it's worth trying different fabrics to find which works best for you.\nNext comes what we generally think of as base layers: relatively tight-fitting but not overly restrictive pants and shirt with the dual purpose of insulating in cold weather and wicking sweat in hot. Again, there is a wide array of fabrics. If you opt for merino wool here you'll benefit from wool's natural ability to smooth out temperature variation across your skin, keeping you more evenly warm/cool (I call this temperature modulation).\nThere are also other options for fabric here, which includes Nuyarn. It has much of the benefit of merino (it's usually more than half merino) but adds some nylon to provide extra strength and durability, as well as speeding up drying times. The latter can be important in very wet climates. In my experience, synthetic base layers do not perform as well at either insulation or moisture removal, though they will often dry faster, last longer, and are often cheaper.\nWhatever you land on in your quest for the perfect base layer, don't wear cotton. Cotton absorbs moisture like a sponge, becoming damp and leaving you wet and cold. There's an easy-to-remember saying that's good for any outdoor adventure: Cotton kills. Sorry, cotton.\nTerms:\n- Wicking: This refers to the ability of a fabric to move moisture away from you skin. This is heavily used in marketing materials but in my experience isn't what actually happens, even with merino wool. The important thing is to find a fabric that feels good against your skin and doesn't completely wet out when you're sweating.\n- Weight: This refers to the fabric weight. Most base layers will be in the 160-grams-per-square-meter (lightweight) to 260-gsm range (heavyweight or expedition weight). Anything in between is mid-weight. Which one do you need? I‚Äôd tend toward the lightweight end of spectrum unless you're headed out in serious cold. in which case you'll want heavyweight.\nThe Mid Layer\nThis is the workhorse layer of your layering system. The mid layer provides insulation to retain your body's natural heat. The better your mid layer, the warmer you stay.\nThis layer also has probably the widest range of options, everything from ultra-lightweight Alpha 60 fleece to massively overstuffed down puffer jackets. Your best bet here is to have several mid layers, based on the expected temperature range of your adventures.\nFor example, in summer, hiking in the mountains, you might go with a very lightweight fleece (fleece has its own weight system, usually 100, 200, and 300 weight) or 250-gsm wool jacket for cooler moments, and a lightly filled puffer jacket (like REI's 650 down jacket) should the weather turn nasty. In winter, your mid layers might be something like a 300-weight fleece jacket paired with a much warmer puffer.\nDespite being WIRED's official \"merino guy,\" I like fleece for a mid layer. Fleece will keep you warm even when damp, it's easy to wring out when it's wet, and it dries quickly. But what I really like is that fleece breathes well, allowing some of the heat to escape when you're exerting yourself. That means you don't have to be constantly putting your mid layer on and taking it off as your temp changes. The downside is that wind blows right through fleece. That's where the third layer comes in.\nTerms:\n- Weight: This still refers to fabric weight, but mid layers will be in the 180-gsm, which is lightweight, to 300-gsm range for wool, 100-300 range for fleece, and puffer jackets with anywhere from 2.5 to 10 ounces of fill. (For our explanation on what fill means, check out our Down Fill Power guide.) The more mid layer options you have, the better you can pair your layers to your trip, which is why I tend to go for cheaper options here like REI's house brand.\nThe Outer Layer or Shell\nI like the term shell here because it capture exactly what this layer does. It provides a shell over the other layers to protect them from wind and rain. This layer has a tremendous range of options, from the ultralight and ultracheap Frogg Toggs (a thru-hiker favorite) to high tech \"expedition\" jackets that run to the thousands of dollars.\nThere is no one right option here, and again it's worth experimenting to see what works for you. We have a whole guide to rain jackets to help you figure out the right one for you. It helps to be realistic about what you're doing. If you're mountaineering or live in a very wet climate, by all means invest in something heavy-duty. If you're just looking to shed the occasional shower and stay warm atop those high passes, you might not need something as heavy-duty.\nI know it seems crazy, but grab a set of Frogg Toggs and go for a walk around your neighborhood in the rain and see what they're like. If you're miserable, send them back to Amazon and try some of the cheaper rain jackets we like.\nMy experience has been that a jacket can be waterproof or it can be breathable, but it cannot be both at the same time. I have a couple of shell jackets to use, depending on the scenario. For day hikes I tend to bring along something ultralight like Patagonia's Houdini jacket, which is primarily a wind jacket, though it will repel some rain (not much though).\nIf I'm going for a longer period of time or expect rain, I bring a sil-nylon jacket of some sort. Sil-nylon is 100 percent waterproof but doesn't breathe at all, so look for jackets with pit zips and other means to ventilate. I recently picked up a poncho like the one I had when I was backpacking as a kid in the 1980s. My hope is that it might ventilate better than a jacket, but I haven't tested it yet.\nPutting It All Together\nI find it easiest to think of layer in terms of use cases. Here are a few scenarios for different environments and seasons to get you started in figuring a layering system that works for your adventures.\nKeep in mind that environmental conditions aren't the only consideration. Think about how hard you'll be exerting yourself and how your body does under these conditions. If you're a perpetually cold person, bring heavier mid layers. If you tend to run hot, you might be able to get away with less. That said, here are some common hiking/backpacking situations and some sample layers to get you through them.\n- Summer mountain backpacking layers: Grab a lightweight merino base layer like Smartwool's classic all-season merino and pair it with a midweight fleece jacket and ultralight down jacket. Top that off with a waterproof rain jacket. If you're day hiking, you can probably go with just one mid layer.\n- Fall backpacking at lower elevations: Start with a heavier base layer, like this midweight option from Icebreaker, then add a midweight fleece jacket and midweight down jacket like our favorite from Katabatic Gear. For a shell you might want something heavier like the Arc'Teryx Beta.\n- Spring in the desert: Warm days, cold nights‚Äîthe trickiest layering situation you'll encounter. I'd go with a midweight merino top, but lightweight merino pants for the baselayer, along with a midweight down jacket and a lightweight fleece. For the shell, you could probably get away with a wind shell like the Patagonia Houdini and maybe a poncho for rain.\n- Spring in Florida: Lightweight merino T-shirt. Flip flops. Ah, Florida.\nGot layering questions? Drop them in comments below and we'll do our best to test and answer them in future updates to this guide.",

The high level overview looks like this:</p><ul class=\"paywall\"><li><strong>Base layer</strong>: The layer that touches your skin. These provide some warmth, but it's equally important that they wick sweat away from your skin. Being damp means being cold.</li><li><strong>Mid layer</strong>: The layer that's‚Äîwait for it‚Äîin the middle. This is the layer where you actually start insulating, or trapping body heat. This is the key to the whole system and can be more than one layer (e.g., a lightweight fleece and a puffer jacket).</li><li><strong>Outer layer</strong>: The top layer is the waterproof, windproof layer that makes sure that nature does not steal all that precious heat you've retained in the mid layer. This is sometimes referred to as a ‚Äúshell.‚Äù</li></ul><p class=\"paywall\">While you won't always be wearing all of these, especially when you're exerting yourself while walking, running, et cetera, it's usually worth carrying all three. If it's cold, you can start with all three on and peel them off as you get warmer. When it's hot you can do the opposite, pulling out a shell when you stop on a windy ridge. Obviously there are situations where you don't need to carry all of them. Hiking the Florida trail in July? Skip the mid layer, ya lunatic.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Base Layers</h2><div class=\"CalloutFeatureLargeWrapper-cAQNly bLNMaC\" data-testid=\"feature-large-callout\"><div

    "content_text": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\nResearchers at Microsoft have announced the creation of the first ‚Äútopological qubits‚Äù in a device that stores information in an exotic state of matter, in what may be a significant breakthrough for quantum computing.\nAt the same time, the researchers also published a paper in Nature and a ‚Äúroad map‚Äù for further work. The design of the Majorana 1 processor is supposed to fit up to a million qubits, which may be enough to realize many significant goals of quantum computing‚Äîsuch as cracking cryptographic codes and designing new drugs and materials faster.\nIf Microsoft‚Äôs claims pan out, the company may have leapfrogged competitors such as IBM and Google, who currently appear to be leading the race to build a quantum computer.\nHowever, the peer-reviewed Nature paper only shows part of what the researchers have claimed, and the road map still includes many hurdles to be overcome. While the Microsoft press release shows off something that is supposed to be quantum computing hardware, we don‚Äôt have any independent confirmation of what it can do. Nevertheless, the news from Microsoft is very promising.\nBy now you probably have some questions. What‚Äôs a topological qubit? What‚Äôs a qubit at all, for that matter? And why do people want quantum computers in the first place?\nQuantum Bits Are Hard to Build\nQuantum computers were first dreamed up in the 1980s. Where an ordinary computer stores information in bits, a quantum computer stores information in quantum bits‚Äîor qubits.\nAn ordinary bit can have a value of 0 or 1, but a quantum bit (thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics, which govern very small particles) can have a combination of both. If you imagine an ordinary bit as an arrow that can point either up or down, a qubit is an arrow that can point in any direction (or what is called a ‚Äúsuperposition‚Äù of up and down).\nThis means a quantum computer would be much faster than an ordinary computer for certain kinds of calculations‚Äîparticularly some to do with unpicking codes and simulating natural systems.\nSo far, so good. But it turns out that building real qubits and getting information in and out of them is extremely difficult, because interactions with the outside world can destroy the delicate quantum states inside.\nResearchers have tried a lot of different technologies to make qubits, using things like atoms trapped in electric fields or eddies of current swirling in superconductors.\nTiny Wires and Exotic Particles\nMicrosoft has taken a very different approach to build its ‚Äútopological qubits.‚Äù They have used what are called Majorana particles, first theorized in 1937 by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana.\nMajoranas are not naturally occurring particles like electrons or protons. Instead, they only exist inside a rare kind of material called a topological superconductor (which requires advanced material design and must be cooled down to extremely low temperatures).\nIndeed, Majorana particles are so exotic they are usually only studied in universities‚Äînot used in practical applications.\nThe Microsoft team say they have used a pair of tiny wires, each with a Majorana particle trapped at either end, to act as a qubit. They measure the value of the qubit‚Äîexpressed by means of whether an electron is in one wire or the other‚Äîusing microwaves.\nBraided Bits\nWhy has Microsoft put in all this effort? Because by swapping the positions of Majorana particles (or measuring them in a certain way), they can be ‚Äúbraided‚Äù so they can be measured without error and are resistant to outside interference. (This is the ‚Äútopological‚Äù part of ‚Äútopological qubits.‚Äù)\nIn theory, a quantum computer made using Majorana particles can be completely free of the qubit errors that plague other designs.\nThis is why Microsoft has chosen such a seemingly laborious approach. Other technologies are more prone to errors, and hundreds of physical qubits may need to be combined together to produce a single reliable ‚Äúlogical qubit.‚Äù\nMicrosoft has instead put its time and resources into developing Majorana-based qubits. While the company is late to the quantum party, it hopes to catch up quickly.\nThere‚Äôs Always a Catch\nAs always, if something sounds too good to be true, there is a catch. Even for a Majorana-based quantum computer, such as the one announced by Microsoft, one operation‚Äîknown as T-gate‚Äîwon‚Äôt be achievable without errors.\nSo the Majorana-based quantum chip is only ‚Äúalmost error-free.‚Äù However, correcting for T-gate errors is much simpler than the general error correction of other quantum platforms.\nWhat now? Microsoft will try to move ahead with its road map, steadily building larger and larger collections of qubits.\nThe scientific community will closely watch how Microsoft‚Äôs quantum computing processors operate, and how they perform in comparison to the other already established quantum computing processors.\nAt the same time, research into the exotic and obscure behavior of Majorana particles will continue at universities around the globe.",

And why do people want quantum computers in the first place?</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Quantum Bits Are Hard to Build</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Quantum computers were first dreamed up in the 1980s. Where an ordinary computer stores information in bits, a quantum computer stores information in quantum bits‚Äîor qubits.</p><p class=\"paywall\">An ordinary bit can have a value of 0 or 1, but a quantum bit (thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics, which govern very small particles) can have a combination of both. If you imagine an ordinary bit as an arrow that can point either up or down, a qubit is an arrow that can point in any direction (or what is called a ‚Äúsuperposition‚Äù of up and down).</p><p class=\"paywall\">This means a quantum computer would be much faster than an ordinary computer for certain kinds of calculations‚Äîparticularly some to do with unpicking codes and simulating natural systems.</p><p class=\"paywall\">So far, so good. But it turns out that building real qubits and getting information in and out of them is extremely difficult, because interactions with the outside world can destroy the delicate quantum states inside.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Researchers have tried a lot of different technologies to make qubits, using things like atoms trapped in electric fields or eddies of current swirling in superconductors.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Tiny Wires and Exotic Particles</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Microsoft has taken a very different approach to build its ‚Äútopological qubits.‚Äù They have used what are called Majorana particles, first theorized in 1937 by Italian physicist Ettore Majorana.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Majoranas are not naturally occurring particles like electrons or protons. Instead, they only exist inside a rare kind of material called a topological superconductor (which requires advanced material design and must be cooled down to extremely low temperatures).</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nJust four West African countries are the foundation of an industry worth more than $100 billion. In the tropical nations of C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, Ghana, Cameroon, and Nigeria, rows of cacao trees sprout pods bearing dozens of seeds. Once harvested, these humble beans are dried, roasted, and processed into something beloved worldwide.\nChocolate has been coveted for millennia and, particularly on Valentine‚Äôs Day, is an unmistakable token of love. But as increasingly erratic weather continues driving up the costs of confectionery, the sweet treat has become a symbol of something much less romantic: climate change.\nTwo reports published last week found that warming is pushing temperatures beyond the optimal range for cacao growth in the countries at the heart of the world‚Äôs supply, particularly during primary harvest seasons. The research reveals how burning oil, coal, and methane is roasting the planet‚Äôs cocoa belt and skyrocketing chocolate prices.\n‚ÄúOne of the foods that the world most loves is at risk because of climate change,‚Äù said Kristina Dahl, vice president for science at the nonprofit Climate Central, which wrote one of the two reports. ‚ÄúI would hope that by hearing that human activity is making it harder to grow cocoa, it might cause people to stop and think about our priorities as a species, and whether we can and should be prioritizing actions to limit future climate change and future harms to this food that we love so much.‚Äù\nAbout 70 percent of the world‚Äôs cacao is grown in West Africa, with C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, Ghana, Cameroon, and Nigeria the biggest producers. The bulk of the rest is grown in places with similar climates not far from the equator, such as Indonesia and Ecuador. The trees grow best in rainforest conditions with high humidity, abundant rain, nitrogen-rich soil, and natural wind buffers. Exposure to temperatures higher than 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit prompts water stress, hinders plant growth, and erodes the quality and quantity of seeds the trees yield.\nLast year, warming added at least six weeks‚Äô worth of days above that threshold in nearly two-thirds of cacao-producing areas across C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, Ghana, Cameroon, and Nigeria, likely contributing to a disastrous harvest, according to the Climate Central report.\nThe researchers examined temperature data for the region and estimates of what might have been experienced over the past decade in a world without human-induced warming. They found that between 2015 and 2024, climate change increased the number of days each country experiences temperature ranges above the ideal for cacao growth by an average of two to four weeks annually. Most of those hotter days came during the main crop cycle, when the plants bloom and produce beans. Warming is also altering rain patterns, accelerating droughts, facilitating the spread of devastating diseases like pod rot, and contributing to soil degradation. Another new study found low rates of pollination and higher-than-average temperatures in Ghana have combined to limit yields.\nBut teasing out just how much of an impact climate change has had on production and consumer prices remains largely unchartered by scientists and economists. Dahl also said it‚Äôs unknown which weather phenomenon is behind the largest impact on production, nor is it clear what influence El Ni√±o had on last year‚Äôs harvests.\nEmmanuel Essah-Mensah, a cocoa grower in Ghana, described climate change as one of the most serious problems affecting production throughout West Africa. ‚ÄúThe drought means we are losing 60 percent of our cocoa plants. I have seen a drastic decline in income, as have all the farmers in my farming cooperative,‚Äù Essah-Mensah told Grist.\nDroughts, floods, and plant diseases thrashing the region last year contributed to record cocoa prices, which in turn caused the cost of chocolate to jump, according to a report by the nonprofit Christian Aid, which works toward sustainable development and economic justice. Global cocoa production fell by about 14 percent in the 2023-24 season, and ahead of Valentine‚Äôs Day last year, the soaring price of cocoa on the futures market shattered a 47-year record.\nKat Kramer, coauthor of the report and a climate policy consultant for the nonprofit, said the findings, and those of Climate Central, expose the industry‚Äôs vulnerability to climate change. ‚ÄúChocolate lovers need to push companies and their governments to cut greenhouse gas emissions,‚Äù said Kramer, ‚Äúotherwise chocolate supplies will tragically be at increasing climate risk.‚Äù\nThe implications of this go beyond what it means for this delectable delicacy. Cocoa also is used in other goods like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, which account for a significant piece of the global market. Yet chocolate remains king, with the US importing around $2.8 billion worth of it every year‚Äîover 10 percent of the world‚Äôs supply.\nFederal Reserve data suggests that global cocoa prices rose 144 percent in December, more than doubling from the year before, said Alla Semenova, an economist at St. Mary‚Äôs College of Maryland. This is known as the producer price, or what global chocolate manufacturers pay those who process the raw beans. Still, that cost is often absorbed by confectionary customers. ‚ÄúWhen producer prices rise, when the costs of production rise, consumer prices rise,‚Äù said Semenova.\nYet even as prices go up, the farmers raising cacao don‚Äôt always see any of that profit. Josephine George Francis, who produces the crop alongside coffee on her farm in Liberia, said farmers throughout West Africa actually lose money due to the rising cost of growing crops in a warming world. ‚ÄúWe need a different approach that puts sustainability and farmers at its heart,‚Äù said George Francis. ‚ÄúWe do not benefit from increased prices on world markets.‚Äù\nOf course, cocoa isn‚Äôt the only ingredient in confectioneries threatened by warming. Early last year, sugar, another essential ingredient, sold at some of the highest prices in over a decade after extreme weather constrained global sugarcane production.\n‚ÄúIt is not just the quantity of cocoa production that is affected by the acceleration of climate change,‚Äù said Semenova. ‚ÄúThe type and the quality of the ingredients that go into the production of chocolate will change.‚Äù\nAll of this has led many chocolatiers to adapt. Some, like Mars and Hershey, have been quietly reducing the amount of cocoa or even introducing new treats that eliminate it entirely. As prices continue to rise, analysts expect to see demand wane, a trend even Valentine‚Äôs Day can‚Äôt stop.",

And stay safe out there.\n$1.4 Billion Stolen From ByBit in Biggest Crypto Theft Ever\nRunning a cryptocurrency exchange is a risky business, as hacking victims like Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, FTX, and plenty of others can attest. But never before has a platform for buying and selling crypto lost a 10-figure dollar sum in a single heist. That new record belongs to ByBit, which on Friday revealed that thieves hacked its Ethereum-based holdings. The hackers made off with a sum that totals to $1.4 billion, according to an estimate by cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic‚Äîthe largest crypto theft of all time by some measures.\nByBit CEO Ben Zhou wrote on X that the hackers had used a ‚Äúmusked transaction‚Äù‚Äîlikely a misspelling of ‚Äúmasked transaction‚Äù‚Äîto trick the exchange into cryptographically signing a change in the code of the smart contract controlling a wallet holding its stockpile of Ethereum. ‚ÄúPlease rest assured that all other cold wallets are secure,‚Äù Zhou wrote, suggesting that the exchange remained solvent. ‚ÄúAll withdraws are NORMAL.‚Äù Zhou later added in another note on X that the exchange would be able to cover the loss, which if true suggests that no users will lose their funds.\nThe theft dwarfs other historic hacks of crypto exchanges like Mt. Gox and FTX, each of which lost sums of cryptocurrency that were worth hundreds of millions of dollars at the time the thefts were discovered. Even the stolen loot from the 2016 Bitfinex heist, which was worth close to $4.5 billion at the time the thieves were identified and the majority of the funds recovered in 2022, was only worth $72 million at the time of the theft. ByBit‚Äôs $1.4 billion is by that measure a far bigger loss and, considering that all crypto thefts in 2024 totaled to $2.2 billion, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, a stunning new benchmark in crypto crime.\nBowing to a Government Demand, Apple Disables iCloud End-to-End Encryption in the UK\nThe British government earlier this month raised privacy alarms worldwide when it demanded that Apple give it access to users‚Äô end-to-end encrypted iCloud data. That data had been protected with Apple‚Äôs Advanced Data Protection feature, which encrypts stored user information such that no one other than the user can decrypt it‚Äînot even Apple. Now Apple has caved to the UK‚Äôs pressure, disabling that end-to-end encryption feature for iCloud across the country. Even as it turned off that protection, Apple expressed its reluctance in a statement: \"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end-encryption is more urgent than ever before,\" the company said. \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK.\" Privacy advocates worldwide have argued that the move‚Äîand the UK‚Äôs push for it‚Äîwill weaken the security and privacy of British citizens and leave tech companies vulnerable to similar surveillance demands from other governments around the world.\nCocospy and Spyic Stalkerware Apps Expose Millions of Victims‚Äô Data Online\nThe only thing worse than the scourge of stalkerware apps‚Äîmalware installed on phones by snooping spouses or other hands-on spies to surveil virtually all of the victim‚Äôs movements and communications‚Äîis when those apps are so badly secured that they also leak victims‚Äô information onto the internet. Stalkerware apps Cocospy and Spyic, which appear to have been developed by someone in China and largely share the same source code, left data stolen from millions of victims exposed, thanks to a security vulnerability in both apps, according to a security researcher who discovered the flaw and shared information about it with TechCrunch. The exposed data included messages, call logs, and photos, TechCrunch found. In a karmic twist, it also included millions of email addresses of the stalkerware‚Äôs registered users, who had themselves installed the apps to spy on victims.",

And stay safe out there.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Running a cryptocurrency exchange is a risky business, as hacking victims like Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, FTX, and plenty of others can attest. But never before has a platform for buying and selling crypto lost a 10-figure dollar sum in a single heist. That new record belongs to ByBit, which on Friday revealed that thieves hacked its Ethereum-based holdings. The hackers made off with a sum that totals to $1.4 billion, according to an estimate by cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic‚Äîthe largest crypto theft of all time by some measures.</p><p class=\"paywall\">ByBit CEO Ben Zhou wrote on X that the hackers had used a ‚Äúmusked transaction‚Äù‚Äîlikely a misspelling of ‚Äúmasked transaction‚Äù‚Äîto trick the exchange into cryptographically signing a change in the code of the smart contract controlling a wallet holding its stockpile of Ethereum. ‚ÄúPlease rest assured that all other cold wallets are secure,‚Äù Zhou wrote, suggesting that the exchange remained solvent. ‚ÄúAll withdraws are NORMAL.‚Äù Zhou later added in another note on X that the exchange would be able to cover the loss, which if true suggests that no users will lose their funds.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The theft dwarfs other historic hacks of crypto exchanges like Mt. Gox and FTX, each of which lost sums of cryptocurrency that were worth hundreds of millions of dollars at the time the thefts were discovered. Even the stolen loot from the 2016 Bitfinex heist, which was worth close to $4.5 billion at the time the thieves were identified and the majority of the funds recovered in 2022, was only worth $72 million at the time of the theft. ByBit‚Äôs $1.4 billion is by that measure a far bigger loss and, considering that all crypto thefts in 2024 totaled to $2.2 billion, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, a stunning new benchmark in crypto crime.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The British government earlier this month raised privacy alarms worldwide when it demanded that Apple give it access to users‚Äô end-to-end encrypted iCloud data. That data had been protected with Apple‚Äôs Advanced Data Protection feature, which encrypts stored user information such that no one other than the user can decrypt it‚Äînot even Apple. Now Apple has caved to the UK‚Äôs pressure, disabling that end-to-end encryption feature for iCloud across the country. Even as it turned off that protection, Apple expressed its reluctance in a statement: \"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end-encryption is more urgent than ever before,\" the company said. \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK.\" Privacy advocates worldwide have argued that the move‚Äîand the UK‚Äôs push for it‚Äîwill weaken the security and privacy of British citizens and leave tech companies vulnerable to similar surveillance demands from other governments around the world.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The only thing worse than the scourge of stalkerware apps‚Äîmalware installed on phones by snooping spouses or other hands-on spies to surveil virtually all of the victim‚Äôs movements and communications‚Äîis when those apps are so badly secured that they also leak victims‚Äô information onto the internet. Stalkerware apps Cocospy and Spyic, which appear to have been developed by someone in China and largely share the same source code, left data stolen from millions of victims exposed, thanks to a security vulnerability in both apps, according to a security researcher who discovered the flaw and shared information about it with TechCrunch. The exposed data included messages, call logs, and photos, TechCrunch found. In a karmic twist, it also included millions of email addresses of the stalkerware‚Äôs registered users, who had themselves installed the apps to spy on victims.</p></div></div></body></html>",

This week, the company announced that HP‚Äîknown for its computers and printers that always seem to need a refill‚Äîwill acquire several assets from Humane in a $116 million deal expected to close at the end of the month.\nHP will get more than 300 patents and patent applications, a few Humane employees‚Äîincluding founders Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno‚Äîand Humane's Cosmos operating system. Late in 2024, Humane looked to license this operating system so that third parties could inject the AI voice assistant into other products, like cars. However, nothing materialized.\nHumane became Silicon Valley's ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù in late 2023 when it unveiled its AI wearable, equipped with a ChatGPT-powered assistant and a laser-projected display, that promised to replace your smartphone. But when reviews arrived at launch in 2024‚Äîyou can read ours here‚Äîit was panned. The issues were seemingly endless: It frequently overheated; the AI hallucinated often; there were hardly any useful features; the projector was annoying ‚Ä¶ and so on.\nUnsurprisingly, HP doesn't want to do much with the Ai Pin hardware. Sales have effectively stopped, and Humane will issue refunds to anyone who bought a pin after November 15, 2024 (if you did, why?). Existing Ai Pins will cease to function after noon Pacific on February 28. Almost every core feature will stop working‚Äîbut you can still find out how much battery is left!‚Äîand your data will be deleted, so make sure you sync and download it now.\nAs for HP, it plans to integrate Humane's Cosmos AI into its products to ‚Äúunlock new levels of functionality for our customers and deliver on the promises of AI.‚Äù Good luck with that. In the meantime, Humane engineers will form a group called HP IQ, an innovation lab that will apparently build an ecosystem of smart features throughout HP's line of products. Maybe that'll mean a printer that will finally not drive its user crazy? Fingers crossed.\nAll the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:\n- Apple‚Äôs New iPhone 16e Kills Off the iPhone SE\n- There‚Äôs No Longer a Sub-$500 iPhone. Does It Matter?\n- Review: Long Live OnePlus‚Äô 5-Day Battery King of Smartwatches\nApple Improves the Vision Pro‚Äôs Guest Mode\nApple announced this week that Apple Intelligence will be coming to its Vision Pro headset as a part of visionOS 2.4, though the update is expected to roll out in April. It doesn't just bring the suite of artificial intelligence features‚Äîlike ChatGPT-powered writing assistance, Genmoji, and Image Playground‚Äîit claims to greatly improve the guest experience on Vision Pro.\nCurrently, if you want to let someone try the Vision Pro, the owner has to wear it first to authenticate and unlock the headset, and then enable Guest Mode. Running visionOS 2.4, guests can wear the headset, and owners will receive a notification on their iPhone or iPad (which needs to be nearby) to allow access. AVP owners can also now choose what apps guests can see, and guests can save their eye and hand setup for up to 30 days so they won't have to run through the tutorial and setup of the headset every time.\nA new app‚ÄîSpatial Gallery‚Äîis also bundled into visionOS 2.4. Curated by Apple, it will feature spatial videos, photos, and panoramas designed to be viewed on the headset. Apple says you can expect new content regularly from photographers, brands, and behind-the-scenes moments from Apple Originals like Severance.\nThere are several other minor features in visionOS 2.4, but one notable addition is tied to the rollout of iOS 18.4. In April, Apple Vision Pro owners will magically find a new app on their iPhone running iOS 18.4 (it will also be available to download for everyone else). The app is called Apple Vision Pro, and it's designed to let you discover new content to enjoy on the Vision Pro, allowing you to queue up a movie or remotely download an app so that you don't need to spend extra time in that headset you dropped $3,500 on. The app will also feature tips and headset software information, too.\nOn a related note about Apple Intelligence, Apple confirmed this week that Visual Intelligence (which lets you use the iPhone 16 camera with a ChatGPT-powered Siri to identify and learn more about objects around you) will come to the iPhone 15 Pro models in a software update. This comes after the announcement of the iPhone 16e, where Visual Intelligence is baked into the Action Button. iPhone 15 Pro users can trigger it via the Action Button or the Control Center.\nEero Debuts Cheaper Wi-Fi 7 Mesh Routers\nEvery new version of Wi-Fi brings faster speeds, better security, and enhanced stability. The first wave of routers is always super expensive, and there‚Äôs little point in updating until you have devices that support the new standard. But now that the latest phones and laptops support Wi-Fi 7, companies like Eero are introducing reasonably priced Wi-Fi 7 mesh routers. Say hello to the Eero 7 and Eero Pro 7, announced this week and shipping on February 26.\nBuilding out its Wi-Fi 7 range, the Eero 7 is the dual-band (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) entry-level option, which promises wireless speeds up to 1.8 Gbps and two 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports on each router. An Eero 7 two-pack can cover up to 4,000 square feet, and, though it lacks the speedy 6-GHz band, it does offer all the other goodies Wi-Fi 7 has in store, including enhanced WPA3 security, Multi-Link Operation (MLO) to connect on multiple bands and channels simultaneously, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) for more connected devices, and 4K-QAM to pack more data into each signal.\nThe Eero Pro 7 is the Goldilocks mesh that will be right for most folks. This tri-band middle child adds the 6-GHz band for rapid and stable short-range Wi-Fi. Each unit has two 5-Gbps Ethernet ports and can hit wireless speeds of 3.9 Gbps, making it a solid choice for folks with multi-gig internet connections. Each Eero Pro 7 router can handle 200 devices and covers around 2,000 square feet.\nEero‚Äôs routers are fully backward compatible with earlier Eero systems and Wi-Fi versions. That means you can snag a single Eero Pro 7 to mix and match with your existing Eero mesh. Both systems double as smart home hubs with Matter, Thread, and Zigbee support. For an extra $10 a month, or $100 a year, you can add Eero Plus for parental controls, internet backup, advanced security, ad-blocking, and third-party services (password manager, VPN, and antivirus).\nYou can preorder the Eero Pro 7 today for $300 (one-pack), $550 (two-pack), or $700 (three-pack), and they ship next week. For more modest needs, the Eero 7 is $170 (one-pack), $280 (two-pack), or $350 (three-pack). ‚ÄîSimon Hill\nOppo Claims Its Folding Phone Is the Thinnest\nThe race to slim down folding phones continues with Oppo‚Äôs Find N5 the latest to claim the thinnest title at just 8.93 mm when closed (4.2 mm when open), narrowly beating the Honor Magic V3, which sits at 9.2 mm. The Oppo Find N5 is very lightweight too at 229 grams, with a flat frame that makes it easy to handle, and a smooth hinge that feels durable. It has an IPX9 and IPX8 rating for water resistance, meaning it can withstand submersion or jets of water. Great news if you like to shower with your phone.\nThere‚Äôs a 6.62-inch cover display, and the Find N5 opens to reveal a tablet-sized 8.12-inch inner screen. Yes, you can see the crease, but it‚Äôs relatively subtle. Both displays are sharp, support up to 120-Hz refresh rate, and can peak at 2,000 nits brightness for HDR content. The slim dual-cell silicon-carbon batteries inside are rated at 5,600 mAh, enough to see you through a busy day with change. Oppo‚Äôs proprietary charging standards allow 80-watt wired charging or 50-watt wireless charging with the right accessories. You‚Äôll find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset inside, and my review unit has a generous 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage.\nThere's a triple-lens main camera in the Find N5, combining a 50-megapixel shooter with a large aperture and sensor for better low-light performance, a 50-megapixel periscope telephoto lens enabling 3X optical zoom, and an 8-MP ultrawide. Cutouts at the top right of the inner display and the top center of the outer display house basic 8-megapixel cameras for selfies and video calls.\nIt wouldn't be a new phone launch without a mention of AI, and these include AI-assisted call summaries, dual-screen translation, and photo-editing tools. What stands out is O+ Connect, Oppo‚Äôs software bridge for Apple‚Äôs macOS, allowing Oppo owners to access their MacBook remotely, drag and drop files from the Find N5 to the laptop or vice versa, and even mirror the desktop to transform a folded Find N5 into a mini MacBook.\nThe Oppo Find N5 is available in Singapore now for $2,499 SGD (around $1,867), and will be coming to the UK and Europe soon, but not the US. Oppo hardware sometimes gets rebadged by OnePlus for the US‚Äîboth are owned by the same parent company‚Äîbut OnePlus has already confirmed it won‚Äôt release a folding phone in 2025. That's a real shame for Americans, as this is one of the best folding phones we‚Äôve seen. ‚ÄîSimon Hill\nEufy‚Äôs Latest Smart Lock Can Read Palms\nIt might sound like Eufy is foraying into the world of psychics and palm reading, but it's not as magical as that. The company just announced a new smart lock‚Äîthe FamiLock S3 Max‚Äîthat uses palm-vein recognition technology as a form of biometric reading to unlock your front door.\nThe palm reading is touch-free, unlike locks that use fingerprint scanners. It uses an infrared sensor to scan and recognize each person's unique vein signature. Eufy claims it works quickly and is user-friendly for all ages, allowing older family members and kids to wave their hands in front of the lock and get inside.\nThe FamiLock has an integrated doorbell and camera with a 150-degree vertical head-to-toe view and a 180-degree diagonal view, letting it double as a video doorbell that will alert you about package deliveries and movement. You can also add an internal video screen to see through the camera on the inside, like a digital peephole. It sounds a little redundant if you have an actual peephole, but it might be better for kids or folks not tall enough to check the peephole to see if it‚Äôs someone they know at the door.\nOther features include a door sensor, dual power supply, and compatibility with several smart home platforms and Matter. You can reserve it now for $1 and get a discount, but the FamiLock officially launches on March 17. It starts at $349, though the screen add-on brings the total to $399. ‚ÄîNena Farrell\nDacia Is Making a Sub-$19K Electric City Car\nDacia? Yes Dacia (or ‚ÄúDah-chee-ah‚Äù), the Romanian automaker part of the Renault Group, known for cheap and cheerful cars at surprisingly good value. It's enjoying something of a purple patch right now in Europe, thanks to a remarkably effective redesign of its well-reviewed Duster small SUV, as well as the just-launched larger version, the Bigster. Dacia already has a staggeringly cheap EV on the market, the Spring‚Äîwe tried it and were won over by its diminutive charms‚Äîbut it appears this is not good enough for Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo.\nWhile announcing the Renault Group‚Äôs financial performance in 2024 this week, de Meo let slip that the as-yet-unnamed new city Dacia will be priced at less than $19,000. What's more, the turnaround for this city EV will be fast‚Äîdeveloped and ready for production in just 16 months. ‚ÄúI defy any competitor in the world to do that,‚Äù de Meo said, ‚Äúincluding the Chinese when they come to Europe.‚Äù\nThe new model, which Dacia says will only use 750 parts (!!) to keep costs down, likely won't replace the Spring, as that itself is relatively new. However, the Spring is built in China and will therefore be subject to any tariffs on Chinese EVs, If this new model is EU-made, then it would circumvent such tariffs, and it could also probably improve on the Spring's 140-mile range. ‚ÄîJeremy White\nDJI Has Two New Gimbals\nGimbals aren't often talked about enough, but they can be vital in delivering stable video footage, whether you're shooting on your smartphone or a professional camera. DJI this week unveiled two gimbals, designed for both of those respective platforms. The Osmo Mobile 7P and Osmo Mobile 7 are meant for smartphones, whereas the RS 4 Mini can be used with cameras and smartphones.\nThe Osmo Mobile 7P now comes with a Multifunctional Module, an attachment that adds capabilities like enabling subject tracking with a hand gesture. While the Mobile 7 supports the module, you have to buy it separately if you want it. Since it's not included, it's much more lightweight at 300 grams and is cheaper. The Mobile 7P costs $149 and the Mobile 7 is $89, and both are available for purchase now.\nThe DJI RS 4 Mini is in a different class altogether, with a starting price of $369. DJI promises speedier setups with this gimbal, including a faster way to switch to filming vertically. The stabilization has been upgraded, especially with vertical video, and battery life is longer (up to 13 hours) with fast-charging support. It also now supports intelligent subject tracking via the tracking module, similar to the Multifunctional Module on the Osmo Mobile 7P. It's also available now.\nThis Is Omega‚Äôs New Seamaster Diver 300M\nCan we resist a James Bronze joke? Clearly not. Omega this week unveiled the next version of its iconic diving watch, the Seamaster Diver 300M, but this time resplendent in ‚ÄúBronze Gold.‚Äù As Vin Diesel‚Äìadjacent yacht lord Jeff Bezos takes to social media to canvas ideas on who should be the next fictional British secret agent, true to form Omega relied on previous incumbent Daniel Craig to tease the latest Seamaster some months ago, but now it has officially dropped.\nWith more than a passing nod to the previous 300M 007 Edition launched in 2020 for No Time to Die, this 42-mm piece showcases Omega's proprietary Bronze Gold alloy, which is actually made of palladium, silver, and 37.5 percent gold. Unlike standard bronze, however, Omega's alloy supposedly has superior corrosion resistance, ‚Äútherefore aging slowly and retaining its natural patina over a longer period of time‚Äù according to the watch brand.\nThe matte black dial features PVD18K Bronze Gold hands, and blackened indices filled with vintage-look Super-LumiNova, which all sit above Omega's METAS-certified Co-Axial Master Chronometer Calibre 8806. OMEGA is offering two different options for the wrist. You can opt for an integrated black rubber strap with a Bronze Gold buckle at $13,900, but despite the significant extra outlay, we'd recommend the $27,900 brushed Bronze Gold mesh bracelet version. And if this look is a bit too Auric Goldfinger for you, no one could go wrong with the stylish $6,500 steel version. ‚ÄîJeremy White\nAmbient IoT Alliance, Assemble\nThe news of the formation of the Ambient IoT Alliance came via a dry press release, but a cross-industry coalition to establish an open, interoperable, multi-standard ecosystem for ambient internet-of-things products is exciting news. No, really. If you‚Äôre wondering, ambient IoT is all about finding ways to power small devices like trackers and sensors by harvesting ambient energy from the immediate environment, which could be radio waves, light, motion, heat, or any other viable energy source. With ambient IoT, there‚Äôs no need to make small, wasteful batteries or find ways to wirelessly power over distance.\nAmbient IoT-enabled devices might detect location, temperature, humidity, and other things, feeding data back through the wireless infrastructure created by our smart appliances, phones, and wireless access points. From accurate package tracking to E Ink shelf tags in-store, this could be meaningful for supply chain management, retail, and health care, which is why the founding members are such a diverse group, including Atmosic, Infineon Technologies AG, Intel, PepsiCo, Qualcomm, VusionGroup, and Wiliot.\nThe underlying technologies for ambient IoT are varied, so the Alliance aims to define them within the global communications standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth SIG, and 3GPP (5G Advanced). Steve Statler, spokesperson for the Ambient IoT Alliance, told WIRED that ambient IoT could make it affordable for companies to track packages in real time with stickers containing a small chip capable of harvesting radio frequency signals for energy. Then it can broadcast a stronger signal to share its location and potentially other data including temperature, crucial for some medications and food products.\nWhat begins as a B2B technology for better inventory and supply-chain management has many other potential future applications. Statler suggests a tag on designer clothing may not just prove authenticity, but track provenance and even record how often it has been worn or washed. In the short term, food safety is another potential application, as this kind of tracking could close the loop for recalls, making it much faster and easier to track contaminated batches of foodstuffs.\nThere‚Äôs still much to figure out. Delivering on the original promise of ambient IoT will generate huge amounts of data; there are privacy concerns with tracking; and it will be a challenge to get everyone on board with open standards and interoperability, as we have seen in the smart home space with Matter. That said, an alliance is a vital first step. ‚ÄîSimon Hill\nThermomix Dramatically Reveals the TM7!\nThe seventh-generation Thermomix blender is coming. German maker Vorwerk announced the news on Valentine‚Äôs Day with the most jaw-droppingly dramatic kitchen device trailer I‚Äôve ever seen. (‚ÄúPhygital like never before!‚Äù)\nBut do you even Thermomix? Since the device‚Äôs charmingly analog first-generation device in 1971, the Thermomix has evolved into a much-parodied culinary obsession in Europe and Australia‚Äîa $1,600 all-in-one robo-cooker that‚Äôll make soup, stir your risotto, and bake your bread. The Thermomix is a powerful blender, food processor, and induction heater that also stirs and weighs ingredients, gives recipe advice on its Cookidoo app, and crafts shopping lists (no, seriously). Though it‚Äôs a legacy brand in Europe, Thermomix still isn‚Äôt that well known in the US. WIRED contributor Joe Ray is a big, big fan, and so apparently is The French Laundry‚Äôs Thomas Keller.\nThe forthcoming Thermomix TM7, now on preorder in Europe and arriving later this year in the US, will join the smart kitchen in earnest. There‚Äôll be a king-sized 10-inch touchscreen, smartphone integration, custom recipes tied to each user, and a ‚Äúdigital twin‚Äù that‚Äôll show you in graphic form what‚Äôs happening inside the trophy-shaped, matte-black heater-chopper-blending-thing. But especially, Vorwerk is also touting some firmware updates that‚Äôll include AI-assisted recipes and voice operation. The AI robo-cooking world may soon be quite crowded. But maybe this means the times are finally picking up what the Thermomix is laying down. ‚ÄîMatthew Korfhage",

    "content_text": "Elon Musk asserted last week that before any US federal employee can retire, their paper records have to be processed more than 200 feet underground in an old limestone mine located in rural Pennsylvania, which he said often takes months. ‚ÄúAnd then the speed‚Äîthe limiting factor is the speed‚Äîat which the mine-shaft elevator can move determines how many people can retire from the federal government,‚Äù Musk said, standing next to a seated President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. ‚ÄúAnd the elevator breaks down sometimes, and then nobody can retire‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt that sound crazy?‚Äù\nWhile Musk‚Äôs comment about elevator dependency is overstated‚Äîthe mine has many entrances and exits, as well as a road leading in and out that golf carts and other vehicles can drive on‚Äîhis general point about inefficiencies within the federal retirement process is true. The Office of Personnel Management, which functions as the human resources department of the US government, tells retirees to expect a three- to five-month wait to process their applications. And retirement paperwork for federal employees does route through a storage facility in a repurposed limestone mine in rural Boyers, about 50 miles north of Pittsburgh.\nWhen the system at Boyers was first established decades ago, putting retiree archives and processing files under one roof that was both remote and secure made a lot of sense. But over time, a systematic lack of resources, combined with repeated failed attempts to automate and digitize, created the ‚Äúsinkhole of bureaucracy‚Äù that is the federal retirement hub today.\nSix years ago, the Government Accountability Office reported that the OPM‚Äôs retirement system was still plagued by a ‚Äúcontinuing reliance on paper-based applications and manual processing.‚Äù The agency's average retirement file processing time was about 60 days in 2019, which is only a modest decrease from 1981, when it took 98 days, but the agency processed almost twice as many applications.\nBut David Carmicheal, who recently retired as state archivist of Pennsylvania and has corresponded with staff at the Boyers facility, tells WIRED it‚Äôs a mistake to only view OPM‚Äôs process as ‚Äúwoefully outdated.‚Äù\n‚ÄúMuch of the work that goes on at Boyers, as I understand it, is digital, so the idea of people trundling piles of paper through dark mine shafts is absurd,‚Äù Carmicheal says. ‚ÄúIn fact, these facilities are meant to protect you and me by protecting the records that safeguard our legal rights, our public benefits.‚Äù\nWhen reached for comment, the Government Accountability Office referred WIRED to its most recent publications. The Office of Personnel Management did not respond to a request for comment.\nGoing Underground\nThe Civil Service Commission, the predecessor of the OPM, started mailing retirement files to Boyers in 1960 with the intent to archive them ‚Äúforever.‚Äù The CSC was one of many agencies that took advantage of repurposed mines and caves during the Cold War, seeking enhanced protection for sensitive materials in the event of a nuclear catastrophe.\nThe Boyers mine was operational from 1902 to roughly 1959 under the helm of US Steel. When high operating costs and dwindling demand for limestone caused the business to decline in the 1950s, US Steel employee Larry Yont saw an opportunity to repurpose the site as a storage facility and, with the help of civil engineer and mine superintendent Russell Mitchell, went on to found National Underground Storage. It was later bought by the company Iron Mountain in 1998, which owns and leases the Boyers mine to this day.\nAlong with the Civil Service Commission, other federal agencies, including the National Archives, the Office of Civil Defense (the precursor to the Federal Emergency Management Agency), and the Social Security Administration began storing records in the Boyers facility around the same time. J. G. Franz, then office manager of the Boyers mine, told a newspaper reporter in 1966 that federal agencies have ‚Äúbackup equipment for everything‚Äù stored in a special area of Boyers to protect the records in the event of nuclear fallout.\nFranz told a local newspaper that workers ‚Äúhope we will never have to worry about a nuclear explosion,‚Äù but that if one happened, the mine would be safely sealed off, according to newspaper archives reviewed by WIRED. ‚ÄúThe mine is equipped with a 30-day supply of food and supplies for all of the employees.‚Äù\nAt the time, the staff at Boyers were reportedly able to process about 600 pounds of records each day bussed to the facility straight from Washington, DC. They relied on the recently constructed interstate highway system for timely deliveries. In fact, the federal government built an exit off Pennsylvania‚Äôs Interstate 80 specifically for ‚Äúquick access to the mine in case of an emergency,‚Äù according to an article in the Pittsburgh Press.\nThere are other practical benefits that make old mines a good place to store records. For one, their typically rural and secluded settings create a layer of natural security from other types of threats. Repurposed mines provide ‚Äúexcellent fire protection,‚Äù and immunity from events like ‚Äúflood, theft, civil disorder, aircraft crashes, tornadoes, lightning,‚Äù noted a 1999 Iron Mountain presentation for the National Archives.\nCarmichael tells WIRED that access to the underground facilities he‚Äôs visited tend to be tightly controlled, often through heavily guarded entrances. These facilities also frequently have maze-like designs that would likely discourage or confuse thieves if they somehow got inside.\nSeveral current managers of repurposed limestone mines told WIRED that their caves are naturally between 55 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, optimal temperature for most storage situations. John Smith, director of industrial real estate for the company that manages the limestone storage facility Carefree Industrial Park near Kansas City, Missouri, said that this means utility costs are ‚Äúdramatically lower‚Äù compared to above-ground facilities. His main expenses are associated with ventilation, since caves tend to be very humid.\nIt All Goes Wrong\nShortly before the Civil Service Commission arrived at Boyers, the US federal retirement apparatus was a mess. A 1951 government report found that ‚Äúan adequate record system‚Äù wasn‚Äôt even in place yet and urged Congress to ‚Äúinsist‚Äù one be created. At first, it seemed like the team at Boyers was able to turn things around. The News-Herald reported in 1966 that with just 55 employees, the system at the mine was operating ‚Äúwith the same efficiency and effectiveness as it used to in Washington, DC.‚Äù\nHowever, as the number of retirees continued to climb, things fell into disarray. By the early 1980s, the Office of Personnel Management was being audited to find the root causes of excessive delays in processing retirement claims. In 1981, the Government Accountability Office recommended that OPM ‚Äúdevelop a long-term plan for automating the retirement claims process.‚Äù\nOPM tried to launch an automated system in 1987, only to shut it down in 1996 when it failed an independent review. It began planning a new system, but gave up in 2001 and decided to contract the work out. The contracts weren‚Äôt awarded until 2006. The system they eventually built, RetireEZ, was finally launched in 2008, but it too was promptly shut down due to ‚Äúquality issues.‚Äù\nLittle progress was made until 2013, when OPM launched a new ‚Äústrategic vision‚Äù for a totally ‚Äúpaperless system.‚Äù Around that time, the agency was able to partially digitize the retirement process, allowing retirees to receive 80 percent of their pension quickly. But to get the full value, physical files still had to go through Boyers, according to a 2014 feature story in The Washington Post.\nBy 2019, the Government Accountability Office reported that OPM didn‚Äôt have enough money to finish digitizing. The agency was then piloting what it called the Electronic Retirement Record system, which was supposed to replace hard copies altogether. As part of the improvements, OPM was also trying to fix ‚Äúinconsistent data between electronic and paper records,‚Äù according to the Government Accountability Office. Boyers workers would sometimes have to track down the physical copies of records by navigating through what had become essentially a small city of shelves and files, or type up other files that weren‚Äôt digitized.\nDespite all of these efforts, the OPM still hasn‚Äôt finished digitizing the retirement process. It‚Äôs been a decade since the agency updated its internal guide for processing retirement applications. The Government Accountability Office attributed the slow pace of progress to ‚Äúthe continuing reliance on paper-based applications and manual processing,‚Äù lack of staffing, and OPM frequently receiving incomplete submissions.\nMusk and DOGE have defunded and started to hollow out a slew of government agencies. While the centibillionaire has identified Boyers as a prime example of government inefficiency, he hasn‚Äôt described a clear vision for fixing the retirement system.\nDespite their shortcomings, Carmicheal tells WIRED that it‚Äôs important to remember why government bureaucracies and record-keeping systems were set up in the first place. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just thankful that we have had a long history in this country of governments that care about protecting their citizens,‚Äù Carmichael says, ‚Äúand that includes safeguarding the records that document our rights and the responsibility of governments toward us.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "Over the past couple of decades, a number of US government officials have left their roles for lucrative jobs at tech companies. Plenty of tech executives have also departed to take leadership positions inside federal agencies. But four experts who track the federal workforce tell WIRED they were stunned last week by a development unlike any other they could recall: The Department of Treasury internally announced that Tom Krause had been appointed its fiscal assistant secretary, but that he would simultaneously continue his job as CEO of the company Cloud Software Group.\nKrause is now in charge of both a sensitive government payment system and a company that has millions of dollars‚Äô worth of active contracts with various federal agencies through distribution partners, according to a WIRED review of searchable spending records. The Department of Treasury alone accounts for a dozen ongoing contracts tied to Krause‚Äôs company that are together valued between $7.3 million to $11.8 million. These include licenses for the data visualization tool ibi WebFocus and purchases of systems called Citrix NetScaler that help manage traffic to apps. (Some publicly posted procurement records do not break out contract details, so actual figures may be even higher.)\nCritics have expressed concern about the alleged conflicts of interest posed by Krause‚Äôs decision to keep his role in the private sector. Cloud Software could benefit from extending its federal contracts or securing additional ones, though there is no public evidence that Krause has done anything improper with his dual roles. Existing federal regulations also bar actual and apparent unjust favoritism in contracting. ‚ÄúPublic trust in those safeguards is nonnegotiable,‚Äù says Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog group.\nAs Krause moves forward with two jobs, he could have to potentially navigate not only contracting conflicts, but also dueling crises. ‚ÄúWhat would happen if a Citrix emergency emerges at the same time as Treasury obligations?‚Äù says Jeff Hauser, founder and executive director of the Revolving Door Project, which researches federal appointees. ‚ÄúGenerally, the thicket of restrictions on full-time employees would make a CEO role impossible in an administration which took adherence to ethics laws seriously.‚Äù\nKrause, the Treasury Department, and Cloud Software didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment. Cloud Software investors also didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.\nThe Treasury Department has told Congress that Krause is a ‚Äúspecial government employee‚Äù‚Äîa type of temporary role‚Äîthat is supposed to be held to ‚Äúthe same ethical standards of privacy, confidentiality, conflicts of interest assessment, and professionalism of other government employees.‚Äù In a foreword to a code of conduct policy posted on Cloud Software‚Äôs website, Krause states, ‚ÄúCloud Software Group is committed to ensuring that its business is conducted ethically, in compliance with the law, and according to its values of integrity, honesty and respect.‚Äù\nKrause is among a group of several dozen veteran tech executives, mid-level tech operations managers, and fresh-out-of-school software coders who have been recently installed across a series of federal agencies under the auspices of the self-styled Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE‚Äôs authority is being challenged by some Democratic state attorneys general. In the meantime, its representatives have been carrying out an order from President Donald Trump to cut costs and modernize technology across the government.\nThere is some precedent for corporate executives to simultaneously work in the US government. When the US was at war in the early 1900s, the federal government recruited business leaders to fill key posts. They retained their private sector jobs and wages; the government pitched in a $1 annual salary to the executives who became known as ‚Äúdollar-a-year men.‚Äù Congress later raised concerns that some of them had engaged in self-dealing.\nSince then, other executives have continued to retain their jobs as they serve on government boards and commissions, typically in a part-time capacity. But maintaining a day-to-day operational role in both the federal government and at a corporation is now virtually unheard of, says David E. Lewis, a political scientist who wrote a book on appointed government bureaucrats. ‚ÄúMost persons in regular executive positions divest themselves of private interests before government service,‚Äù he says.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at peard33.24.\nTrump, according to his company, has handed management of his businesses, including hotels and golf courses, to his children for the duration of his presidency (though he reportedly still takes meetings that have raised questions among ethics experts). Musk, who is CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and has oversight of four other companies, including X and Neuralink, has been a vocal figure in DOGE‚Äôs operations, but the White House has said he‚Äôs not actually in charge‚Äîwithout specifying who is leading the project. Some of the other individuals associated with DOGE are otherwise unemployed, have taken leave, or maintain dual roles but at lower levels than chief executive.\nKrause is the only Trump administration official identified so far as being a CEO and a day-to-day decisionmaker inside one particular agency. After years of working as an executive at chip companies, Krause joined Florida-based Cloud Software Group in 2022. The company was created that year as part of a private-equity-backed acquisition of Citrix, followed by a merger with Tibco, another tech company. At the time, Citrix was saddled with an extensive amount of debt and generating essentially stagnant revenues, and while Tibco had not recently publicly disclosed its finances, analysts had considered the company‚Äôs outlook to be ‚Äúnegative.‚Äù\nThe US government, including state and local agencies, is expected to spend $287 billion on technology this year, or about 14 percent of overall US tech spending, according to Forrester, a research and advisory company. Whether DOGE‚Äôs efforts to boost the quality and efficiency of federal IT systems will lead that spending to increase or decrease isn‚Äôt clear. So far, DOGE has both tried to purchase emerging technologies and moved to cancel some existing contracts. But Krause‚Äôs inside access could potentially provide an advantage to Cloud Software at a pivotal moment for the company.\nOver the past couple of years, Cloud Software has laid off thousands of people and faced accusations that it potentially became lax with cybersecurity. Cloud Software‚Äôs most well-known offering, Citrix, enables groups of workers to access data and run apps that are located on a remote machine. But increasing adoption of tools that can operate on any device has chipped away at some of Citrix‚Äôs dominance, according to Will McKeon-White, senior analyst for infrastructure and operations at Forrester. There are other options now, he says, including from Microsoft and smaller companies such as Island.\nCloud Software‚Äôs Tibco program, which helps workers automate tasks such as adding a new user to multiple internal databases, is often mentioned in the wrong sort of conversations these days, according to David Mooter, a Forrester principal analyst. ‚ÄúThey tend to come up more when somebody wants to abandon them,‚Äù he says.\nThat said, some Cloud Software services are more affordable than alternatives for governments, and they also are better suited for the older infrastructure used by some agencies. Last year appears to have been one of Citrix‚Äôs best in a long time financially, says Shannon Kalvar, a research director for enterprise systems management and other areas at IDC. One reason for the upswing is that Citrix has put more emphasis on catering to the feature demands of its largest customers, including governments.",

    "content_text": "When the so-called Department of Government Efficiency recently fired dozens of people from the US Digital Service‚Äîthe agency DOGE subsumed last month‚Äîit may not have realized the extent of the collateral damage.\nThe USDS doesn't operate in a vacuum; part of its longtime mandate is to consult with federal agencies to help improve their digital platforms and websites. So when DOGE terminated Jonathan Kamens in its agency purge, it may not have fully grasped that it was firing the security lead for the Department of Veterans Affairs website‚Äîthe digital hub that connects veterans with their benefits and hosts sensitive personal data, including medical records.\nInterviews with multiple current and former VA sources, along with veterans who now work in private-sector cybersecurity, indicate that Kamens‚Äô firing could have disastrous privacy consequences for millions of US veterans.\n‚ÄúI believe that his abrupt firing puts the security of veterans services at risk,‚Äù one source with knowledge of VA systems, who was granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, told WIRED about Kamens. ‚ÄúEliminating the person responsible for the security of veteran information on VA.gov erodes the quality of the service for the veteran. It‚Äôs reckless.‚Äù\nVA.gov is what Kamens calls ‚Äúthe front door‚Äù for all VA benefits. The site served more than 20 million registered users in the past 12 months, resulting in more than 53 million transactions. Veterans go there to access, among other things, financial, educational, health care, and death benefits. In other words, VA digital services are not only central to the lives of many veterans and their families but also a repository of deeply private information about their lives.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inevitable that the cybersecurity practice within VA.gov is going to suffer and that they are going to fall behind on what they are required to do in order to keep cybersecurity on VA.gov where it needs to be,‚Äù Kamens says. ‚ÄúAnd the result of that is it‚Äôs going to get worse, and eventually it will get bad enough that there will be an incident.‚Äù\nKamens was not the only person working on VA digital security and was far from the only person there who cares about safeguarding veterans' personal data. But he served a vital role in a large and important government apparatus that is notoriously strapped for resources. In particular, Kamens says, he was the only staffer working full-time on VA.gov cybersecurity and, therefore, the point person for overseeing protective upgrades and services from third-party security vendors.\n‚ÄúThis is sensitive data that in the wrong hands can do harm to people,‚Äù Kamens says. ‚ÄúThere was always too much work to do and not enough people to do it, and now all of a sudden I‚Äôm gone. DOGE is all about efficiency, and that is not going to make VA more efficient.‚Äù\nThe VA did not comment in response to WIRED's questions about changes in the cybersecurity staffing for VA.gov. In addition to cuts at USDS, more than 1,000 workers were fired from the VA itself last week. ‚ÄúPresident Trump's looking for efficiencies so that we can do our job better,\" said secretary of veterans affairs Doug Collins in a video statement on Thursday. ‚ÄúWhen you're doing things, you're making moves, you're making good moves, motion causes friction.‚Äù\nThe dozens of USDS cuts last week hit teams like product management, design, and procurement. Kamens and other sources told WIRED that he is the only person from the USDS engineering team who was fired. He and others speculate that he was targeted because he had been publicly critical of DOGE in the weeks before the USDS cuts. DOGE did not return a request for comment about his removal.\nWhile all large IT systems need to be protected from hacking threats, Kamens says that the most urgent projects he was working on at the VA involved containing veterans' sensitive personal data so it could only be stored in the most guarded parts of the system and deploying stronger controls to limit who could access what information. Both understanding how data flows through a system and limiting access to reduce risk from network intrusion and insider threats have emerged as key security priorities for any organization.\n‚ÄúMy biggest concern that I was trying to address in my time at the VA related to personal health data and personal information, PHI and PII, ending up in places they weren‚Äôt supposed to be,‚Äù Kamens says. ‚ÄúAnd, in my opinion, our access control, while it was OK, was not as strong as it should have been, meaning I don‚Äôt think we had enough granularity over controlling who had access to what data.\" He adds that projects he was spearheading to address these concerns are now at high risk of stalling out.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at +1 (347) 722-1347.\nThe impacts of the cuts at VA, as well as the USDS cuts that will also affect the veterans' agency, are still coming into view. But in addition to potentially hampering initiatives to improve digital security, the reductions may affect the efficacy and reliability of the digital protections that are currently in place.\nSenator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington and the vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, hosted a virtual press conference on Wednesday with former federal workers from her state who were recently terminated. One, Raphael Garcia, is a disabled Army veteran who had been working as a management analyst for the VA.\n‚ÄúI coordinated IT system access so that every team member had the proper tools,‚Äù Garcia said during the event. ‚ÄúI managed critical compliance and operational controls while maintaining constant communication with stakeholders nationwide.\" He added that while his termination is a personal hardship, it is also a ‚Äústark reminder that our federal government is dismantling its central support system for veterans and vulnerable communities.‚Äù\nFor his part, Kamens, who spent his career prior to USDS in the private sector, says that he came to love government work, and it will be difficult to find another job as rewarding.\n‚ÄúThere were these interviews we all had to do with the DOGE people the day after the inauguration,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn mine, one of them asked me to describe what I was doing at VA and then said something like, ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre doing all that work, why aren‚Äôt you working in the private sector where you could be making twice as much money?‚Äô And I said, ‚ÄòBecause I don‚Äôt care about the money.

Bekker, a 62-year-old medical professor from the University of Cape Town, had helped identify a drug that could do just that.\nBut now, thanks to the Trump administration‚Äôs executive orders, it‚Äôs unclear when‚Äîor possibly even ever‚Äîthis breakthrough medicine will see the light of day.\nAt the AIDS 2024 conference held in Munich last July, Bekker had triumphantly unveiled the results of a momentous clinical trial she had led, called PURPOSE 1. It showed that lenacapavir, an antiretroviral developed by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, could prevent sexual transmission of HIV with 100 percent efficacy by disrupting the function of the virus‚Äôs capsid protein, which allows it to replicate.\nEven more remarkably, compared with existing daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pills, which do a similar job, injections are only required every six months. While not strictly a vaccine, lenacapavir promises to be the next best thing. It was named as 2024‚Äôs ‚ÄúBreakthrough of the Year‚Äù by the prestigious journal Science, and Gilead promptly committed to manufacturing 10 million doses by 2026, enough to treat 2.5 million people, ahead of anticipated regulatory approval later this year.\nA collaborative effort between the medicines-financing initiative The Global Fund and PEPFAR, the US government‚Äôs global HIV/AIDS program, had pledged to procure 2 million of those doses over the course of three years, which would be directed toward countries with the highest incidence of HIV, most notably in sub-Saharan Africa. But with President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision to freeze all foreign aid funding, this plan has been left in tatters.\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs despondency and a sense of tragedy,‚Äù says Bekker. ‚ÄúBecause just as we‚Äôve had the breakthrough, we also see the taps turning off of resources. We had a laid-out map where the product would be supplied via PEPFAR and The Global Fund while we wait for generics [cheaper off-label versions of lenacapavir] to come online, which will take 18 months to two years. And at this moment, that plan is falling through in front of our eyes.‚Äù\nWhile a temporary 90-day waiver has been issued for PEPFAR funding, this has only reinstated funding for life-saving antiretroviral treatments for HIV-positive individuals. Existing forms of PrEP are covered, but only for pregnant or breastfeeding women. There have been no indications that the planned purchase of lenacapavir will be fulfilled.\nAccording to Kenneth Ngure, an HIV-prevention expert in Kenya and president-elect of the International AIDS Society, the loss of PEPFAR funding for prevention represents a major setback in the world‚Äôs ability to control HIV. ‚ÄúEven if The Global Fund partners with others, they will probably not be able to reach the number of doses they had promised,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe have this potential game-changer, which could accelerate the end of HIV as a public health threat, and yet it looks like access will be highly compromised.‚Äù\nFor Ngure and others, there is a sense of history repeating itself. The major limitation of PrEP is that adherence is notoriously poor, with studies showing that target groups often struggle to access or forget to take daily pills and feel stigmatized doing so. ‚ÄúWe know that particularly for young people, taking a daily oral PrEP pill is challenging,‚Äù says Bekker. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve tried all sorts of things, like sending text messages. S√£o Paulo is even giving PrEP in a dispensing machine. But it‚Äôs sometimes very difficult to take something daily when you‚Äôre not sick and you‚Äôre doing it for prevention.‚Äù\nLonger-acting injectables have long been viewed as a better way forward, and in 2021, the HIV field was galvanized by promising trial results for cabotegravir, a form of injectable PrEP that only needed to be administered every two months, with a trial demonstrating that people receiving this drug had 90 percent less risk of contracting HIV compared with oral pills. Yet access has been the major hurdle.\nLast month a new study revealed that while regulators in 53 countries have approved cabotegravir, rollout has been painfully slow. Generic versions of the jab are not expected to become available until 2027. In Africa and Asia, where cabotegravir is most needed, the only access so far has been through so-called Phase 4 or implementation science studies, which attempt to understand more about the real-world challenges of offering a new drug by dispensing it to a few thousand people.\nAnd also as a consequence of orders coming out of the White House, a number of these Phase 4 studies have abruptly ceased. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre very concentrated in East and Southern Central Africa,‚Äù says Bekker. ‚ÄúSome of them were PEPFAR supported, and with the stop-work order, these studies have ground to a halt.‚Äù\nThe frustration for researchers like Bekker is that while long-acting injectables are extremely effective at blocking HIV transmission, to end the epidemic, their rollout needs to be as rapid and as wide-reaching as possible. She points out that to prevent over a million new infections each year, these jabs need to be targeted at HIV hotspots and administered on a scale of millions‚Äîexactly as the plan with lenacapavir was proposing.\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen with both cabotegravir and oral PrEP that if you get a new tool, but roll it out gently, that will not impact the epidemic,‚Äù says Ngure. ‚ÄúThe number of new infections still outpaces the impact of the tool. You need something which is potent and to roll it out fast.‚Äù\nWith lenacapavir, things were supposed to be different. Gilead has partnered with six generic drugmakers, which have been licensed to produce enough of an off-label supply of lenacapavir to cover 120 countries. Estimates have suggested that if the global demand exceeded more than 20 million doses, the manufacturing costs could fall to just $35-40 per person per year. However, Bekker says that PEPFAR was expected to be a significant buyer, and without its financial clout the commercial viability of manufacturing generic lenacapavir at vast scales is in doubt.\n‚ÄúIt requires a nice healthy demand to ensure that for each of the generic companies, it‚Äôs going to be worth their while,‚Äù says Bekker. ‚ÄúWe are all hoping that governments [across sub-Saharan Africa] are writing the generic product into their budgets for the future, but the reality is that in the interim, we were relying on donor funding. Even my country, South Africa, which has a good GDP and funds 80 percent of its HIV response, is already purchasing antiretrovirals for 6 million individuals annually. I would imagine it will take them some years to be able to mobilize the money for lenacapavir as well.‚Äù\nWith PEPFAR seemingly now focused primarily on the treatment of existing patients, at the expense of prevention, clinicians like Nomathemba Chandiwana, a physician-scientist at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation in South Africa, are concerned that the infection rate will begin to rise rather than fall, something which will have a marked public health impact across the African continent and beyond.\nSpeaking at last week‚Äôs NCD Alliance Forum in Kigali, Chandiwana explained that the consequences of new infections are not solely related to HIV itself. Research is increasingly showing that people living with long-term HIV infections, even those controlled by antiretroviral treatment, are at a greater risk of developing metabolic conditions such as hypertension, obesity and type 2 diabetes, a disease burden which is already on the rise in sub-Saharan Africa. ‚ÄúHIV itself disrupts your metabolism, as do many of the antiretrovirals,‚Äù says Chandiwana. ‚ÄúWe see the same chronic diseases in people living with HIV as we do in the general population, but at an earlier age and in an accelerated fashion.‚Äù\nBecause of this, there is also a need for a new generation of HIV treatments, and one concept being explored was to use lenacapavir as a foundation of future combination therapies for those already with the virus. As well as potentially alleviating some of the metabolic side effects, it was hoped that this could lead to treatment protocols that did not require HIV-infected individuals to take daily medication.\n‚ÄúVarious ideas have been mooted,‚Äù says Bekker. ‚ÄúCould you combine bimonthly cabotegravir with a six-monthly lenacapavir injection [as a form of viral suppression], so you‚Äôd only come in six times a year for treatment, and it would all be injectable? There‚Äôs a weekly antiretroviral pill in the works, and could you combine that with a six-monthly injectable? This could be very liberating for people, as they tell us all the time how stigmatizing it is to need to take daily medication.‚Äù\nYet many of these studies are now in doubt, as Bekker says they were expected to be funded by US resources. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just PEPFAR; we‚Äôre also worried about restrictions being placed on other sorts of research funding, such as the National Institutes of Health,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just going to get harder to innovate and move progress forward.‚Äù\nAccording to Ngure, there is still hope that other donors may emerge who can support The Global Fund in procuring lenacapavir, while Bekker says she is exploring new options for funding HIV prevention and research through European agencies, and possibly donor funding from sources in Scandinavia, Japan, and Australia. At the same time, she believes that the events of the past month have illustrated that African countries need to become capable of funding more preventative efforts themselves.\n‚ÄúSomehow Africa needs to step up and contribute to the fight,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs the big question. How much we can also contribute on this continent through countries which haven‚Äôt necessarily been able to cover a big amount of research and development but in the future need to.‚Äù\nAt the same time, she is afraid that without the same resources coming from the US, the unique opportunity provided by lenacapavir could be lost.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredible that this has happened just as we‚Äôve had the breakthrough,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI think this is going to set us back many years and ultimately cost a lot more in public health spending. Because ultimately, if we can bring this epidemic under control more quickly, it‚Äôs going to save the planet more money in the long run, and save lives too.‚Äù",

Learn more.\nIn a surprising twist, Apple has expanded the iPhone 16 range months after launch with the new iPhone 16e. Unlike the iPhone SE it replaced, the iPhone 16e is a part of the ‚ÄúiPhone 16 family,‚Äù according to Tim Cook. That means you have a staggering five different iPhone 16 models to choose from: iPhone 16e, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max, and they range from $599 unlocked to $1,199.\nIf you're planning to upgrade and aren't sure which model is right for you, don't worry, I'm here to help. I‚Äôll break down the differences and similarities of each model in this guide so you can make a more informed choice about your next iPhone.\nUpdated February 2025: We've added details about the iPhone 16e and updated the carrier deals.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that‚Äôs too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nShould You Upgrade?\nAh, the age-old question. Should you get the new iPhone? Our philosophy here at WIRED is that you should only upgrade if you need to. Is your current phone operating perfectly fine? If the experience is OK for the most part but maybe your battery life has deteriorated, try doing a battery swap first‚ÄîApple offers a battery replacement program for a modest fee‚Äîand this could breathe new life into your device. There are also more ways to repair an iPhone than ever before.\nBut if your current phone is frustrating to use, upgrade! Like the iPhone 15 range, the entire iPhone 16 lineup has a USB-C port. These devices can also take advantage of Apple Intelligence (alongside the iPhone 15 Pro)‚Äîif that's something you care about.\nIf you've decided to do it, read our guide on how to sell your iPhone. Make sure you back up your iPhone first, and factory-reset it to erase your data from the device. We also have tips on how to set up your new iPhone to get the most out of your new handset.\nWhich iPhone 16 Model Is Right for You?\nThe iPhone 16 range includes the iPhone 16e, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical except for screen size and battery life. The same is true for both Pro models. Between those two pairs, the decision comes down to whether you want a small or big phone.\nHow does the iPhone 16e compare? It's the same size as the iPhone 16, but since it's the cheapest, Apple has cut a few features to hit that $599 price. The design is notably different‚Äîthere's no color-infused glass back here. It's powered by the A18 chip, but it lacks one GPU core for a total of four as opposed to the five-core GPU on the standard iPhone 16. That means a slight hit to graphics performance, impacting games and other demanding tasks. Unlike the rest of the range, this iPhone does not have the Dynamic Island floating selfie camera system but instead uses the notch camera design like on the original iPhone X.\nThe bigger iPhones tend to have the best battery life. The iPhone 16 Pro Max and iPhone 16 Plus handily gave me hours of extra run time over their smaller siblings. You can take the bigger phones into the morning of a second day on a single charge, even with heavy use. If battery life is your top priority, choose between the largest models.\nHowever, the iPhone 16e beats the iPhone 16 in battery run time despite being the same size. This is because it's the first time Apple is using its own modem‚Äîthe C1 chip‚Äîwhich the company claims is more efficient, thereby saving battery life. Apple says the iPhone 16e can last up to 21 hours of streamed video playback, whereas the iPhone 16 hit 18 hours. In my tests, the iPhone 16e easily outlasted the iPhone 16‚ÄîI hit 9 hours of screen-on time and had 15 percent left by bedtime on one particularly intensive day. That's fantastic.\nAll of these iPhones have the Action button, which replaces the Mute switch and is now configurable, so you can replicate the Mute switch functionality or execute another action, like turning on a flashlight or triggering a shortcut. All of them except for the iPhone 16e sport the new Camera Control button. You can use it to open the camera and take a photo, but a light press shows different camera modes, and you can slide your finger left or right across the button's surface to cycle through various modes, zoom levels, and more.\nYou can use this button to trigger Visual Intelligence, Apple's version of Google Lens‚Äîpoint your iPhone at something in the real world to get more information about it. iPhone 16e users can still access this feature through the Action Button or Control Center, and that capability will also be rolling out to the iPhone 15 Pro in the coming weeks.\nEvery iPhone 16 model can now take advantage of a cool video feature called Audio Mix. This lets you change how your videos sound when you're editing them by choosing a sound profile. These include In-Frame, which focuses the audio on whoever is in the frame; Studio, which makes it sound like you were in a studio, cutting all background noise; and Cinematic, which makes sure whoever is at the center of the frame comes in clear, with a little bit of ambient noise mixed in. This feature performs slightly better on the iPhone 16 Pro models, since they have upgraded microphones.\nThe redesigned Photographic Styles are also available in the entire range except the iPhone 16e. These are almost like filters but better‚Äîinstead of changing the look of the whole image, these Styles can maintain skin tones so they don't look weird and can adjust other parts of the photo like shadows and highlights. They're among the standout features, so play around with them! Apple is also giving you more control over how your skin tone looks, instead of going for more of a one-size-fits-all approach like Google does with its Pixel phones.\nApple Intelligence is the headline feature, and the only way to try out the new artificial intelligence capabilities is to use a phone that supports it: the iPhone 16 range, the iPhone 15 Pro, or the iPhone 15 Pro Max. I covered these features in broader detail in our iOS 18 guide and evaluated many of the features here. To summarize, it includes a revamped Siri experience, real-time audio transcription in Voice Notes and Notes (even call recording), and writing assistance features like proofreading and changing the tone of your messages. You can create custom emojis through Genmoji, generate images via Image Playground, and tap into ChatGPT via Siri.\nThe basics are otherwise the same across the board. They sport an IP68 water-resistance rating and have OLED screens that can hit a peak brightness of 2,000 nits in outdoor sunny conditions, though the iPhone 16e is restricted to 1,200 nits. Apple's new twice-as-strong Ceramic Shield glass on the front is available on all of them except the iPhone 16e, which uses an older version of Ceramic Shield (glass is still glass, so get a case).\nOnce again, all but the iPhone 16e feature MagSafe wireless charging, which supports the Qi2 standard for wider compatibility with accessories; Apple is selling a new MagSafe Wireless Charger that can juice up these phones even faster, and it finally has a longer cable. The iPhone 16e has basic Qi wireless charging, which is slower and less energy-efficient, but since there are no built-in magnets, you cannot enjoy the wealth of MagSafe accessories unless you use a MagSafe case.\n|Specs:\n|iPhone 16e\n|iPhone 16\n|iPhone 16 Plus\n|iPhone 16 Pro\n|iPhone 16 Pro Max\n|Display:\n|6.1 inches, 60 Hz, OLED, 1,200 nits (HDR)\n|6.1 inch, 60 Hz, OLED, 2,000 nits\n|6.7 inch, 60 Hz, OLED, 2,000 nits\n|6.3 inch, 120 Hz (ProMotion), OLED, 2,000 nits, always-on display\n|6.9 inch, 120 Hz (ProMotion), OLED, 2,000 nits, always-on display\n|Processor:\n|A18 (4-core GPU)\n|A18 (5-core GPU)\n|A18 (5-core GPU)\n|A18 Pro (6-core GPU)\n|A18 Pro (6-core GPU)\n|Storage:\n|128, 256, 512 GB options\n|128, 256, 512 GB options\n|128, 256, 512 GB options\n|128, 256, 512 GB, and 1 TB options\n|256, 512 GB, and 1 TB options\n|Cameras:\n|48-MP main camera, 12-MP front camera\n|48-MP main camera, 12-MP ultrawide with Macro, 12-MP front camera\n|48-MP main camera, 12-MP ultrawide with Macro, 12-MP front camera\n|48-MP Fusion camera, 48-MP ultrawide with Macro, 12-MP telephoto with 5X zoom, 12-MP front camera\n|48-MP Fusion camera, 48-MP ultrawide with Macro, 12-MP telephoto with 5X zoom, 12-MP front camera\n|USB-C speeds:\n|USB 2, up to 480 Mb/s\n|USB 2, up to 480 Mb/s\n|USB 2, up to 480 Mb/s\n|USB 3, up to 10 Gb/s\n|USB 3, up to 10 Gb/s\n|Colors:\n|Black and White\n|Pink, Teal, Ultramarine, White, and Black\n|Pink, Teal, Ultramarine, White, and Black\n|Black, White, Natural, Desert\n|Black, White, Natural, Desert\n|Material:\n|Aluminum\n|Aluminum\n|Aluminum\n|Titanium\n|Titanium\n|Extras:\n|Qi wireless charging, Face ID, Apple Intelligence, IP68, Wi-Fi 6\n|Qi2/MagSafe wireless charging, Face ID, Dynamic Island, Ultra Wideband (2nd Gen), IP68, Wi-Fi 7\n|Qi2/MagSafe wireless charging, Face ID, Dynamic Island, Ultra Wideband (2nd Gen), IP68, Wi-Fi 7\n|Qi2/MagSafe wireless charging, Face ID, Dynamic Island, Ultra Wideband (2nd Gen), IP68, Wi-Fi 7\n|Qi2/MagSafe wireless charging, Face ID, Dynamic Island, Ultra Wideband (2nd Gen), IP68, Wi-Fi 7\n|Price:\n|$599\n|$929\n|$999\n|$1,199\nHere's a quick breakdown of how they differ:\n- iPhone 16e ($599): The 6.1-inch iPhone 16e (7/10, WIRED Review) omits several features from the iPhone 16. It doesn't have the ultrawide camera, MagSafe, Camera Control, or Dynamic Island, and cannot capture spatial photos and videos. It has the older version of Photographic Styles and portrait photos‚Äîit won't automatically capture depth information unless you specifically use the Portrait mode, unlike the iPhone 16, which enables this when it detects a person or pet. In video recordings, there is no Cinematic mode or Action mode. This iPhone also doesn't have the ultra-wideband chip, so you won't be able to precisely see where in the vicinity your AirTags are, just a general area.\n- iPhone 16 ($829): The 6.1-inch iPhone 16 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by the A18 processor, which is 30 percent faster than the iPhone 15 and 60 percent faster than the iPhone 12. The USB-C port supports USB 2 data speeds (up to 480 Mbps), but that might not be an issue if you rarely transfer files via a cable. Apple has upgraded the 12-megapixel ultrawide camera to capture more detail, and since it has autofocus, you can use it as a macro camera to take pictures of subjects up close.\n- iPhone 16 Plus ($929): The iPhone 16 Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is identical to the iPhone 16 but has a larger 6.7-inch screen. The larger size also means it has a beefier battery, and it can last more than a day on a single charge. Both of these iPhones more closely match the Pro devices than ever, only missing out on a few things you might care about like a 120-Hz screen or the 5X optical zoom camera. Yes, there are other things the Pro devices can do, but many of them are fancy camera features you're unlikely to use.\n- iPhone 16 Pro ($999): The 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) steps things up in a few ways. First, the screen is larger than its predecessor, with slimmer bezels around the screen. The build quality is titanium, which is more durable than the aluminum in the iPhone 16 models. The display also supports ProMotion, which means the screen can refresh 120 times per second, making it more responsive and smoother (this is the standard in most smartphones). The Pro iPhones are still the only ones that support the always-on display. They also feature the A18 Pro chipset, which has an extra graphics core for slightly better gaming performance, and the CPU cores in this chipset also have larger cache sizes, meaning this processor is a bit faster overall than even the A18 in the iPhone 16.\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max ($1,199): Like the Plus, the Max (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is identical to the smaller iPhone 16 Pro, except it has a larger 6.9-inch screen and Apple claims it has the best battery life of the bunch. (Battery life is really great, but I surprisingly got better results with the iPhone 16 Plus.) The iPhone Pro models differentiate in the cameras. The 48-megapixel Fusion camera has a twice-as-fast sensor read-out time, so you can capture subjects in motion better than ever, and the new 48-megapixel ultrawide camera can dish out more detail in low light. The Pro models can shoot at 4K and 120 frames per second for better slow-motion footage, support the second-gen of Apple's sensor-shift stabilization technology for smoother footage and sharper images, and can capture Night mode portrait photos. This largely applies to creators, but they're also the only phones in the lineup that can capture ProRes video.\nJust because there are new iPhones doesn't mean you have to buy one of these models. Apple is still selling the iPhone 15 for $699 and the iPhone 15 Plus for $799, and there are some potential reasons to buy them over the iPhone 16e. But I strongly suggest you look at websites that sell used phones, such as Swappa, Gazelle, or Backmarket. You can probably snag a relatively recent model at a lower price and in good condition.\nHow to Get the iPhone 16 Unlocked\nI recommend you buy your iPhone 16 unlocked. This lets you easily switch carriers‚Äîwhen you buy from a carrier like AT&T, the device is locked to that network, and the unlocking process can be a hassle. Apple says the iPhones available at its store are unlocked, but there are two exceptions. If you buy an iPhone on an AT&T installment plan directly from Apple, it will stay locked for the duration of the installment plan. And if you buy an iPhone through Boost Mobile's financing, it will be locked to Boost for the first 60 days after activation.\nKeep in mind that there are no more physical SIM card slots in iPhones. The company pivoted to eSIM technology a few years ago, so you can transfer your eSIM between iPhones. You will likely need to contact your carrier if you are going from Android to iPhone (or vice versa).\nDon't forget to take advantage of Apple's promotions: You get three free months of Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, Apple TV+, and Apple Arcade. It'll auto-bill you after the trial, so set a reminder to cancel if you don't want to continue subscribing to these services.\nIf you buy the carrier version, you‚Äôll automatically get a $30 discount off the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, bringing the prices down to $799 and $899.\nDeals on Network-Locked iPhone 16s\nHere are a few promotions from carriers and retailers carrying the iPhone 16 range. These are network-locked. Many of these ‚Äúdeals‚Äù come in the form of monthly bill credits on your phone plan‚Äîif it says ‚Äú$800‚Äù off an iPhone when you open a new line, you'll see your monthly bill lowered over several months.\n- T-Mobile says new and existing T-Mobile customers can get up to $1,000 off an iPhone 16e, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max when trading in an eligible device on a Go5G Next plan. If you have the Go5G Plus plan, you can get up to $830 off. The savings come in the form of bill credits spread over 24 months. T-Mobile also has a new Savings Calculator that shows the price difference of the company's plans compared to AT&T and Verizon. For the iPhone 16e, you can get $630 off in bill credits when you switch to T-Mobile (on most plans).\n- Best Buy is selling the iPhone 16e, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max locked to either AT&T or Verizon.\n- AT&T says new and existing customers with a qualifying unlimited plan can get an iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro for free with an eligible trade-in, up to $830 off an iPhone 16 Plus with an eligible trade-in, or up to $1,000 off an iPhone 16 Pro Max. For the iPhone 16e, you can snag it for $6 per month if you buy it on an installment plan with any unlimited plan, no trade-in required.

The savings come in the form of bill credits. If you get the Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Welcome plans, you can get up to $830 or $415 off with an eligible trade-in, respectively. New and current customers can also snag the iPhone 16e for $5 a month for 36 months with a new line on myPlan.\n- Boost Mobile is offering one year of its wireless service for free when you purchase an iPhone 16 at full price on the $25 per month unlimited plan (for new and existing customers). There's no trade-in or new line requirement. Alternatively, you can get $1,000 off the iPhone 16 lineup if you get Boost's $65 per month Infinite Access plan (which also gets you an upgrade to the latest iPhone every year). No trade-in is required. If you shop directly at Apple and choose Boost at checkout, you can combine this latter offer and get up to $1,650 spread out over bill credits.

The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are identical except for screen size and battery life. The same is true for both Pro models. Between those two pairs, the decision comes down to whether you want a small or big phone.</p><p class=\"paywall\">How does the iPhone 16e compare? It's the same size as the iPhone 16, but since it's the cheapest, Apple has cut a few features to hit that $599 price. The design is notably different‚Äîthere's no color-infused glass back here. It's powered by the A18 chip, but it lacks one GPU core for a total of four as opposed to the five-core GPU on the standard iPhone 16. That means a slight hit to graphics performance, impacting games and other demanding tasks. Unlike the rest of the range, this iPhone does not have the Dynamic Island floating selfie camera system but instead uses the notch camera design like on the original <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/11/review-iphone-x/\">iPhone X</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nCrossplay games are ones you can play online with people on consoles or platforms different than yours. They're increasingly common, but the landscape remains fractured, and the options can be confusing. Some games are available in only a couple of places, and it's often unclear why some platforms are supported for crossplay and others aren't. Here, we've rounded up the best games that work on the most gaming destinations possible, so you can play with friends and family around the world.\nLooking for advice on gaming gear? Check out our many other product guides, including the Best Gaming Headsets, Best Gamepads, Best Gaming Mice, and Best Keyboards.\nUpdated February 2025: We added The Finals, which recently got crossplay support, and Marvel Rivals, added information about Smite 2, and removed MultiVersus, as its servers will be shutting down soon.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nMarvel Rivals (Free)\nIf there was going to be another entry in the increasingly crowded hero shooter space, it makes sense that at least one of them would be set in the hero-crowded Marvel universe. Marvel Rivals has been compared to Overwatch 2, though it stands on its own with a third-person perspective, and less emphasis on precision aiming.\nMy favorite aspect of Marvel Rivals is how different and unique each hero feels. Where a lot of class-based shooters have similar movement and basic combat tech between each hero, each character here is drastically different. Spider-Man can swing across the map at high speed, webbing opposing heroes and then departing without taking damage, where Bruce Banner builds up energy to become The Hulk and smash through the enemy team's line.\nThere's already rich support and a constant wave of new heroes hitting the game, and I'm looking forward to continuing to play and see what comes next.\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.\nFortnite (Free)\nThe gold standard for crossplay might be one of the most obvious, but it's worth calling out up top. Fortnite lets players from across Windows, Xbox One and Series S/X, PlayStation 4 and 5, Nintendo Switch, and Android all play with their friends, no matter which platform they're on, as long as they're friends via their Epic account. Due to some complicated legal issues, you can play on Mac or iOS if you've already downloaded the app, but only new players in the EU can join on iOS for now. The system sorts pools of players into a complexity hierarchy and defaults to the highest tier‚Äîso all your PC friends can't queue for a game with mobile players and destroy them, for example‚Äîbut if you want to bring your friend on Android into a game on PlayStation, you can.\nFortnite developer Epic also owns and operates the Unreal Engine and a huge library of developer tools, including the Epic Online Services platform. These tools let developers add similar crossplay functionality to their own games. We mention it here because you'll see it pop up again. If you want to play games across gaming consoles or devices, you might end up with an Epic account eventually.\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC, and Android.\nThe Finals (Free)\nAction-packed and fast-paced, The Finals has a high-octane combination of features you won't find in most shooters. Teams of three dash across buildings, fly down ziplines, and crash through windows as they fight to extract crates of cash and claim victory. Almost all of the buildings and structures in each map can be destroyed, adding an element of chaos as your cover disappears under heavy fire, but also allowing for fun strategies, like blowing up the floor beneath your enemy to send them plummeting to the ground.\nWith its fun attitude, excellent graphical fidelity, and tons of character customization, I find myself coming back to The Finals regularly to take a few swings with my sledgehammer. This explosive shooter also supports crossplay between PC, PS5, and Xbox Series S/X, and it's free, so it's a great option for a few friends who want to jump into some quick action.\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.\nMinecraft ($20+)\nMicrosoft subsidiary Mojang's Minecraft is an odd paradox of crossplay. Players can join the same servers even as they play on different platforms, but they have to be using the same version. If you've been playing Minecraft since it came out, you may still be on the Java Edition, which can be played across Windows, Mac, and Linux devices.\nHowever, the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition‚Äîor just Minecraft, since 2017‚Äîworks across Windows, iOS and Android, Xbox One and Series X/S, PlayStation 4 and 5, Nintendo Switch, and even VR systems like Windows Mixed Reality and PlayStation VR. There's a notable absence there, though: Bedrock Edition doesn't work on most Macs. Mac players will have to use the Java Edition to play with their friends, and even then only with other computer players. It's a weird hurdle to get over if you're a Mac user, but there are plenty of crossplay options if you own other devices.\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC, Mac, Android, iOS.\nHelldivers 2 ($40+)\nOne of the biggest breakout hits of 2024, Helldivers 2 is a cooperative third-person shooter with a strong Starship Troopers vibe. Teams of up to four players work together to lay waste to procedurally generated bug-infested worlds. Your team can use a variety of high-octane weapons including rocket launchers, walking mechs, and orbital strikes. It's only available for PC and the PS5, but crossplay is supported across both platforms.\nAvailable on PlayStation and PC.\nDiablo IV ($70+)\nThe latest dungeon crawler from Blizzard was in the pipeline for years, and it finally arrived last year. WIRED staff writer Boone Ashworth called it a mind-melting bloodbath in his review. In this game, up to four players can team up to battle waves of enemies and take on bosses that are tougher than any one player could handle alone.\nLike some other Blizzard games, the latest iteration has added a battle pass system and microtransactions, which is a bit annoying since the standard edition already costs $70. Thankfully, these are optional and only provide cosmetic rewards.\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, PC.\nAmong Us ($5)\nInnersloth, the relatively tiny developer behind the popular party/murder game Among Us, has brought the title to quite a few platforms that can all play with each other. Originally for iOS and Android, it now supports crossplay with PC and Nintendo Switch players along with every other major console.\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS.\nApex Legends (Free)\nRespawn's Apex Legends is a team-based shooter that comes with some complications for crossplay, but the game tackles it well. It supports playing across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation systems (both current and last-gen) and the Nintendo Switch. (There used to be a mobile version, but alas, no longer.)\nHowever, as shooter veterans know, playing with a keyboard and mouse provides a considerable advantage in terms of aiming. So if you're on a console, you can choose to turn off crossplay and stick to players on your own platform. PC players, on the other hand, are stuck with the feature turned on, so just hope you're better at clicking heads than someone with a control stick.\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch.\nDeathloop ($60)\nArkane Studios, the team behind widely popular games like Dishonored and Prey, introduced Deathloop as a whole new franchise in 2021. In this game, you take on the role of an assassin named Colt who finds himself stuck in a time loop while trying to take out eight different targets. Fail to take out even one, and the loop starts over, but this time you start with more knowledge and experience.\nAs a bonus, Deathloop also has an invasion system that, in WIRED staff writer Will Bedingfield's opinion, is the game's best feature. Invasions let players, well, invade each other's games. After a certain point, you can play as Colt's rival, Juliana, and try to prevent other players from succeeding. This feature has some limited crossplay. Xbox players can play with PC players who bought the game via the Microsoft Store, while Steam users can play with Epic users.\nAvailable on PC (Steam, Epic), Xbox, PlayStation.\nGenshin Impact (Free)\nIn developer miHoYo's action RPG gacha game Genshin Impact, players can join each others' adventures to tackle challenges together by sharing a UID code. This works across all the platforms the game supports, including Windows, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Android and iOS. The company has also announced a Switch version but hasn't announced a release window. When it does arrive, it should also be cross-compatible with all the other platforms.\nGenshin Impact, somewhat uniquely, supports cross-saving as well. So if you decide to play on your phone for a little while, you can keep all your progress when you go back to your console. It's a nice addition that makes this title one of those rare games where you can play anywhere with anyone and feel like you're jumping into the same game.\nAvailable on PlayStation, PC, Android, iOS.\nRocket League (Free)\nPsyonix's Rocket League has proved that its concept of ‚ÄúWhat if soccer, but with cars?‚Äù is an enduring one. And thanks to using Epic's Online Services platform, players on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, or PC can all play together. Interestingly, PC players that play the game via Epic Game Store or Steam can participate in the cross-platform action, despite Steam being a rival game store to Epic. Who says we can't all get along?\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC.\nFall Guys (Free)\nWhen Fall Guys first came on the scene, it was overshadowed by Among Us, but it has still maintained a healthy player base. This game is a battle royale‚Äîthough the most adorable one you've ever seen‚Äîwhere 60 players compete in game-show-style obstacle courses and arenas to be the last person (er, jelly bean) standing. Best of all, it's free-to-play, so you don't have to spend a dime to try it out.\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC.\nOvercooked! All You Can Eat ($40)\nIf you enjoy the chaos of working in a professional kitchen ‚Ä¶ well, then you've probably never done it in real life. Fortunately, Overcooked! All You Can Eat is a lot more fun than a real job. This game requires players to cooperate to prepare, cook, and plate food for customers in a rapid-fire environment. This version has added crossplay across a wide variety of platforms, so you can recruit chefs from just about anywhere.\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PC.\nNo Man's Sky ($60)\nFor a game that began life starring an isolated spacefarer exploring a vast and unfathomably lonely universe, any kind of crossplay is already a significant change. But as Hello Games has continued iterating on No Man's Sky, it has added online multiplayer features where you can bump into other travelers. You can interact with players across Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4 and 5. Even as Hello Studios prepares for the launch of its next game, No Man's Sky is still receiving constant major updates, altering core systems like planet construction, atmospheres, and even adding fishing. Plus, with VR support for PC, you can feel like you're behind the controls of your favorite starship.\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch.\nSmite 2 (Free)\nHi-Rez Studios' popular MOBA Smite gained immense popularity over the years, combining MOBA gameplay, a third-person perspective, and a unique theme that borrowed iconography and characters from real world religions. The sequel, Smite 2, recently left closed beta and is available for everyone to play for free. It boasts generational leaps in graphical quality and new features, and the studio is gradually adding gods from the old game into the new one, as well as new characters. Unfortunately, there are no plans for a Nintendo Switch port of the new game.\nWhile there will be some stability and maintenance updates, Hi-Rez Studios announced in February via Discord that the original game will receive no further major updates, and the Nintendo Switch servers would be shut down on May 1. As a result, anyone looking for their Smite fix should check out the sequel.\nAvailable on PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, Epic.\nSoon: Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 ($60+)\nLarian Studios' Baldur's Gate 3 was one of the biggest smash hits of 2023, hailed for its rich storytelling that allows players to feel their consequences have real weight. Just like the tabletop D&D it's based on, friends can play together in the same campaign. Up to four players can form a party and run through the story in tandem online.\nFor right now, that online multiplayer is limited to players who are on the same platform, but that will be changing at some point in the future. As I write this, Larian is running stress tests for crossplay, but in order to participate you'll need to register and be invited. Crossplay will be a major feature of Patch 8, which also adds support for a photo mode and a variety of new subclasses.\nAvailable on PC, PlayStation, Xbox.",

    "content_text": "The US Food and Drug Administration has determined that semaglutide is no longer in shortage, a move that will have implications for patients taking cheaper, compounded versions of the drug.\nSemaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk‚Äôs blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss medications Ozempic and Wegovy, has been on the FDA‚Äôs shortage list since March 2022. Supply could not keep pace with fervent demand for the drug, which reached such dizzying levels of popularity that it transformed Novo Nordisk into one of the world‚Äôs most valuable companies, with a market capitalization larger than the rest of the economy of its home nation of Denmark.\nIn the intervening years, a lucrative industry of telehealth companies, medical spas, and pharmacies making and selling ‚Äúcompounded‚Äù copies of the medications has arisen. These off-brand copies are sold at a steep discount‚Äîsometimes under $100 a vial‚Äîcompared to the name-brand medications, which can be over $1,000 a month without insurance.\nAt the end of October, the FDA changed the status of all dosages of Ozempic and Wegovy to ‚Äúavailable,‚Äù signaling that the end of the official shortage was likely in sight. It took until today, nearly four months later, for regulators to conclude that the drug was widely available enough to remove it from the shortage list.\nThe FDA is giving ‚Äú503A‚Äù compounders, typically state-licensed pharmacies or physician compounders that run smaller operations, until April 22 to cease producing the drug. It is giving ‚Äú503B‚Äù compounders, which are larger outsourcing facilities that follow stricter manufacturing guidelines, until May 22.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, it‚Äôs not especially contentious when drugs come off a shortage list. But there is reason to believe that players within this industry will push back on this announcement.\nDrug compounding is a well-established practice; pharmacists are permitted to make copies of medications when there‚Äôs a drug shortage or when patients need versions made in specific dosages or without allergens. But the GLP-1 boom has created an opportunity for compounders that has transformed pockets of the industry, with compounding pharmacies producing off-brand duplicates for likely millions of patients.\nRobert MacArthur, director of pharmacy at the Rockefeller University Hospital, says that once a drug comes off the FDA shortage list, outsourcing pharmacies that make large batches of compounded drugs for health care facilities are not supposed to compound that drug anymore. But for smaller, traditional compounding pharmacies that make drugs for home use, it‚Äôs a legal gray area.\n‚ÄúThey can compound it if the physician writes the prescription for an individual patient and feels there‚Äôs some compelling reason why that given patient needs that special compounded product,‚Äù MacArthur says. That reason could be adjusting the dose or tailoring the medication to a specific patient.\nSome telehealth outfits have signaled their intention to continue offering their products.‚ÄúNow that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,‚Äù Andrew Dudum, founder and CEO of Hims & Hers Health, wrote on X, adding that the company is closely monitoring potential future shortages.\nIn December, the FDA declared that tirzepatide, the other popular GLP-1 drug, was no longer in shortage. The small 503A compounders had 60 days to stop production, while the larger 503B outsourcing facilities had 90 days to wrap up sales. Eli Lilly, which sells tirzepatide under the brand names Mounjaro and Zepbound, sent a flurry of cease-and-desist letters to hundreds of companies selling compounded versions. The compounding industry pushed back, with a trade group filing a lawsuit against the FDA, arguing that the drug was actually still hard to access for patients. As of now, the FDA has set deadlines for compounders to stop producing tirzepatide products, but it is not enforcing the deadlines at the moment as the lawsuit is ongoing.\nNovo Nordisk has already attempted to curb the compounded semaglutide market. It has filed over 50 lawsuits against compounders, telehealth clinics, and medspas, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. More recently, it has petitioned the FDA to block production of compounded semaglutide by placing the ingredient on the ‚ÄúDemonstrable Difficulties for Compounding‚Äù list, which excludes drugs that are too difficult to compound safely.\n‚ÄúWe are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand. No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients,‚Äù Novo Nordisk executive Dave Moore said in a statement. (The FDA does not evaluate compounded medications for safety, quality, or efficacy before they are sold.)\n‚ÄúI think the compounders have a real valid argument,‚Äù MacArthur says. ‚ÄúThis is a drug that is going to prolong people‚Äôs lives and meaningfully increase the quality of their life. You‚Äôve already got a whole population of compounders out there that are making it, the product quality is adequate, people are using it, and then you‚Äôre suddenly going to take it away? I mean, I think that that would create a public uproar.‚Äù\nUpdated: 2/21/2024, 2:29 pm EST: This story was updated to quote from a post from the founder and CEO of Hims & Hers Health.",

Supply could not keep pace with <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/gadget-lab-podcast-650/\">fervent demand for the drug</a>, which reached such dizzying levels of popularity that it transformed Novo Nordisk into one of the world‚Äôs most valuable companies, with <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/01/novo-nordisk-market-value-570-billion-bigger-than-danish-denmark-economy/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/01/novo-nordisk-market-value-570-billion-bigger-than-danish-denmark-economy/\" href=\"https://fortune.com/europe/2024/05/01/novo-nordisk-market-value-570-billion-bigger-than-danish-denmark-economy/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a market capitalization</a> larger than the rest of the economy of its home nation of Denmark.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In the intervening years, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/glp1-ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-compounding-pharmacies-hims-reflexmd-alan-meds-henry-ro-getthinmd/\">a lucrative industry</a> of telehealth companies, medical spas, and pharmacies <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/telehealth-companies-compounded-glp-1-pills-ozempic-wegovy-novo-nordisk-zepbound-mounjaro-eli-lilly/\">making and selling ‚Äúcompounded‚Äù copies</a> of the medications has arisen.

But there is reason to believe that players within this industry will push back on this announcement.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Drug compounding is a well-established practice; pharmacists are permitted to make copies of medications when there‚Äôs a drug shortage or when patients need versions made in specific dosages or without allergens. But the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/glp-1/\">GLP-1</a> boom has created an opportunity for compounders that has transformed pockets of the industry, with compounding pharmacies producing off-brand duplicates for likely millions of patients.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Robert MacArthur, director of pharmacy at the Rockefeller University Hospital, says that once a drug comes off the FDA shortage list, outsourcing pharmacies that make large batches of compounded drugs for health care facilities are not supposed to compound that drug anymore. But for smaller, traditional compounding pharmacies that make drugs for home use, it‚Äôs a legal gray area.</p><p class=\"paywall\">‚ÄúThey can compound it if the physician writes the prescription for an individual patient and feels there‚Äôs some compelling reason why that given patient needs that special compounded product,‚Äù MacArthur says.

    "content_text": "The Best Meat Subscription Boxes for Carnivores\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nFinding high-quality meat at your local grocery store can be difficult. Richly marbled and grass-fed beef, pasture-raised pork, and free-range chicken are uncommon in these days of industrial meat production. If you're lucky enough to live near a good butcher shop, start there, or try buying direct from your local farmer. If you can't find a local farm, the next-best option is ordering online.\nEven better, try one of these meat subscription boxes, which will bring a variety of cuts‚Äîfrom ground beef and dry-aged ribeye steaks to pasture-raised pork and chicken, even fish‚Äîto your door every month. Whether you want filet mignon, an organic free-range chicken breast, or a delicious cut of wild-caught salmon, there's something here for every type of carnivore.\nBe sure to check out our other buying guides to subscription boxes, including the Best Subscription Boxes, Best Snack Subscription Boxes, Best Kids Subscription Boxes, and Best Coffee Subscriptions.\nUpdated February 2025: We've added new boxes from Wild Alaskan Company, Pasturebird, and Good Chop.\nWhat Is Grass-Fed Beef?\nGrass-Fed? Grass-Finished? Pasture-Raised? What The?\nThe USDA, which oversees beef production in the US, says grass-fed means that ‚Äúgrass and forage shall be the feed source consumed for the lifetime of the ruminant animal, with the exception of milk consumed prior to weaning. The diet shall be derived solely from forage consisting of grass ‚Ä¶ Animals cannot be fed grain or grain byproducts and must have continuous access to pasture during the growing season.\"\nIn other words, grass-fed cows can eat only grass. All cows start life eating grass. While farming practices vary, generally cows start nursing, grazing, and living in pasture for the first six months or so of life. Then conventionally raised cattle are moved to feedlots for three to four months (sometimes more) where they are fed grain, a more economical way of getting them to market.\nThere's still considerable variation between grass-fed beef though, even ‚Äúgrass-finished beef.‚Äù Turns out the definition of ‚Äúgrass‚Äù varies. The best grass-fed beef tends to stay at pasture (ideally organic pasture that isn't sprayed with pesticides), while the much more common grass-fed beef you find prepackaged at your local supermarket is sent to feed lots and fed grass pellets. The best way to get grass-fed beef that you know comes from cows that actually ate grass is to get to know your local ranchers and family farms. If you don't have local ranchers, that's where this guide comes in.\nShould You Buy Grass-Fed Beef?\nGenerally speaking, grass-fed beef has more complex flavors and has less fat. Individual examples vary wildly. Grass-fed beef has a stronger flavor. Some people dislike it, describing it as \"gamy\" or \"barnyard-y.\" In my experience testing for this guide and more broadly, it comes down to what you're used to. Having eaten a lot of grass-fed beef, I find grain-fed beef bland.\nA key point to grass-fed beef: It usually cooks faster. In my experience, a part of the reason people say grass-fed beef is tough is that they overcook it. Make sure you get a good meat thermometer. I like the Thermapen One ($109), but this cheaper alternative will also get the job done.\nOne thing that deserves disputing is the idea that grain-fed beef is more marbled with fat (and therefore has better flavor). In my experience, this is false. It's not the grass, it's the breed of cattle. This is why Wagyu beef is sought after; it‚Äôs a breed with high levels of marbling. Crowd Cow has a good blog post explaining how factors like cattle breed affect marbling and how to decipher the USDA rating system for marbling. My suggestion is to try some grass-fed beef from various sources to get a sense of what it's like. If you like it, order more. If it's not to your liking, don't bother.",

These days I am fortunate to live in a rural community with access to fresh pastured meat and veggies of all kinds, but trips to the local fishmonger? Not so much. The local specialty is whitefish and lake trout, but we're a good ways from the sea. That's why the subscription boxes from Wild Alaskan Company caught my eye. Wild Alaskan Company offers wild-caught seafood from Alaska and Pacific Northwest waters. The box I tested, the Wild Combo Box, was a generous mix of Pacific rockfish, coho salmon, sockeye salmon, Pacific halibut, and Pacific cod, all in 6-ounce portions (12 in total).</p><p>The fillets were all delicious, without the fishiness that sometimes comes with frozen fish (yes, even flash-frozen fish). If I had a criticism it would be that the fillets were all on the thin side. If you wanted to grill the salmon, for instance, a thicker fillet might be nice. That said, since I was saut√©ing, the thinner fillets were fine.</p><p>The packaging is all nicely biodegradable, shipped with dry ice in a cardboard box. My testing was done in winter in Wisconsin, so I have no way to test how long the dry ice would last in the heat, but based on the amount used, and my experience with other boxes, I would not worry about a box sitting out on the porch for a day in summer. The company is also very responsive about changing or pausing your order if you're headed out of town.</p></div></div></div></body></html>",

In 1920‚Äîwell before Alan Turing devised his famous test and decades before the 1956 summer Dartmouth conference that gave artificial intelligence its name‚Äîa Czech playwright named Karel ƒåapek wrote R.U.R.‚ÄîRossum‚Äôs Universal Robots. Not only was this the first time the word ‚Äúrobot‚Äù was employed, but ƒåapek may qualify as the first AI doomer, since his play dramatized an android uprising that slaughtered all of humanity, save for a single soul.\nAlso on the boards in New York City this winter was a small black-box production called Doomers, a thinly veiled dramatization of the weekend where OpenAI‚Äôs nonprofit board gave Sam Altman the boot, only to see him return after an employee rebellion.\nNeither of these productions have the pizzazz of a splashy Broadway extravaganza‚Äîmaybe later we‚Äôll buy tickets to a musical where Altman and Elon Musk have a dance-off‚Äîbut both grapple with issues that reverberate in Silicon Valley conference rooms, Congressional hearings, and late-night drinking sessions at the annual NeurIPS conference. The artists behind these plays reveal a justifiable obsession with how superintelligent AI might affect‚Äîor take over‚Äîthe human creative process.\nDoomers is the work of Matthew Gasda, a playwright and screenwriter whose works zero in on the zeitgeist. His previous plays have included Dimes Square, about downtown hipsters, and Zoomers, whose characters are Gen-Z Brooklynites. Gasda tells me that when he read about the OpenAI Blip, he saw it as an opportunity to take on weightier fare than young New Yorkers. Altman‚Äôs ejection and eventual restoration had a definite Shakespearian vibe. Gasda‚Äôs two-act play on the topic features two separate casts, one depicting the Altman character‚Äôs team in exile and the other focused on the board‚Äîincluding a genuine doomer seemingly based on AI theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky, and a greedy venture capitalist‚Äîas they realize that their coup is backfiring. Both groups do a lot of gabbing about the perils, promise, and morality of AI while they snipe about their predicaments.\nNot surprisingly, they don‚Äôt come up with anything like a solution. The first act ends with the dramatis personae taking shots of booze; in act two, the characters gobble mushrooms. When I mention to Gasda that it seems like his characters are ducking the consequences of building AI, he says that was intentional. ‚ÄúIf the play has a message, it‚Äôs something like that,‚Äù he says. He adds that there‚Äôs an even darker angle. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of suggestions that the fictional LLM is biding its time and manipulating the characters. It‚Äôs up to audiences to decide whether that‚Äôs total hokum or whether that‚Äôs potentially real.‚Äù (Doomers is still running in Brooklyn and will open in San Francisco in March.)\nMcNeal, a Broadway production with a movie star who famously played a character based on Elon Musk, is a more ambitious work, with flashing screens that project prompts and outputs as if AI is itself a character. Downey‚Äôs Jacob McNeal, a narcissistic novelist and substance abuser, who gains the Nobel and loses his soul, winds up hooked on perhaps the most dangerous substance of all‚Äîthe lure of instant virtuosity from a large language model.\nBoth playwrights are concerned about how deeply AI will become entangled in the writing process. In an interview in The Atlantic, Akhtar, a Pulitzer winner, says that hours of experimentation with LLMs helped him write a better play. He even gives ChatGPT the literal last word. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a play about AI,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúIt stands to reason that I was able, over the course of many months, to finally get the AI to give me something that I could use in the play.‚Äù Meanwhile, while Gasda gave dramaturgy credits to ChatGPT and Claude in the Doomers program, he worries that AI will steal his words, speculating that to preserve their uniqueness, human writers might revert to paper to hide their work from content-hungry AI companies. He‚Äôs also just finished a novel set in 2040 ‚Äúabout a writer who sold all of his works to AI and has nothing to do.‚Äù\nTheater itself is probably the art least threatened by AI. Its essence consists of flesh-and-blood actors making words come to life on stage and forging a direct connection to an audience whose iPhones are (hopefully) deep in their pockets. As Akhtar said in the Atlantic interview, ‚ÄúThere is something irreducibly human about the theater, and ‚Ä¶ over time, it is going to continue to demonstrate its value in a world where virtuality is increasingly the norm.‚Äù I found McNeal‚Äôs ending particularly powerful, as we learn that our protagonist has perhaps fallen too far into the rabbit hole of ChatGPT. The performance ends on an apparently chatbot-created Shakespearean note that left us not only wondering how much of the protagonist‚Äôs work was generated by AI but also whether the playwright had followed him into that same rabbit hole. I had the vertiginous feeling that reality itself had been bent by the newly fuzzy line between thought and algorithm. That‚Äôs good theater.\nAnd then the lights went on in Lincoln Center and I was back in the mundane physical world, only to discover that the bald head inches from my knees in the seat in front of me belonged to the ultimate real-life AI accelerationist, Marc Andreessen. Even ChatGPT couldn‚Äôt have come up with a better plot twist.",

    "content_text": "You‚Äôre driving along, minding your own business, and‚ÄîTING! Something smacks your windshield. You didn't see it coming, but the glass is cracked. Where the heck did it come from, and why did it hit your windshield?\nAs I always say, you don‚Äôt understand something unless you can model it. So let‚Äôs try a little thought experiment. We‚Äôll start with a basic scenario, where someone ahead of you drops an object in the road, and then see what we need to make it work.\nFollow the Bouncing Ball\nOK, imagine a car is driving in front of you at 30 miles per hour. A child in the back seat takes a bouncy ball and drops it out of the window. Why would they do this? Who knows why children do things. This is what it would look like to someone on the side of the road:\nIs that what you expected? The ball bounces up, but it continues to move along with the car. This is because when the ball is released, it's horizontal velocity is the same as the car‚Äôs. The only change is in its vertical velocity: The gravitational force causes it to move down until it hits the ground, at which point, it rebounds upwards. As you can see, it won‚Äôt hit the car behind.\nOh, but what about air drag? It‚Äôs true, as the ball moves through the air, it collides with air molecules. This produces a force in the opposite direction. The magnitude of this drag force depends on the speed of the moving ball and its size. Plugging in some reasonable values, its motion now looks like this.\nNow the ball behaves more like you would expect. Its horizontal velocity decreases so that it falls behind the original car. But it‚Äôs still not going to hit your windshield. With air drag and loss of energy on impact with the ground, each bounce is a little lower than the one before. You should be fine.\nRock Out\nNow say that kid drops a rock out the window. Kids! Or maybe there‚Äôs a truck carrying gravel, and some of it slips through a crack. When the rock hits the road, its motion can change in a few ways. First, there's a frictional force between the rock and the road, which will reduce the rock's horizontal velocity. As we saw above, slower is bad.\nSecond‚Äîand this can seem weird‚Äîbecause a rock is irregularly shaped, it's possible that it spins and hits the pavement in a way that makes it skip up higher than it started.\nHold on! Isn‚Äôt that a violation of the law? You know, the law of conservation of energy? Nope, it‚Äôs an energy transfer. A rotating and moving rock has both rotational and translational (linear) kinetic energy. Some collisions can convert rotational energy to translational energy, which makes the rock bounce higher. Higher is bad.\nHere's what that might look like:\nSo you‚Äôre cruising along the highway at, say, 70 miles an hour‚Äîand there's a rock up in the air at the top of its path. It's momentarily at rest, but you aren‚Äôt. Let the court take note: The rock didn‚Äôt hit you. You hit the rock. But the effect is the same. Either way, you need a new windshield.\nRock and Roll\nThat‚Äôs a plausible scenario, but what if there is no truck in front of you? Actually, a more common cause of windshield damage is a rock lying in the road that gets kicked up by another vehicle. You might think it gets shot back at the car behind, but that‚Äôs not quite right. The rock still doesn‚Äôt move backward.\nPicture this: a wheel is rolling along the road and a rock gets wedged between the tire treads. When the rock comes in contact with the ground, it‚Äôs at rest. Here's what that would look like:\nWhat if the rock falls off at the exact moment when it is in contact with the ground? Well, at that point the velocity of the rock with respect to the ground is zero. It would just be another dumb rock on the road. No big deal.\nBut wait! What if the rock sticks to the tire just a bit longer and then gets released, maybe due to the flexing of the rubber. In this case the rock could have a significant upward velocity. Here, let me show you. This is a faster-rolling wheel so I've slowed down the animation a little:\nThis is bad. Now we have this rock moving upward with very little horizontal velocity. That means it's just going to be sitting there in midair waiting for the next car to slam into it. Now it‚Äôs true, a rock is more likely to get jammed in the treads of a big truck tire. But that‚Äôs why big trucks have mud flaps‚Äîthose rubber flaps that hang down behind the wheel.\nI know, having to replace your windshield sucks. but just remember, your car probably collided with the rock, so it‚Äôs not really the rock‚Äôs fault. You want to avoid flying rocks? It‚Äôs pretty simple, really: Move back! Stop following so close.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nTP-Link is one of the most popular router manufacturers in the US, but the company is facing a potential ban due to security concerns about its links to China. A December report from The Wall Street Journal revealed that the US Commerce, Defense, and Justice Departments are investigating TP-Link, though no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing has yet emerged.\n‚ÄúWe are a US company,‚Äù Jeff Barney, president of TP-Link told WIRED, ‚ÄúWe have no affiliation with TP-Link Tech, which focuses on mainland China, and we can prove our separateness.‚Äù\nThe investigation was sparked by a letter from John Moolenaar, a Republican for Michigan, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat of Illinois. Both are on the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. They outlined concerns that Chinese state-sponsored hackers may be able to compromise TP-Link‚Äôs routers more easily than other brands and thereby infiltrate US systems, and that TP-Link is subject to Chinese law, meaning it can be forced to hand over sensitive US information by Chinese intelligence officials.\nTP-Link was founded in China in 1996 by two brothers, and TP-Link USA was established in 2008. It wasn‚Äôt until 2022 that the Chinese and US wings began to split. The process of moving the 170 subsidiaries and all the related ownership out of Hong Kong and into the United States was delayed by the pandemic, says Barney, but it was divested and restructured by 2024.\nTP-Link now has headquarters in California, a branch in Singapore, and manufactures in Vietnam. It researches, designs, develops, and manufactures everything except chipsets in-house, according to Barney. ‚ÄúOur entities in China are governed directly by us, our employees badged by us, secured by us, in our own facilities.‚Äù He also says TP-Link has shared documentation with investigators and that its factory in Vietnam was audited by US retail partners like Walmart, Best Buy, and Costco.\n‚ÄúEverybody has a Nexus in China,‚Äù Barney says. He claims that American rival Netgear uses Chinese ODMs (original device manufacturers) to build its products and that even Apple relies on manufacturing in China. Netgear says its routers are manufactured in Taiwan, Vietnam, and Thailand, not China.\nCompetition Concerns\nThe WSJ report suggests that TP-Link has a leading 64.9 percent share of the US router market, but TP-Link disputes this. The company claims its share hovered around 20 percent for the last few years, but jumped to a 36.5 percent unit share and a 30.7 percent dollar share in 2024, according to Circana data. But even TP-Link‚Äôs lower estimate shows a company in the ascendancy. This dominance has been driven by aggressively low prices and a relatively early roll-out of Wi-Fi 7 routers, perceived by some as a concerted effort to flood the US market.\n‚ÄúTechnology should not be exorbitant,‚Äù Barney says. ‚ÄúWe're trying to democratize these products.‚Äù\nHowever, the wide product range raises questions, with many wondering how TP-Link can profit from routers sold at such low prices compared to the competition. Former CNET reviewer Dong Ngo explores this point on the in-depth router review website, Dong Knows.\nConcerns about the links between Chinese companies and its government are nothing new. The ban on Huawei‚Äôs networking equipment and US sanctions came after years of cybersecurity concerns and intellectual property lawsuits brought by US companies. The TikTok ban is not being enforced by President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration, but owner ByteDance is still under pressure to divest its US operations. These situations can be tricky for the average person to navigate because the lines between shoddy security, Chinese espionage, US protectionism, and the growing trade war are distinctly blurry and are not mutually exclusive.\nIt‚Äôs no secret that US competitor Netgear has been lobbying the US government on ‚Äúcybersecurity and strategic competition with China.‚Äù Netgear has had a tough couple of years after adopting a premium pricing strategy that did not resonate with consumers. It has also been embroiled in litigation against TP-Link for patent infringement, resulting in TP-Link paying a $135 million settlement in September 2024.\nAre TP-Link Routers Secure?\nTP-Link has signed CISA‚Äôs ‚ÄúSecure by Design‚Äù pledge and is part of the Technical Exchange Group. It has a vulnerability disclosure program, where independent researchers and the security community can report potential issues to security@tp-link.com. It claims report response time was 8.4 days on average in 2023, with patches released in an average of 38.5 days. The company is also planning to launch a bug bounty program.\nBarney claims TP-Link‚Äôs rate of vulnerabilities per product is significantly lower than many of its peers, including Netgear and Cisco, citing public data collected by Finite State, an independent US cybersecurity company, from CVE Details, VulDB, and CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), but not everyone agrees.\n‚ÄúTP-Link does not have a great reputation for patching vulnerabilities or working with security researchers, which does raise alarm bells,‚Äù Pieter Arntz, malware intelligence researcher for Malwarebytes told WIRED via email.\nTP-Link was criticized in a recent Microsoft report over a ‚Äúpassword spraying‚Äù hack that mostly impacted its routers, and the report suggested Chinese ‚Äúnation-state threat actor activity.‚Äù Barney says these were end-of-service products and that Asus and Netgear routers were also impacted.\nOther incidents include a Check Point Research expos√© of a malicious firmware implant for TP-Link routers, linked to a Chinese state-sponsored ‚Äúadvanced persistent threat‚Äù group dubbed ‚ÄúCamaro Dragon.‚Äù Cyfirma researchers also found TP-Link router vulnerabilities for sale on underground forums.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also a challenge because regardless of the home router vendor, there will always be vulnerabilities found,‚Äù Arntz says.\nA part of the problem with older routers is that the onus is often on the user to download and install updates, and this is rarely automatic or as simple as clicking on ‚Äúupdate,‚Äù which means many patches are never installed, creating vulnerable devices for any savvy cybercriminals or nation-states. Even months after TP-Link released patches for a vulnerability on its popular Archer AX21 router, hackers continue to scan for and exploit it on unpatched routers.\nThese security concerns are moot in the face of built-in backdoors. Backdoors can be pieces of code or even hardware added to the circuit board that enables remote parties to gain access and potentially control the device. There‚Äôs no evidence that TP-Link devices have backdoors, but, as Ngo points out, when you use an online account with your router, you are already giving the company access through the front door. Whether remote connectivity is justified by the need for automatic software updates, remote control access, or other features for users, it effectively gives the manufacturer access to your router.\nShould You Worry?\nUltimately, the concern isn‚Äôt so much about the Chinese government or other malicious actors spying on your web browsing habits‚Äîthough that is possible‚Äîit‚Äôs the idea they might employ your router as a part of a botnet to launch a cyberattack on a US government agency or major service provider.\nThe NSA has been concerned about Chinese hackers for some time now, and China's Salt Typhoon spies continue to infiltrate US internet service providers and telecommunications companies. Speaking on the NatSec Tech podcast recently, former special assistant to the president and cybersecurity coordinator on the US National Security Council, Rob Joyce, likened TP-Link routers to a Trojan Horse and suggested China is pre-positioning for a potentially devastating attack on US infrastructure.\nWhile some cybersecurity experts suggest a ban is imminent, Barney is confident that TP-Link routers won‚Äôt be banned. Investigations are ongoing. Even if the government doesn't find anything or decides against a ban, it won‚Äôt publicly clear TP-Link. It‚Äôs more likely the investigation will fade from the news.\nFor owners of a TP-Link router or anyone considering buying one, it all boils down to trust. We've tested and recommend several TP-Link routers and Deco mesh systems in our buying guides because they offer good value and great performance. But we continually update our guides and will monitor the situation before deciding whether we need to reconsider those recommendations.\nThere‚Äôs no easy fix because all the major router manufacturers have issues with vulnerabilities, and most of them require you to use an online account. You can go down the rabbit hole with router security, or seek out security-focused brands like Firewalla, but expect to pay more for your equipment in both time and money.\nEven if you stick with what you have, there are steps you can take to be more secure online. We recommend using a VPN service and learning a little about router settings. Malwarebytes‚Äô Arntz says the most secure router is the one on which you are comfortable changing the settings: credentials, firewall options, and especially installing updates.\nHere‚Äôs his advice for home TP-Link router owners who are concerned:\n- First, update your login credentials. Ensure you have moved away from the default login credentials set by the router manufacturer (or internet provider). Make this password different from your Wi-Fi name and password. And remember, length equals strength when it comes to passwords.\n- Second, patch your device and set a reminder to check regularly for firmware updates.\n- Third, turn on the firewall and Wi-Fi encryption. You can find these settings by logging into your router from its app or website.\n- Finally, consider purchasing a new router from a different vendor with a less problematic history.\nTP-Link also manufactures a wide range of smart home devices marketed under the Tapo brand, including everything from security cameras to water leak detectors. These are not part of the current investigation, which seems to be focused solely on routers. TP-Link says it has applied to the FCC‚Äôs Cyber Trust Mark program administered by UL Solutions, which ensures that internet-of-things devices are tested and labeled secure. Sadly, there is no such program for routers.",

    "content_text": "The mood during the second half of the 2024 NCAA women‚Äôs basketball national title game was predictably intense.\nIn what would later be revealed as the most-watched women‚Äôs college game of all time, the undefeated South Carolina Gamecocks were looking to close out a perfect season against Iowa and superstar Caitlin Clark. The score margin had rarely left single digits. Players on both squads were leaving everything on the floor.\nAs Gamecocks coach Dawn Staley instructed her team during time-outs, trainers passed around the typical things athletes need to recover from an intense effort: water bottles, towels, sports drinks. Also being passed around, though, were handheld devices featuring a metal container and copper extensions, which several SC players held at each break. These thick black cylinders had small copper tubes coming out of their tops, tapered off to look almost like an oversized wine bottle being held by its neck.\nThese are ‚Äúpalm-cooling‚Äù devices called Narwhals, so named for their visual similarity to the protruding tusks of narwhal whales. They‚Äôre made by Apex Cool Labs, one of several companies manufacturing these types of devices, all of which are designed to rapidly cool an athlete‚Äôs palms. Gripping the copper tubes initiates a sort of physiological trick: When you cool the palms (or foot soles) of a human who‚Äôs stressed from exertion, their core temperature drops as well. Their heart rate normalizes more quickly, and they can bounce back from heat stress more effectively and in less time.\nGamecocks point guard Raven Johnson says the entire team uses the Narwhals, during both games and practices. The devices are especially helpful for high-volume players like Johnson, who led the team in court time all season and played 37 of a possible 40 minutes in that national title game last April, helping South Carolina eventually pull away for a win to top off an unbeaten championship season.\n‚ÄúWhen you put your hands on it, it cools you down,‚Äù Johnson says. ‚ÄúIt literally slows my heart rate down. It helped me with my breathing.‚Äù\nPalm cooling, also known as palmar cooling or vasocooling, was discovered over 20 years ago by Stanford University researchers. But it didn‚Äôt find its way into the mainstream until recently.\nHigh-level athletes across numerous sports have begun adopting palm cooling as a training and recovery tool to fight against the known effects of heat stress on the body‚Äîeffects that are only growing more significant as climate change makes conditions hotter across many sports. They‚Äôre not the only ones looking to chill; both clinical research and a growing body of anecdotal evidence suggest the technology is beneficial across a wide range of heat-stressed fields, including firefighting, industrial work, and the medical world. Many of palmar cooling‚Äôs proponents believe it‚Äôs primed for an even bigger explosion. ‚ÄúI think it can go worldwide, honestly,‚Äù Johnson says.\nIs palm-cooling technology a legitimate tool to combat heat stress in a warming world, one that could someday be as ubiquitous as Gatorade or cooling fans? Or is it just another fad that will pass once the hype dies down?\nWhen the US military needed a portable way to cool overheated personnel in Iraq in the early 2000s, it turned to a team of Stanford University researchers led by biologists H. Craig Heller and Dennis Grahn.\nHeller and Grahn had related experience: They had previously researched the thermal mechanisms of bears, who radiate heat via the non-furry skin on the pads of their feet. The researchers realized humans have similar functions in their palms, foot soles, and parts of the face, known collectively as ‚Äúglabrous‚Äù skin areas, which are hairless and contain blood vessels that dilate and contract quickly and widely. The team hypothesized that temperature could rapidly be extracted from the vessels in these areas. Armed with Darpa funding, they set to work developing devices to extract heat from these glabrous skin areas, primarily via the palms for convenience reasons.\nThey performed a range of studies across several years, often using Stanford student athletes or professionals who lived in the area as test subjects. Several early discoveries would set the foundation for palm-cooling devices moving forward.\nOne was the ideal temperature range of the palm-cooling device. A common query from people newly exposed to palm cooling reads something like, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I just grab a soda can from the fridge and hold onto that?‚Äù If the part that comes in contact with the skin of the palm is too cold, the blood vessels in the palm meant to dilate and increase blood flow will instead constrict, causing the opposite effect. Most of today‚Äôs palm-cooling devices target a consistent temperature range of somewhere between 45 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe Stanford team had issues bringing a consumer product to market for much of the 2010s, due to both lack of demand for palm-cooling devices and limitations with their designs. But in 2020, former Navy member and ex-basketball player Craig Gile cofounded CoolMitt, a company that licensed the Stanford patents and brought Heller and Grahn in as advisers.\nCoolMitt quickly set the standard for palm-cooling devices when it hit the market. Updated models have since appeared, including a design with a still-unique palm insertion method that requires no actual gripping from the user. The mitt just slips onto the wearer‚Äôs hand. (The company‚Äôs signature CoolMitt costs $995. Narwhals are cheaper, $399 for a set of two.)\nAll these devices work similarly. Users either grip or insert their hand into the device when in a heat-stressed state. They maintain this position for a set amount of time as they rest‚Äîit could be as little as 30 seconds or as long as several minutes. As blood passes through the palm, the device extracts heat and returns cooler blood to the rest of the body. Most athletes hold the device in one hand, while some are designed to be held by both hands. Pricier devices like CoolMitt are designed to stay at the target temperature for long periods, while less expensive options need to be recooled after an hour or so.\nEven as palm-cooling products proliferated, mainstream adoption was slow. But once many of the world‚Äôs best athletes and trainers started incorporating these gadgets into their recovery routines, that started to change.\nBetween periods of a game during the Edmonton Oilers‚Äô run to the Stanley Cup Finals in June of last year, the Hockey Night In Canada broadcast cut to a shot of star Connor McDavid in the locker room. Legendary host Ron MacLean noticed teammate Zach Hyman sitting beside McDavid with an intently focused look on his face, holding onto strange-looking items with both hands. MacLean wondered aloud, almost with a chuckle: ‚ÄúWhat is Zach Hyman doing?‚Äù\nYou guessed it: He was palm-cooling.\nHyman is one of several Oilers players who uses Apex‚Äôs Narwhals, and not just between periods‚Äîthey‚Äôre even used on the bench in between player shifts. The Oilers experimented with other devices, including CoolMitt, but found the Narwhals more affordable and convenient. (That bottle-like shape comes in handy; the Narwhals fit into the water bottle slots that sit in front of players on the bench.)\n‚ÄúI really enjoyed using the palm coolers, especially in warmer climates like Dallas and South Florida,‚Äù Hyman told WIRED in an email. ‚ÄúWhen you get into May and June, the buildings become hotter to play in. I found the palm coolers helped in cooling my body temperature down.‚Äù\nColumbus Blue Jackets forward James van Riemsdyk was intrigued when he first heard about palm cooling through a performance coach. It didn‚Äôt even take him a full game to see the benefits.\n‚ÄúThe first game I used it, going into the second and third period, I noticed a difference,‚Äù van Riemsdyk says. ‚ÄúI just felt a little clearer mentally, then physically felt a little bit less heavy or fatigued as the game went on ‚Ä¶ It made me a believer.‚Äù\nVan Riemsdyk has used the tech ever since, including through a team change this past summer.\nPalm cooling can now be found across virtually every major sport. It‚Äôs used by NBA, NHL, MLB, and NFL players and teams, plus in tennis, soccer, and several Olympic sports. The USA Wrestling team brought a CoolMitt with them to the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, using it for athletes between matches. Some of the biggest names in athletics, from Novak Djokovic and Joel Embiid to Katie Ledecky and Nolan Arenado, have been spotted using palm-cooling devices.\nUsers I spoke to reported improved endurance, slowed heart rate, and several similar effects from using the devices. Many of these claims are backed up by limited but convincing clinical research. For many, the effects are virtually immediate.\n‚ÄúI [felt] it right away, as soon as [sports performance coach Molly Binetti] handed it to me,‚Äù says MiLaysia Fulwiley, a guard for South Carolina women‚Äôs basketball team. Fulwiley had been struggling with labored breathing and fatigue during game timeouts before trying the Narwhals. ‚ÄúI wrapped my hand around it, and my heart just started beating a little slower. It made me be able to breathe.‚Äù\nSome users even report mental benefits from palmar cooling, though there‚Äôs little research to suggest the technique has any calming psychological effects. Palm cooling seems to offer a sort of centering effect for certain athletes; not relaxation, per se, but a grounded sensation. ‚ÄúIt makes it easier for me to concentrate and focus on what [Coach Staley] said [during a timeout],‚Äù Fulwiley says.\nPalm cooling‚Äôs purported benefits likely raise the most eyebrows in strength-training fields. Some research has suggested palm cooling can provide effects similar to or even greater than anabolic steroids for muscle recovery and subsequent volume increases among strength trainers. This is easily the most controversial claim the Stanford team makes, but they stand by it even despite the skepticism it draws in some circles.\n‚ÄúWhy would you use an inferior method that‚Äôs illegal and is not healthy,‚Äù Heller posits, ‚Äúwhen you can get much greater benefits and effects with a system which is not going to jeopardize your health and is perfectly legal?‚Äù\nWhether those claims hold water may ultimately be irrelevant for palm cooling‚Äôs future, where many of its most fascinating potential uses don‚Äôt involve sports at all.\nWhen firefighters in Loudoun County, Virginia, hit a certain time limit for work inside a major fire or related threat situation, they enter a unit called Rehab 623 for cooling and recovery. They must meet temperature, blood pressure, and pulse rate benchmarks to return to duty; if they fail to do so, it often results in hospitalization.\nCaptain Scott Lantz says Rehab 623 is outfitted with over two dozen Narwhals from Apex, among other cooling tools. The department also uses the units for various training exercises, which often involve entire days spent wearing heavy protective gear. Palm cooling has had a remarkable impact.\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything we‚Äôve used that can even touch this,‚Äù Lantz says. ‚ÄúThe cost of use per time is not high. It‚Äôs probably about the price of a Gatorade. If you look at the [research] that has been done, it‚Äôs pointing to yes, it really does work, it‚Äôs not just a placebo effect.‚Äù\nThat research is incredibly wide-ranging. The studies suggest palmar cooling shows benefits for everything from multiple sclerosis and menopausal hot flashes to various industrial use cases. The Stanford team has tested a fully portable in-suit palm-cooling method meant for Ebola treatment doctors in Africa, with positive initial results. AVA Cooling, a company offering a $70 device‚Äîmuch less expensive than CoolMitt or Apex‚Äîhas developed a sleep protocol for people who struggle to relax after late-night sports or workouts. The protocol involves an initial cycle of cooling using the soles of the feet, then a second using the palms just before bed.\nOne study showed that placing hospital cold packs on glabrous skin‚Äîthe skin targeted by palm cooling‚Äîcooled overheated test subjects at nearly twice the rate of standard medical cooling methods. This trial included only 10 participants, however, and some other studies utilized similarly limited samples.\nHeller bemoans a lack of larger-sample research or even adoption of this approach in the medical world and several related settings‚Äìsuch as high school gyms, which contain defibrillators but nothing for rapid body cooling.\n‚ÄúHow many high school students have heart attacks? Not very many,‚Äù Heller says. ‚ÄúBut how many student athletes in high schools come down with heat illness, heat stroke, even heat death?‚Äù\nThere‚Äôs certainly skepticism to be found, including recent research suggesting limited or no benefit from palm cooling. Virtually everyone surveyed for this story agrees more direct and high-volume research is needed. The subjects are out there: From athletes across numerous sports to firefighters, from construction workers to medical patients and personnel. There are even larger populations available at mass participation events like outdoor ceremonies or large sporting events, where fans often experience heat stress or even heat stroke.\nMany of these sectors are already utilizing palm cooling. Apex estimates around 10 different fire departments nationwide use their Narwhals, and CoolMitt says they‚Äôve sold to 25 departments. CoolMitt provides products across several branches of the military (one Navy SEAL trainer even wrote a blog post highlighting CoolMitt‚Äôs benefits).\nEven skeptics would concede there are no known negative side effects or injury risks associated with palm cooling. In a world that‚Äôs only getting warmer, the space seems ripe for more exploration.\n‚ÄúI definitely think it can be revolutionary and change how we view working in hot environments,‚Äù Lantz says.",

Also being passed around, though, were handheld devices featuring a metal container and copper extensions, which several SC players held at each break. These thick black cylinders had small copper tubes coming out of their tops, tapered off to look almost like an oversized wine bottle being held by its neck.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">These are ‚Äúpalm-cooling‚Äù devices called <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.apexcoollabs.com/products/narwhals-palm-cooling-device\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.apexcoollabs.com/products/narwhals-palm-cooling-device\" href=\"https://www.apexcoollabs.com/products/narwhals-palm-cooling-device\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Narwhals</a>, so named for their visual similarity to the protruding tusks of narwhal whales.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nIf there‚Äôs one thing we at WIRED love almost as much as tech gear, it‚Äôs caffeine. Over the years, we‚Äôve naturally tracked down the best travel mugs through a series of unfortunate events: spilled lattes, lukewarm brews, and dented thermoses that saw better days. But those mishaps led us to our top picks, from spill-proof mugs that can survive the chaos of a NYC commute to self-heating tumblers for all-day sippers.\nI‚Äôve rounded up the best travel mugs that have earned their place in our cupboards. If you‚Äôre as obsessed with your morning brew as we are, be sure to check out our guides to the Best Coffee Subscriptions, Best Coffee Grinders, Best Espresso Machines, Best French Presses, Best Portable Coffee Makers, Best AeroPress Coffee Makers, and How to Make Better Coffee at Home.\nUpdated February 2025: I've added the Owala SmoothSip Slider and the Fellow Carter Move Mug. I've flagged picks that confirm lead use and added information on how we test. I also updated links and prices.\n|Next Up\n|I'll be testing the Snow Peak Milk Bottle for 350ml for $80 and the Kinto Travel Tumbler for $37.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nA Note on Lead Soldering\nSince we began testing reusable water bottles and travel mugs, we've discovered that some brands use lead soldering to seal their insulated bottles. While exposure is unlikely, we still believe it's an unnecessary risk, especially since many of our top choices use safer sealing methods. We've flagged any brands that confirmed lead use and will keep this list updated as we hear from others.\n- Stanley Cup\n- Contigo Luxe Autoseal\n- Yeti Rambler\n- OtterBox Elevation\nHow We Tested\nI‚Äôve been running on caffeine since I was 12 (sorry, Mom and Dad) because I took middle school way too seriously. Fourteen years later, caffeine is my personality at this point. So it's safe to say I‚Äôve been unofficially testing travel mugs for over a decade.\nFor this guide, I personally tested every mug on this list. I drank both coffee and tea at piping-hot and ice-cold extremes, rating heat retention and the taste, ensuring none had that metallic aftertaste. Shape and design matter, too: how comfortable it is to hold, whether it fits into a car cup holder, and if it offers additional features worth considering. I psychotically shook the mugs that promised to be leakproof and dropped those that claimed to be durable from about four feet onto both wood and concrete surfaces to evaluate how well they held up. Finally, travel mugs can be a pain to scrub, so I factored in how easy they were to clean.\nSimply put, I‚Äôm a lazy, highly caffeinated creature of convenience, and I need a travel mug that pulls its weight. If it didn't keep my coffee warm, my bag dry, and my life a little easier, it didn‚Äôt make the list.\nHonorable Mentions\nWe've run through many travel mugs, and not all of them are winners. These are a few we like, just not as much as the ones above.\nKeepCup 12oz Coffee Cup for $28: This double-walled, insulated mug is meant to replicate (and replace) paper coffee shop cups. This is a solid option if you're looking for a glass cup (the rubber grip is plastic, though). That said, it‚Äôs not the best for preserving your coffee's temperature, and the lid is a tad wobbly.\nOxo Good Grips Thermal Mug for $33: We reviewed this bottle in 2022 and appreciated its sturdy build and dishwasher-friendliness, but since it's older it now fluctuates in and out of stock.\nREI Co-op Camp Mug for $16: REI's stainless steel cup is a decent mug that doesn't particularly stand out. Giordano says the exterior coating was tough enough to show no scratches, even after knocking it over a few times outside.\nZojirushi Stainless Steel Mug for $22: The lid locks to avoid accidental spillage, and editor Adrienne So once left tea in it for 18 hours (unintentionally) and discovered it was still hot when she opened it. The downside is that the cover has three separate parts‚Äîa mouthpiece, a gasket, and a lid‚Äîthat are deeply ridged and annoying to clean.\nAvoid These Travel Mugs\nThey can't all be winners. As mentioned above, we excluded brands that use lead. These are two additional cups that just fell short in comparison to our favorites.\nGreens Steel Beast 20-Ounce Insulated Tumbler for $21: The Beast Tumbler has over 78,000 positive reviews on Amazon, but we found the rubber seal around the lid easily comes out of place. That meant it leaked like a sieve.\nToaks Titanium Double Wall 450ML Cup for $40: More often than not, we champion Toaks gear as an affordable source of titanium camp cookware. But this mug is $12 more than the Hydro Flask mug we recommend above, and its finishing is rougher.",

    "content_text": "Ashley Poprik has never been the model for a video game character. As a writer on projects like Spider-Man 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, they work on games, not as characters within them. In 2023, however, a cabal of angry gamers was convinced otherwise. They were furious over how Spider-Man 2‚Äôs Mary Jane looked; more specifically, they complained, she simply wasn‚Äôt hot enough.\nThe problem, these gamers falsely claimed, was that Poprik‚Äîthen a writing intern with no ability to change a character‚Äôs face, let alone one based on a real-life model‚Äîhad inserted themself into the game. Gamers concocted this conspiracy based on a photo of the writer, placed side-by-side with Mary Jane; in the photo, Poprik and MJ both sport long hair with a middle part, are smiling, and have a similar face shape.\nPoprik, who identifies as gender-fluid, describes themself as having androgynous features. ‚ÄúA big narrative spun up that I was a trans woman, and so I was getting hate from any alt-right winger,‚Äù they say.\n‚ÄúI was getting so many death threats, pictures of decapitated women, and YouTube videos about me that were just straight made-up information,‚Äù Poprik says. ‚ÄúIt forever changed the way I feel about video games.‚Äù\nEventually, things got so bad that Poprik had to wipe personal information from the internet out of fear for their safety.\nPoprik has faced months of ongoing online harassment as well as in-person accusations of making things ‚Äúwoke‚Äù‚Äîespecially for features within the games they had no involvement in. Yet in each case, Poprik says, they received no support or security resources from the companies they worked for.\n‚ÄúWhen a marginalized dev is harassed, they‚Äôre on their own,‚Äù Poprik says.\nToday, being anything other than a cisgender game developer in the United States is more dangerous than ever. Online, transgender and gender-nonconforming developers become harassment targets at the whims of reactionary grifters railing against anything socially progressive or the result of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Offline, President Donald Trump seeks to deny their existence with executive orders aimed at ‚Äúrestoring biological truth to the federal government,‚Äù restricting lifesaving health care for minors, and removing trans people from the military.\nOther executive orders, though, pose a more imminent threat. Trump‚Äôs move to eliminate government funding for programs that battle discriminatory practices are already being mimicked by tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon. Developers fear their own employers could follow suit. Given that so much of what‚Äôs come to be known as ‚ÄúGamergate 2.0‚Äù has focused on gamers railing against real or perceived DEI efforts, these worries don‚Äôt seem unfounded.\nWIRED spoke with seven developers across the industry in workplaces ranging from AAA studios to small, independent companies. Many spoke to us only under the condition of anonymity out of concern for their safety or because they did not have permission to speak to the press on behalf of their companies. (WIRED independently confirmed all their identities and employment.) What emerged was a consistent narrative of fear, stress, and alienation that follows them into the workplace and is thriving in the online culture surrounding video games.\nAs Poprik notes, ‚Äúbeing a queer person in games can feel really lonely.‚Äù Very few people seem to reach out to their affected colleagues, they add, and ‚Äúsometimes it feels like the lack of any sort of support means they‚Äôre happy with the state of things right now.‚Äù\nEllen, a trans developer working in AAA games, says the thought of rolling back DEI initiatives in the games industry is particularly disconcerting because, while these programs offer support to employees, they also positively impact the larger games culture by fostering an industry that produces titles that speak to and welcome a larger group of players. (Ellen is a pseudonym.)\n‚ÄúAt the corporate level, you're making a case why it's good business,‚Äù Ellen says. ‚ÄúBut on a personal level you're trying to make sure your community has a space carved out in the company, and your fans have a space carved out in your games.‚Äù\nLike the other developers WIRED spoke to, Ellen describes daily stress that bleeds over into her work. ‚ÄúThe news comes like an assault,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúTimes like this just enforce that it's important to keep going, that art like only trans people could make needs to exist in the world more.‚Äù\nEven as she wonders if she should leave the US altogether, Ellen is fearful of traveling within the country as well, given that protections for trans people vary by state. Laws related to even the basic ability to use the bathroom according to a person‚Äôs gender identity shift from place to place, and Trump‚Äôs recent moves are further complicating such matters.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former game developer who wants to talk about work conditions, DEI rollbacks, or anything else related to game development? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at meganfarokhmanesh.76.\nReturn-to-office policies in the games space, for example, are removing developers‚Äô ability to work remotely‚Äîincluding in states where they may feel safer. Developers who travel internationally for work could also be at risk of losing their passports. The State Department, following the president‚Äôs executive order on ‚Äúgender ideology,‚Äù is no longer issuing documents with ‚ÄúX‚Äù gender markers, and has begun confiscating passports and related documents indefinitely when people attempt to renew theirs.\nProfessionally, this spells trouble for affected developers. Many gaming events take place across the US, from Los Angeles to Boston. These gatherings are business opportunities for game developers, where they can network, learn from peers, scout new jobs, find funding, or show their games. Next month, thousands in the gaming industry will gather in San Francisco for the annual Game Developers Conference. But some developers will be forgoing the show out of concern for their safety.\n‚ÄúI'm concerned I'm going to get trapped in the US,‚Äù an American developer based in Canada tells WIRED. It‚Äôs also unclear if they‚Äôll even be able to enter the States with their current passport. ‚ÄúNo way I'm going to risk it.‚Äù\nThe video game industry has a poor history of standing up to targeted harassment. It‚Äôs only in the past few years that companies have begun instituting policies and taking serious action against abusive individuals. Developers themselves have complained that their companies are not doing enough to weed out harassment online. More than a decade later, the impact of Gamergate remains as a playbook for mob-driven harassment, and the communities to utilize it.\nThree developers WIRED spoke to pointed to the events of Gamergate‚Äîa large-scale misogynistic and transphobic harassment campaign by online trolls in 2014 that profoundly affected all of gaming culture‚Äîas a sort of canary in the coal mine.\n‚ÄúEven before the bathroom bills, around the time of the first Gamergate, you could see people getting more and more bold with their anti-trans beliefs and folks just brushing it off as a ‚Äòjoke,‚Äô‚Äù says one developer. ‚ÄúBut then jokes became memes, and memes became popular, and then an entire culture of spreading anti-trans hate became acceptable and something we are supposed to tolerate.‚Äù\nOver the past year, anti-DEI efforts intensified in gaming communities as people blamed perceived flaws and flops on diversity efforts, while ignoring the macro factors of a struggling industry. Conservative circles targeted small companies and consultants they perceived as having influence on progressive values in video games. They went after anything they considered antithetical to games they wanted made‚Äîstories without minorities or queer characters, fictional women they think are attractive, and narratives bereft of what they view as leftist political agendas. Similar anti-DEI sentiments have since ripped through the tech industry and expanded nationally.\nThe trans community in games has felt these attacks acutely. Controversies around inclusion on something as small as optional top surgery scars in a character creator made developers targets. ‚ÄúIt's felt like a slow creeping horror of watching right-wing party after right-wing party realize we're a softer target than the rest of the LGB community,‚Äù one developer says.\nMany developers feel frustration that the gaming industry overall has remained silent so as to not alienate an imagined audience. ‚ÄúIt signals to players and their own workers that the company lacks a spine in standing up for their work, while signaling internally that the bottom line will always be dollars,‚Äù says another developer. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt piss off the bigots, because they spend money.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs even more disheartening for trans, genderqueer, and nonbinary developers who work at the very companies that won‚Äôt publicly defend them. ‚ÄúI know there's a lot of the rainbow capitalism, ‚ÄòHey, we're all in it together. Look at all these flags we're waving,‚Äô‚Äù says Dax, a trans developer at a AAA studio. (Dax is a pseudonym.) ‚ÄúBut in the end, it's a company making money. They want to appeal to as many people as possible.‚Äù\nEven among progressive colleagues, Dax feels disappointed in what she feels are empty platitudes: apologies with no action, or sentiments that appear to be empathetic of her experience, but reinforce the idea that she‚Äôs suffering alone. ‚ÄúI remember being a cis white man, and I was scared of saying anything, or doing anything,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄùI wanted to stay in my lane and not bother anybody, and that's what they're doing. The second I transitioned, I was treated differently in the industry, overall.‚Äù\nOver the course of reporting this story, WIRED reached out to companies that have previously participated in corporate pride events or included trans or nonbinary characters in their games, including representatives at companies such as PlayStation, Xbox, Riot Games, and Activision Blizzard, and asked about supporting their employees. Only one company replied: Devolver Digital. In a statement, the indie publisher said that it respects the rights of all individuals and does not tolerate discrimination, victimization, or harassment based on a person‚Äôs race, sex, gender identity, or gender expression. The company added that it will continue to support its colleagues by ensuring their voices are heard.\nThe developers WIRED spoke to are asking for more from the places that employ them, the people they work with, and the players that enjoy their games. ‚ÄúWe should be out there being shown off,‚Äù Dax says. Companies should not shy away from hiring or representing queer communities in their games, many of the developers tell WIRED, and they want to see company DEI initiatives highlighted, rather than hidden away.\nThe industry is already bleeding talent through mass layoffs; refusal to support its own employees may push many more out the door. Even before the current administration, trans and gender-nonconforming developers faced discrimination. ‚ÄúI went from being trusted with my knowledge to being questioned,‚Äù Dax says of her transition. ‚ÄúThey suddenly are not giving me the same respect or understanding.‚Äù\nDax says that some people are casting blame on the trans community and its current predicament for being ‚Äúso out and proud.‚Äù She disagrees with that idea. ‚ÄúI want to see [companies] take bold choices and stand with us instead of cowering, wanting to appease this very loud, very small group of people who just can't stop slurring and screaming and being unreasonably hateful. By saying nothing, they're siding with hate.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "I‚Äôm on an overnight flight from New York to Frankfurt, Germany, and the accoutrements given to me in business class have a sustainable sheen. Both the polyester blanket and polyester flight kit proudly claim they are made of fabric spun from recycled plastic bottles.\nBut doesn‚Äôt United Airlines know that recycled bottles are so yesterday‚Äôs green material? No, the new hot and hyped technology is recycling polyester into polyester. And I‚Äôm on my way to observe the most well-capitalized innovation in this burgeoning field, a chemical recycling process by a new startup, Reju.\nOnly a half hour outside downtown Frankfurt at a drab industrial park are Reju‚Äôs temporary office and three half-constructed buildings that will serve as its industrial operations. In the middle will be R&D and education, to the right is the depolymerization plant, and to the left will be the repolymerization plant.\nPlastics, including polyester, are formed by taking individual chemicals called monomers and forming them into chains to create polymers. Essentially, Reju‚Äôs process breaks the polyester down into its constituent chemicals (depolymerization) then puts it back together in a chain again (repolymerization).\nI suit up in a hard hat, vest, safety glasses, and sneakers, along with a half dozen other journalists and influencers to see inside the depolymerization plant, where the magic happens. (Reju hosted me on this trip and covered my travel costs.) Silver pipes snake everywhere into small silos, and from our vantage point on the ground floor, we can look up through the metal grates and through the guts of panels and ducts to the top of the four-story building. Men in jeans and high-visibility vests wander the plant, casually tinkering with the settings on various pieces of machinery, calling in German to each other.\nAs I‚Äôve reported before, the fashion industry is dissatisfied with the current polyester recycling paradigm. Just 0.3 percent of materials used in fashion are from recycled sources, and of that, it's pretty much all water bottles.\nYou see, polyester is the exact same as PET plastic used in water bottles, just in a different shape (threads instead of a bottle). Mechanically recycling PET‚Äîmelting it down and re-extruding it‚Äîisn‚Äôt ideal, because the process degrades the quality of the plastic, making it less pliable and high-performance. It also requires pure, undyed PET, with the clear plastic bottle being the paragon. And polyester textiles are never pure polyester.\nThe most common mix of materials you‚Äôll find in old clothing is 70 percent polyester, 30 percent cotton. ‚ÄúBut when you go into the details, it‚Äôs actually 60 percent PET, 5 percent dyes, 2 percent elastane, maybe contains a little bit of nylon. Who knows?‚Äú says Antoni Mairata, the chief technology officer at Reju, as he prepares us to walk through the factory.\nMy previous reporting has shown that polyester can also contain plasticizers like BPA, metals such as antimony, toxic PFAS, and more undesirable contaminants it picked up as it moved across the world through factories, warehouses, and container ships. This is why we feed millions of clear, food-grade water bottles into recycling plants, while dumping old polyester clothing into landfills.\nSo the hunt is on for a technology that can recycle dirty polyester fabric into clean polyester fabric. And that‚Äôs where chemical recycling comes in. ‚ÄúThis is a chemical plant,‚Äù says Mairata. ‚ÄúIt has nothing to do with any mechanical recycling plant that you might have seen.‚Äù Reju‚Äôs chemical recycling process strips out contaminants and yields a pure monomer. ‚ÄúWhat you get out is better than what you had before. That's what is meant by ‚Äòupcycling,‚Äô‚Äù Mairata says.\nThe old polyester comes to Reju as multicolored shredded fiber. It‚Äôs purified through an extraction process, which takes out the cotton and other contaminants. (In Reju's offices, we were shown popcorn-like nuggets of PET, but Reju says in the actual process, it will yield a powdered PET.) That is then emptied at the top of the building into an extruder, which melts it all down. That honey-like liquid is poured into a reactor designed by Reju. In a series of metal boxes, it meets ethylene glycol to break the chemical bonds, with the help of a catalyst.\nWhat comes out is the monomer BHET in the form of white powder. That is then sent over to the other building to be repolymerized, and voil√†: You have pure recycled PET pellets, which can be shipped to a mill to be melted and extruded into polyester threads.\nThe catalyst is the secret sauce. Most chemical recycling requires super high temperatures and a lot of energy, which can cancel out the environmental benefits of recycling the polyester. But this catalyst has a boiling point at least 50 degrees Celsius lower than ethylene glycol's boiling point. Lower temperatures translate to lower energy requirements. The ethylene glycol is consumed, while the catalyst can be recycled back through the reactor again and again, for a closed-loop process. Reju's recycling system isn't zero-waste‚Äîit uses some energy and resources‚Äîbut the company claims its recycled polyester production process emits half the greenhouse gases of virgin polyester production.\nIt also doesn‚Äôt create a waste byproduct, save for the dyes and finishes that came with the used polyester. (Reju is hoping to find a company that can take those waste products and make something valuable out of them, or else it will be stuck dealing with all that hazardous contaminant waste itself, including any PFAS or plasticizers. Bummer.)\n‚ÄúThe fact that it's the fastest, it uses the least amount of energy, and has the highest yield, are the things that actually makes it possible to industrialize this,‚Äù Reju CEO Patrik Frisk says.\nReju says the catalyst is proprietary, but the patent by IBM, which discovered the process and has licensed it to Reju, indicates that it‚Äôs triethylamine, a flammable chemical commonly used as a catalyst in manufacturing resins. While it needs to be handled carefully in the factory, it degrades quickly and therefore doesn‚Äôt pose a risk of long term contamination or damage to humans or the environment.\nAnother benefit over mechanical recycling, which relies on plastic bottles and degrades the PET each go-round, is that this process can be repeated indefinitely without degrading the quality of the resulting polyester. Sounds pretty perfect. So what‚Äôs the catch?\nA PET Project\nThe four-story building we‚Äôre touring is just a demo plant, a proof that the technology works and a place to refine it before scaling it up. The eventual industrial plant, which Reju aims to build by 2027, will have 50 times the capacity of this building.\nThat sounds impressive when compared to the typical sustainable material startup. But it‚Äôs just one project in a portfolio of ‚Äúsustainable chemistry‚Äù projects by its mother company, Technip Energies, a 16,000-person French company that was spun off from a more traditional French engineering and construction firm, TechnipFMG, in 2021.\nTechnip Energies focuses on what it calls ‚Äúenergy transition‚Äù projects, like with Lanzatech on the Gulf Coast to decarbonize ethylene production, which got $200 million in funding from the US Department of Energy in 2024. There‚Äôs a UK carbon capture project with Shell, and an offshore wind joint venture with SBM Offshore. But most of Technip Energy‚Äôs revenue comes from liquified natural gas (LNG), ethylene, and hydrogen. It provides the engineering and technology expertise to build out petrochemical infrastructure such as offshore LNG storage and cracking plants, which turn fossil fuels into the ingredients for plastic.\nT.EN Zimmer, a Frankfurt-based company founded in 1956 that Technip bought in 2015, is in the similar business of constructing polyester and nylon factories, and its technology is in over 1,000 polymer plants around the world, making up about 30 percent of the market, according to Frisk.\nThat accounts for Reju‚Äôs swagger, walking into the nascent polyester recycling industry like a kid walking into the schoolyard with his big brother right behind him, and a very imposing father taking up the rear. Polyester chemical recycling startups like Circ and Carbios have had to scrape together funding to take a promising technology from the lab to pilot plants and then demo plants, and that journey can take 10 years or more, if it happens at all.\nCarbios announced in December it was pausing construction of its demo plant. Renewcell, a promising cotton recycling technology backed by the clothing brand H&M, declared bankruptcy only one year after it opened its commercial plant in Sweden. Fashion brands weren‚Äôt interested in buying its pricier product, even with its sustainability bonafides.\nMeanwhile, Reju, which has the polyester engineering prowess of T.EN Zimmer and the $4.7 billion market cap of Technip Energies behind it, ‚Äúbuilt a 1,000-ton demo plant in less than a year,‚Äù Frisk says. ‚ÄúThat's unheard of.‚Äù\nReju is attempting to market its purified polyester to brands, who will then direct their favored polyester mills to purchase the recycled PET pellets. Reju wouldn‚Äôt say exactly how much more expensive its product is than virgin polyester, or even mechanically recycled polyester from bottles. But it definitely is. Its value proposition is that, with access to a stable of about 100 top-tier polymer engineers, it will produce the highest-quality and highest-performance polyester on the market, which also happens to be recycled.\n‚ÄúWe actually have an opportunity for the brands to make a better product, which I believe is something that's important,‚Äù Frisk says. ‚ÄúBecause we all know that the consumer is not really willing to pay for green ‚Ä¶ but they're willing to pay for a better product.‚Äù\nWell, kind of. Some polyester, like the kind Nike and Patagonia source, has all the gee-whiz branding and is priced accordingly. But the fashion industry is notoriously price sensitive, and a lot of polyester, like the kind you‚Äôll find in Shein crop tops, is the cheapest fabric available. Reju‚Äôs sustainable, high-tech product isn‚Äôt going to appeal to the ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find the cheapest option on Amazon‚Äù crowd. And ostensibly, that is where our overproduction crisis really lies.\nA Flood of Polyester\nThere‚Äôs one huge piece of the puzzle that is currently outside Reju‚Äôs control: finding affordable feedstock.\nYou would think that would be easy. According to a 2024 study, 28 percent of post-consumer garments in the US were primarily polyester. And currently, those used polyester garments are not exactly a hot commodity. They‚Äôre either landfilled, burned, downcycled into things like moving blankets and car insulation, or shipped abroad to developing countries for pennies per pound. There, some are sold, but more are landfilled, burned, and tossed into waterways or into the desert.\nSounds like free feedstock, right? Wrong. Currently, used clothing is hand-sorted by humans, a laborious and expensive process that pushes the cost of used clothing, even if it‚Äôs donated, over the cost of brand-new ultra-fast fashion. That has led to a slow-moving crisis in the secondhand apparel industry. In October, Soex Group, the largest global collector of used clothing and textiles, began insolvency proceedings.\nSo before Reju can ink deals with brands, it needs to know that the infrastructure is in place to cheaply and efficiently aggregate, sort, and prepare waste polyester for its recycling process. ‚ÄúWith only this technology alone, you're not going anywhere,‚Äù Mairata says. ‚ÄúThere's no company that can actually handle this complexity.‚Äù (He means the logistics of sourcing used polyester clothing while also recycling it.) ‚ÄúSo you should partner up.‚Äù\nEurope is somewhat ahead in this regard. By this year, European Union member states are required to establish publicly funded, separate collection sites for textiles so they don‚Äôt end up in household waste. The worry of many is that all those collected textiles will either be sent to incinerators or dumped on‚Äîer, shipped abroad to‚Äîdeveloping countries, who are already up to their necks in old clothing waste. Reju is positioning itself as a better solution, and it has partnered with Nouvelles Fibres Textiles, a French company that deploys new technologies to automatically sort clothing by type and color, and remove hard points like zippers and buttons.\nReju also recently signed a deal with Cibutex, a Dutch consortium of five companies that provide linen and laundry services to health care and hospitality companies. That way it will have access to large amounts of fairly homogenous, used polyester textiles.\nIn the US, Reju announced a partnership with Goodwill and Waste Management in October, to figure out the basics of building a reliable supply chain. How will the old clothing be collected? Will it be separated from donations or collected curbside with other recyclables? Maybe both? How can the polyester be separated quickly and automatically, then stripped of buttons, zippers, and other doodads so it can be chopped up and prepared for chemical recycling? That all remains to be worked out.\nFollow the Money\nReju is a departure for both T.EN Zimmer and Technip. Normally, Technip would just license the technology from IBM and T.EN Zimmer would offer it to its customers as one in a menu of options. Instead, Technip decided to start a new company that would produce the recycled PET itself.\nThe question that comes to mind is, why? Why would a fossil-fuel-dependent engineering company decide to get into the chemical recycling business?\nReju‚Äôs CEO, Patrik Frisk, who before this was CEO at Under Armour and Aldo, will tell you that it‚Äôs about addressing a polyester crisis. Global polyester production rose from 63 million metric tons in 2022 to 71 million in 2023, and none of that is getting recycled. ‚ÄúIt's terrifying, but we've also got to realize that we created it, right? So we should be able to fix it somehow, or at least find a way to make sure that there is an alternative.‚Äù\nWhether you believe that depends on how cynical you‚Äôre feeling. (These days? Very.) It could be that this technology can find success and start to make up for the fossil-fuel sins of Technip‚Äôs past. Or, like the pledges that were taken up and then quietly dropped by fashion brands and consumer product brands, it could be a pretty little distraction from the oncoming tidal wave of plastic everything.\nAfter all, rising plastic demand, including for polyester, has fueled a boom in cracking plant construction‚Äîyes, the exact kind that Technip helps build.\nAt the time of my trip in November, the international plastic treaty negotiations were still a few weeks away from stalling out. The so-called ‚Äúhigh-ambition‚Äù countries such as the UK, Canada, and many African, European, Latin American, and Pacific countries want to tackle plastics at their source, by reducing overall plastic production. The oil-producing countries want to categorize this proliferation of plastic as a waste management problem and let the growth of PET and other plastics continue unfettered‚Äîas long as there‚Äôs an interest in collecting and recycling them. (Whether that actually happens, well, that‚Äôs another story.)\nIf I had to take a guess, I would say this polyester recycling technology falls under the ‚Äúwaste management‚Äù rubric. Let the PET plastic factories, TE.N Zimmer‚Äôs clients included, do their thing. We‚Äôll see if we can clean some of that mess up later.\nAs a sustainability journalist, I live a pretty spare lifestyle. I don‚Äôt feel great about jetting off to Mexico on a whim like many of my friends, nor could I afford it. I spend probably too much money on natural-fiber clothing. I thought long and hard about whether to fly to Germany for two days to see the plastics recycling plant. My nerdy curiosity won out.\nBut the week I visited Reju‚Äôs chemical recycling plant, I got a small taste of a different world. As I was ferried from the airport to the high-end hotel and back again in a BMW sedan, and settled into my capacious business class seat, I was acutely aware that all this abundance flows from fossil fuels. There‚Äôs the jet fuel and gasoline powering my comfortable rides, which are in turn funded by an energy conglomerate eager to show me its sustainable project.\nComplicity in climate change, I mused, comes in many shades, but it is usually easy and comfortable. As easy and comfortable as one-click-buying a cheap and fluffy polyester blanket‚Äìeven if you know it will eventually end up in the garbage.\nUpdate, February 24 at 4:30 pm: This story was updated to correct some details how the PET purification process is described, and also to clarify that the resulting powdered monomer is BHET.",

No, the new hot and hyped technology is recycling <em>polyester</em> into polyester.

(Reju hosted me on this trip and covered my travel costs.) Silver pipes snake everywhere into small silos, and from our vantage point on the ground floor, we can look up through the metal grates and through the guts of panels and ducts to the top of the four-story building. Men in jeans and high-visibility vests wander the plant, casually tinkering with the settings on various pieces of machinery, calling in German to each other.</p><p class=\"paywall\">As I‚Äôve reported before, the fashion industry <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/polyester-recycling/\">is dissatisfied</a> with the current polyester recycling paradigm. <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.circle-economy.com/news/just-0-3-of-materials-used-by-the-global-textile-industry-come-from-recycled-sources-with-almost-no-textile-to-textile-recycling\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.circle-economy.com/news/just-0-3-of-materials-used-by-the-global-textile-industry-come-from-recycled-sources-with-almost-no-textile-to-textile-recycling\" href=\"https://www.circle-economy.com/news/just-0-3-of-materials-used-by-the-global-textile-industry-come-from-recycled-sources-with-almost-no-textile-to-textile-recycling\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Just 0.3 percent of materials used in fashion are from recycled sources</a>, and of that, it's pretty much all water bottles.</p><p class=\"paywall\">You see, polyester is the exact same as PET plastic used in water bottles, just in a different shape (threads instead of a bottle). Mechanically recycling PET‚Äîmelting it down and re-extruding it‚Äîisn‚Äôt ideal, because the process degrades the quality of the plastic, making it less pliable and high-performance. It also requires pure, undyed PET, with the clear plastic bottle being the paragon. And polyester textiles are never pure polyester.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The most common mix of materials you‚Äôll find in old clothing is 70 percent polyester, 30 percent cotton. ‚ÄúBut when you go into the details, it‚Äôs actually 60 percent PET, 5 percent dyes, 2 percent elastane, maybe contains a little bit of nylon.

This is why we feed millions of clear, food-grade water bottles into recycling plants, while dumping old polyester clothing into landfills.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "This month, Andrew Bernier, a US Army Corps of Engineers researcher and a union leader, says that he has received a barrage of menacing messages from the same anonymous email account. Unfolding like short chapters in a dystopian novel, they have spoken of the genius of Elon Musk, referenced the power of the billionaire‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and foretold the downfall of ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù union bosses.\nBut the most eerie thing about the emails, which Bernier says began arriving after he filed an official charge accusing the Trump administration of violating his union‚Äôs collective bargaining agreement, is that they included personal details about his life‚Äîsome of which he believes might have come from surveillance of his work laptop. The author referenced Bernier‚Äôs union activities, nickname, job, travel details, and even the green notebook he regularly uses. The most recent email implied that his computer was loaded with spyware. ‚ÄúAndy's crusade, like so many before it, had been doomed from the start,‚Äù one email stated. ‚ÄúThe real tragedy wasn't his failure‚Äîit was his belief that the fight had ever been real.‚Äù\nThe unsettling messages, which were reviewed by WIRED, are an extreme example of the kinds of encounters that workers across the US government say they have had with technology since President Donald Trump took office. WIRED spoke to current employees at 13 federal agencies for this story who expressed fears about potentially being monitored by software programs, some of which they described as unfamiliar. Others said that routine software updates and notifications, perhaps once readily glossed over, have taken on ominous new meanings. Several reported feeling anxious and hyperaware of the devices and technology around them.\nAt the General Services Administration (GSA), one worker cited a Chrome browser extension called Dynatrace, an existing program for monitoring app performance. Inside the Social Security Administration, another employee pointed to Splunk, a long-standing tool that‚Äôs used to alert IT staff to security anomalies like when an unauthorized USB drive is plugged into a laptop. At the US Agency for International Development, one worker was caught off guard by Google‚Äôs Gemini AI chatbot, installations of which kicked off days before Trump took office.\n‚ÄúEveryone has been talking about whether our laptops are now able to listen to our conversations and track what we do,‚Äù says a current GSA employee, who like other workers in this story was granted anonymity because they didn‚Äôt have authorization to speak and feared retaliation.\nDynatrace and Splunk did not respond to requests for comment from WIRED.\nThe workers‚Äô accounts come as Musk‚Äôs DOGE organization is rapidly burrowing into various government agencies and departments, often gaining access to personnel records, logs of financial transactions, and other sensitive information in the process. The efforts are part of the Trump administration‚Äôs broader plan to terminate thousands of government employees and remake the face of federal agencies.\nLike many private companies, US federal agencies disclose to staff that they have tools to monitor what workers do on their computers and networks. The US government‚Äôs capabilities in this area have also expanded over the past decade.\nIt couldn‚Äôt be learned whether the Trump administration has begun using existing tools to monitor employees in new ways; multiple agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the General Services Administration, denied that they have. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Public evidence has not emerged of new government purchases of user-monitoring software, which is generally needed for detailed surveillance such as tracking which files a worker has copied onto a thumb drive. Some of the updates and changes that have been noticed by federal workers date back to software purchases and plans enacted long before Trump was in power, WIRED reporting shows.\n‚ÄúI will say my concerns are primarily based in general fear as opposed to specific knowledge,‚Äù says a worker at the Department of Homeland Security, who adds: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to be told I‚Äôm wrong.‚Äù\nBut activity that some workers perceive as signs of increased surveillance has prompted them to take precautions. Bernier, who works as a civil engineer for the Army Corps based in Hanover, New Hampshire, says the messages he received spooked him enough that he asked local police to keep an eye on his home, removed the battery from his work-issued laptop, and kept his work phone on airplane mode while traveling to a nonwork conference last week. ‚ÄúThere are things I don‚Äôt control but actions I can take to protect myself and my family,‚Äù he says.\nBernier‚Äôs anonymous emailer and the Army Corps did not respond to requests for comment.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at peard33.24, dell.3030, and alexadobrien.357.\nA person inside the Environmental Protection Agency told WIRED last week that they‚Äôve witnessed coworkers back out of Microsoft Teams meetings, which can be easily recorded and automatically transcribed, when they are related to topics they believe could get them fired. ‚ÄúDefinite chilling effect,‚Äù the person says. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.\nAn employee at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whose work with international partners is being audited by DOGE operatives, says they and their colleagues began avoiding messaging one another and have ‚Äúreally cut down on putting things in writing‚Äù in recent weeks. They report that correspondence from their supervisors has also significantly dropped off. The NOAA declined to comment.\nAt the Federal Bureau of Investigation, anxiety around officials possibly targeting officers and activities perceived as being disloyal to the president has cratered morale, a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the agents' concerns tells WIRED. The FBI declined to comment.\nAryani Ong, a civil rights activist and cofounder of Asian American Federal Employees for Nondiscrimination, a group that advocates for government workers, says those she‚Äôs been in contact with are in a heightened state of alert. In response, some federal employees have turned to encrypted communications apps to connect with colleagues and taken steps to anonymize their social media accounts, Ong says. (Federal workers are granted an allowance to use nonofficial communication tools only ‚Äúin exceptional circumstances.‚Äù)\nInsider Threat\nLong before Trump‚Äôs inauguration, user activity monitoring was already mandated for federal agencies and networks that handle classified information‚Äîthe result of an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in the wake of a massive breach of classified diplomatic cables and information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2010. The capability is part of government-wide insider-threat programs that greatly expanded after Edward Snowden‚Äôs leak of classified surveillance documents in 2013 and again after an Army specialist murdered three colleagues and injured 16 others at Fort Hood in 2014.\nThe US government‚Äôs current approach to digitally monitoring federal workers has largely been guided by a directive issued by the Committee on National Security Systems in 2014, which orders relevant agencies to tie user activity to ‚Äúspecific users.‚Äù The public portions of the document call for ‚Äúevery executive branch department and agency‚Äù handling classified information to have capabilities to take screenshots, capture keystrokes, and intercept chats and email on employee devices. They are also instructed to deploy ‚Äúfile shadowing,‚Äù meaning secretly producing facsimiles of every file a user edits or opens.\nThe insider threat programs at departments such as Health and Human Services, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs, also have policies that protect unclassified government information, which enable them to monitor employees‚Äô clicks and communications, according to notices in the Federal Register, an official source of rulemaking documents. Policies for the Department of the Interior, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporate, also allow collecting and assessing employees‚Äô social media content.\nThese internal agency programs, overseen by a national task force led by the attorney general and director of national intelligence, aim to identify behaviors that may indicate the heightened risk of not only leaks and workplace violence, but also the ‚Äúloss‚Äù or \"degradation\" of a federal agency‚Äôs ‚Äúresources or capabilities.‚Äù Over 60 percent of insider-threat incidents in the federal sector involve fraud, such as stealing money or taking someone's personal information, and are non-espionage related, according to analysis by Carnegie Mellon researchers.\n‚ÄúFraud,‚Äù ‚Äúdisgruntlement,‚Äù ‚Äúideological challenges,‚Äù ‚Äúmoral outrage,‚Äù or discussion of moral concerns deemed ‚Äúunrelated to work duties‚Äù are some of the possible signs that a worker poses a threat, according to US government training literature.\nOf the 15 Cabinet-level departments such as energy, labor, and veterans affairs, at least nine had contracts as of late last year with suppliers such as Everfox and Dtex Systems that allowed for digitally monitoring of a portion of employees, according to public spending data. Everfox declined to comment.\nDtex‚Äôs Intercept software, which is used by multiple federal agencies, is one example of a newer class of programs that generate individual risk scores by analyzing anonymized metadata, such as which URLs workers are visiting and which files they‚Äôre opening and printing out on their work devices, according to the company. When an agency wants to identify and further investigate someone with a high score, two people have to sign off in some versions of its tool, according to the company. Dtex‚Äôs software doesn‚Äôt have to log keystrokes or scan the content of emails, calls, chats, or social media posts.\nBut that isn't how things work broadly across the government, where employees are warned explicitly in a recurring message when they boot up their devices that they have \"no reasonable expectation of privacy\" in their communications or in any data stored or transmitted through government networks. The question remains if and to what extent DOGE‚Äôs operatives are relying on existing monitoring programs to carry out Trump‚Äôs mission to rapidly eliminate federal workers that his administration views as unaligned with the president‚Äôs agenda or disloyal.\nRajan Koo, the chief technology officer of Dtex tells WIRED that he hopes the Trump administration will adjust the government‚Äôs approach to monitoring. Events such as widespread layoffs coupled with a reliance on what Koo described as intrusive surveillance tools can stir up an environment in which workers feel disgruntled, he says. ‚ÄúYou can create a culture of reciprocal loyalty,‚Äù says Koo, or ‚Äúthe perfect breeding ground for insider threats.‚Äù\nAlready Overwhelmed\nSources with knowledge of the US government‚Äôs insider-threat programs describe them as largely inefficient and labor intensive, requiring overstretched teams of analysts to manually pore through daily barrages of alerts that include many false positives. Multiple sources said that the systems are currently ‚Äúoverwhelmed.‚Äù Any effort by the Trump administration to extend the reach of such tools or widen their parameters‚Äîto more closely surveil for perceived signs of insubordination or disloyalty to partisan fealties, for instance‚Äîlikely would result in a significant spike in false positives that would take considerable time to comb through, according to the people familiar with the work.\nIn an email last month seeking federal employees‚Äô voluntary resignations, the Trump administration wrote that it wanted a ‚Äúreliable, loyal, trustworthy‚Äù workforce. Attempts to use insider-threat programs to enforce that vision could be met by a number of legal challenges.\nUS intelligence community analysts are required by law and directive to provide unbiased and objective work. That means avoiding cherry-picking information to deliberately alter judgements or falling prey to outside pressure, including from personal or political biases. These standards, even when not officially codified, are core to the professional ethics of any intelligence practitioner or law enforcement analyst conducting assessments of insider threats.\nA 2018 national insider-threat task force framework notes that federal programs should comply with ‚Äúall applicable legal, privacy and civil liberties rights, and whistleblower protections.‚Äù Bradley Moss, an attorney representing US intelligence and law enforcement personnel, says that \"disloyalty\" to the Trump administration is ‚Äútoo vague‚Äù an excuse to terminate employees with civil service protections, adding that if \"they're going to go through the statutory process, they need to demonstrate actual cause for termination.\"\nA federal law enforcement source warns that monitoring could theoretically be used to gather political intelligence on federal employees, while the administration looks for more palatable reasons to terminate them later; similar to how law enforcement may obtain evidence that's inadmissible in the course of a criminal investigation, but then search for another evidentiary basis to file charges.\nJoe Spielberger, senior legal counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan group fighting alleged corruption, says that if Musk were serious about cutting government waste, he would be strengthening protections for people who report corruption and mismanagement.

    "content_text": "I know this is unconventional, but I‚Äôm going to start by telling you the ending. Or at least, the ending as it stands today. Most of the people involved in this story wind up either dead, maimed, spending months in a mental hospital, languishing in jail, or gone underground. It's a tragedy from almost any angle, especially because, at the outset, most of these people were idealists committed to doing as much good as possible in a world they saw as beset by existential threats. In spite of those aims, or perhaps in pursuit of them, over the course of this story their lives will devolve into senseless violence. And by the time we reach the present, six people will be killed, two others presumed dead by suicide, and at least two in hiding. Countless friends and family members will find themselves bereft. I feel it's only fair to warn you that, in this story, justice and redemption have so far proven hard to come by.\nHow did so much go so wrong? When did it begin to fall apart? Trying to answer these questions‚Äîas I‚Äôve done for the past two years‚Äîis not unlike querying a chatbot powered by a large language model. The responses you receive depend on the prompts you compose. Ask the question one way, and you might elicit a set of facts adhering to one reality: The emergence of the world‚Äôs first AI-inflected death cult, whose obsessions over the prospect of a machine superintelligence eventually sent them spiraling into destruction. Tweak the prompt, and you may produce an entirely different story: of a charismatic, deranged leader spreading a carefully engineered mania to followers seeking purpose in life. Try again, and you could get the tale of a vulnerable minority, driven to act at the extremes of their convictions by a society that rejects them.\nBut just like the outputs produced by our current AI oracles, some of these narratives turn out to be rife with hallucinations: plausible-sounding visions of reality, but fabricated to fill the need for a greater meaning. The trouble, as I went along, was separating the truth from the delirium. I wasn't always sure that I could. To be honest, I'm still not. But here we are, and a story has to start somewhere.\nI.\nLet‚Äôs begin on an afternoon in mid-November 2019, under the redwood canopy in Northern California, along a road called Bohemian Highway. It was a Friday, and Sergeant Brian Parks of the Sonoma County Sheriff‚Äôs Office was on patrol along the Russian River near the town of Guerneville when a call came over his radio. Someone had dialed 911 from Westminster Woods, a wilderness camp and retreat center about 8 miles away. The caller reported that a group of several people had driven up and blocked the camp's entrance and exit with their vehicles. They'd gotten out and begun some kind of demonstration, clad in black robes and masks.\nSonoma sheriffs occasionally encounter protesters at Bohemian Grove, a secretive men‚Äôs club for powerful elites that also meets in the redwoods near Guerneville, but the county was typically ‚Äúnot a hotbed‚Äù for that sort of thing, Parks says. So he thought to himself, ‚ÄúYou know what, I'm just going to roll that way,‚Äù and steered his car toward Westminster Woods.\nThe camp was hosting two groups of visitors that day. One was an alumni gathering for a nonprofit called the Center for Applied Rationality. The Bay Area group ran workshops dedicated to ‚Äúdeveloping clear thinking for the sake of humanity's future,‚Äù as they put it. People within and around CFAR, which tended to attract a cohort of young, technically adept seekers, often called themselves simply ‚Äúthe rationalists.‚Äù CFAR was itself an outgrowth of another organization, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, devoted to the technical endeavor of creating artificial intelligence that wouldn't destroy the world.\nBoth CFAR and MIRI were the brainchildren of Eliezer Yudkowsky, the now famous researcher and AI pessimist who had been warning of AI's dangers for decades. In recent years the two organizations had become intertwined with a third group, the philanthropically minded effective altruists. EA, initially focused on maximizing the value in charitable giving, had increasingly taken on MIRI‚Äôs views‚Äînamely, that the existential risk, or x-risk, posed by ‚Äúunfriendly‚Äù AI trumped all of humanity‚Äôs other problems. In the rationalist world, CFAR provided the grand thinking, MIRI the technical know-how, and EA the funding to save humans from being eradicated by runaway machines.\nThe other group at Westminster Woods that day was a class of 18 elementary school children attending a ropes course.\nAs Parks received updates over the radio, it was the presence of kids that upped the stakes for the sheriff‚Äôs department. ‚ÄúThe information I was receiving kind of started to raise the hairs on the back of my neck a little bit,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBecause it didn't seem consistent with your typical protest.‚Äù A new 911 call reported that one of the demonstrators was carrying a gun. ‚ÄúSo at that time I'm thinking it‚Äôs one of two things,‚Äù Parks says. ‚ÄúIs this going to be an active killer? Or is this going to be a hostage standoff?‚Äù\nParks upgraded the police call to a ‚Äúcode 3‚Äù‚Äîa lights and sirens emergency‚Äîand requested more units as he sped toward the camp. He and one of his deputies, Joseph Ricks, pulled up to the entrance within moments of each other and found the driveway blocked by a red Prius. Down a short hill, Parks saw three figures in full-length black cloaks, wearing Guy Fawkes masks, pacing and chanting. He unholstered his gun.\nThis is roughly the point in the story when agreed-upon facts begin to dwindle. In Parks‚Äô account, which he relayed to me in the fall of 2023 at a local Starbucks, the protesters were speaking in unison. ‚ÄúJust stuff I didn't really understand, but it was somewhat rehearsed,‚Äù he said. The group had printed flyers outlining their complaints against CFAR and MIRI. They alleged that MIRI had ‚Äúpaid out blackmail (using donor funds)‚Äù to quash sexual misconduct accusations and that CFAR's leader ‚Äúdiscriminates against trans women.‚Äù Other allegations were more esoteric. CFAR did not ‚Äúappreciably develop novel rationality/mental tech.‚Äù The path to avoiding extinction, they wrote, involved ‚Äúescaping containment by society‚Äù through ‚Äúmental autonomy‚Äù and ‚Äúinterhemispheric game theory.‚Äù\nNone of this would have meant much to Parks. He and Ricks ordered the protesters to get on the ground. As they did, each one called out demanding a same-gender pat down, like one might request at an airport. All three were trans women, but Parks says he couldn't discern their genders because of the robes and masks. Regardless, ‚Äúthey were not going to get that luxury at that point in time,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúIt's like, well, we don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre a boy or a girl and we gotta handcuff you.‚Äù Parks‚Äô deputies subdued the three in prone positions, what Parks calls ‚Äúa high-risk-type takedown‚Äù requiring more force than ‚Äúa normal handcuffing style.‚Äù\nBy now, the police had been told there might be five outsiders on the grounds, including one who was possibly carrying a hatchet. Many of the CFAR alumni hadn‚Äôt even arrived at the site, having received emails from organizers that they shouldn‚Äôt come. The children and their teachers had taken shelter in buildings on the property. As Parks and another deputy moved across a small bridge toward the camp, another robed figure approached them. When Parks yelled for them to put their hands up, he says, the protester‚Äîwho was also a trans woman‚Äîfell onto her back, as if slipping on ice, then struggled briefly with a deputy while being cuffed.\nParks had ordered in the SWAT team, which proceeded to evacuate the children and teachers in an armored vehicle. With the help of a helicopter, the police spent hours searching the 200-acre complex for the fifth, armed protester. In the end, there wasn't one. ‚ÄúWe later learned that it was actually a maintenance worker who had armed himself with the hatchet,‚Äù Parks says. The original reports of protesters carrying weapons had also been false. One had a can of pepper spray, but none of them had a gun.\nThe four were transported, handcuffed, to a detention facility in nearby Santa Rosa. Both sides would agree on one final fact: that the protesters refused to cooperate, in any sense. ‚ÄúI know your face!‚Äù one said to the officers as they were bundled into the facility. ‚ÄúYou are slavers. You are Nazis.‚Äù\nII.\nWhen the story of the protest broke in the local news the following day, it read at first like a kooky Northern California police blotter tale: robed figures among the redwoods, cops bumbling through the underbrush chasing a phantom accomplice. At the jail, though, the clash between the police and the protesters somehow set in motion a story that would end with one demonstrator dead, one missing, one detained, and one on trial for murder.\nThe four protesters‚ÄîEmma Borhanian, Gwen Danielson, Ziz LaSota, and Alex Leatham‚Äîhad all been involved in various ways with the CFAR, MIRI, and EA communities. But they had refused to give their names to the cops, who eventually used fingerprints to identify them. This meant that in early stories about the arrests, LaSota and Leatham were deadnamed‚Äîidentified by their birth names rather than their chosen ones.\nTo the Sheriff's Office this may have seemed a minor oversight, even an unavoidable one. These were, after all, the names the fingerprints had turned up. But it represented the first crack in what would become a rhetorical and factual fissure between the official narrative and that of the protesters. They would be routinely deadnamed in court documents and proceedings, and even by their own attorneys in conversations with me. (In this story, wherever possible, I'm using their given family names, which none officially changed to my knowledge, and their chosen first names and pronouns, as far as I can discern from their own statements and the blogs I've established that they maintained. However, I do at times quote public officials and records that refer to trans people by the pronouns they were assigned at birth.)\nTo the extent that the group had any coherent collective identity, they would come to be known in the rationalist community as ‚Äúthe Zizians.‚Äù To the extent they had a leader, it would be perceived as Ziz LaSota. The members of the group never seemed to adopt this name themselves, nor would they accept its implications: that they were a group at all, that they had a leader. But to the people they‚Äôd splintered off from, it appeared that all troubles flowed back to LaSota.\nLaSota was a 28-year-old software developer who had grown up in Alaska. By her own description, she was technically gifted from a young age. ‚ÄúMy friends and family, even if they think I'm weird, don't seem to be really bothered by the fact that I'm weird,‚Äù she wrote in 2014, in the comments of a post on LessWrong.com, the online forum that serves as a discussion hub for rationalist thought. ‚ÄúBut one thing I can tell you is that I used to de-emphasize my weirdness around them, and then I stopped, and found that being unapologetically weird is a lot more fun.‚Äù\nLaSota began ‚Äúreading up on EA and x-risk,‚Äù she wrote later, as an undergraduate in computer engineering at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. That‚Äôs also when she was ‚Äústarting to donate to MIRI.‚Äù She interned at the software giant Oracle and at NASA, developing a tool for space weather analysis. But around the time she graduated, she began to wonder whether she should commit to graduate school in computer science or pursue a job as a computer engineer and ‚Äúearn to give‚Äù‚Äîthe effective altruism term for making as much money as possible in order to donate it. (The concept is now most attached to convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, but at the time it was still novel, as the EA movement took off in the Bay Area.)\nLaSota writes that she contacted Anna Salamon, the executive director of CFAR, to ask for advice. According to LaSota‚Äôs account, Salamon ‚Äúsaid actually I should go to grad school, find a startup cofounder, drop out and earn to give via startups instead.‚Äù (Salamon declined to comment for this story.) After attending grad school for a while and then dropping out‚Äîwithout snagging a cofounder‚ÄîLaSota moved to the Bay Area and worked for a gaming company, then a biological instruments startup.\nDisenchanted with what she viewed as the hollowness of startup culture, LaSota increasingly turned to the rationalist community for answers. Since the early 2000s, when Yudkowsky had started gathering like-minded individuals to warn about the dangers of AI, the community had evolved from a largely technical movement to a social one. At workshops, in group houses, and on LessWrong.com, rationalists engaged in extended philosophical debate about AI, game theory, the singularity (in which a superintelligence would arise in one, instantaneous moment), and how to live a more rational life.\nMuch of their discussion, online and off, was obscure. Partly this was the result of the technical concepts underpinning theories about the future of AI. But the arcane language around ‚Äúinfohazards,‚Äù ‚Äúbasilisks,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSchelling points‚Äù also served a more exclusive purpose. It was a lexicon required for acceptance into a kind of priesthood, a self-declared bulwark against the destruction of humanity itself.\nLaSota dove into the debates, sometimes passionately enough to alarm her fellow rationalists‚Äîmany of whom she increasingly regarded, in at least one respect, as morally repellent. ‚ÄúI'd been a vegan first,‚Äù she later wrote, ‚Äúand my primary concern upon learning about the singularity was how do I make this benefit all sentient life, not just humans. I described my feelings towards flesh-eating monsters, who had created hell on Earth [for] more people than those they had helped.‚Äù (In Ziz‚Äôs writing, anyone who eats meat is a ‚Äúflesh-eating monster,‚Äù and sentient animals are ‚Äúpeople.‚Äù)\nIn 2016, LaSota attended an eight-day CFAR program called the Workshop on AI Safety Strategy. One event included a session of ‚Äú‚Äòdoom circles,‚Äô‚Äù she later wrote, where each participant ‚Äútook turns having everyone else bluntly but compassionately say why they were doomed‚Äù and also weighed in themselves. The session elicited difficult soul searching from LaSota about whether she was ‚Äúmorally valuable‚Äù and ‚Äúnet positive‚Äù to Earth‚Äîwhether her life would contribute to saving humanity at all. ‚ÄúWhen it was my turn,‚Äù LaSota wrote, ‚ÄúI said my doom was that I could succeed at the things I tried, succeed exceptionally well, like I bet I could in 10 years have earned to give like 10 million dollars through startups, and it would still be too little too late, and ultimately the world would still burn.‚Äù\nIII.\nThe Zizians came together over the next two years, splintering off one by one from the established rationalist and EA communities. Gwen Danielson, a high-achieving prep school graduate from Washington state who‚Äôd studied electrical engineering, math, and cognitive science at Rice University, met LaSota in the mid-2010s. They bonded over their experiences in the soul-sucking Bay Area real estate market, which often shunted rationalist-curious arrivals into toxic group-living situations or debt. ‚ÄúMost of the money donated by earn-to-givers [was] going to landlords,‚Äù Danielson wrote. ‚ÄúWe both recognized housing as one of the most obvious problems with the Bay area rationalist community.‚Äù\nIn 2016, the pair began living together on a small sailboat Danielson owned, in the Berkeley Marina. LaSota, after learning some sailing basics, bought her own 24-foot boat for $600 off Craigslist. She named it the Black Cygnet and began living on it. From there, the pair decided to expand their life at sea and create ‚Äúa federated fleet of boats‚Äù that would provide housing for rationalists ‚Äúin order to improve the rate of work on AI safety.‚Äù They‚Äôd call it the Rationalist Fleet. Danielson, LaSota, and a third comrade purchased a 70-year-old Navy tugboat that had been christened Caleb, and LaSota traveled to Alaska to sail it down, together with acquaintances she‚Äôd recruited via online rationalist groups.\nNinety-four feet long and striped with rust, the boat was fraught with problems from the beginning. LaSota and Danielson managed to reach the Bay Area with it but had trouble finding a cheap place to anchor. They became consumed with the struggle to keep the vessel seaworthy. Marooned for days and weeks onboard, pondering their deteriorating surroundings, they began creating their own unique philosophies. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been somewhat isolated from the rationalist community for a while,‚Äù LaSota wrote to a correspondent at the time, ‚Äúand in the course developed a significant chunk of unique art of rationality and theories of psychology aimed at solving our problems.‚Äù\nAs LaSota articulated it, their goals had moved beyond real estate into a more grandiose realm. ‚ÄúWe are trying to build a cabal,‚Äù she wrote. The aim was ‚Äúto find abnormally intrinsically good people and turn them all into Gervais-sociopaths, creating a fundamentally different kind of group than I have heard of existing before.‚Äù (The Gervais principle, articulated by the writer Venkatesh Rao‚Äîbased on an extensive but light-hearted analysis of The Office‚Äîis a theory that at the top of any organization are ‚Äúsociopaths‚Äù who know how to acquire and manipulate power. Beneath them are the loyal ‚Äúclueless‚Äù and the disaffected ‚Äúlosers.‚Äù) Sociopathy, LaSota wrote, would allow the group‚Äôs members to operate ‚Äúunpwned by the external world.‚Äù\n‚ÄúGervais-sociopaths‚Äù was a foundational concept in LaSota‚Äôs increasingly tangled ideology, the kind that went beyond even the most impenetrable thinking found on LessWrong.com. On her blog, at Sinceriously.fyi, she outlined that ideology across 100,000 words over several years, on topics ranging from engineering, to her personal history, to psychological manipulation, to gender theory, to the future motivations of a superior artificial intelligence.\nI have read this corpus in its entirety more than once, and attempting to summarize LaSota‚Äôs or Zizian thought by quoting from it is an almost impossible exercise. It would be akin to explaining a person‚Äôs life by examining remnants of charred photos salvaged from a house consumed by fire. To a reader unstudied in rationalist-inflected thought‚Äîand even to many at the time who were‚Äîthe blog could read like the work of an intelligent but unhinged mind:\nGood is at an inherent disadvantage in epistemic drinking contests. But we have an advantage: I am actually willing to die to advance good.\nAt one point, I saw a married couple, one of them doing AI alignment research, who were planning to have a baby. They agreed that the researcher would also sleep in the room with the crying baby in the middle of the night, not to take any load off the other. Just a signal of some kind. Make things even. And I realized that I was no longer able to stand people.\nLiches have trouble thinking clearly about paths through probability space that conflict with their phylactery, and the more conjunctive a mission it is to make true their phylactery, the more bits of epistemics will be corrupted by their refusal to look into that abyss.\nHowever opaque LaSota‚Äôs ideology may have seemed to outsiders, there were some in the rationalist community who felt its pull‚Äîincluding her shipmate Danielson, Emma Borhanian, and Alex Leatham. Borhanian was a former Google engineer; Leatham had studied mathematics at UC Berkeley and UCLA. To them, the normies who dismissed Ziz were no different than the friends and family who failed to understand the implications of AI superintelligence.\nLaSota and her compatriots, who‚Äôd bought into the need for sentient life to be saved from AI, increasingly found MIRI and CFAR insufficiently committed to that mission. ‚ÄúThey are obviously not taking heroic responsibility for the outcome of this world,‚Äù Danielson wrote. At best, the Bay Area organizations were doing ‚Äúniche research.‚Äù At worst, they were actively corrupt, even abusive. LaSota and those in her orbit alleged that CFAR and its leadership were laced with anti-trans beliefs and practices. (‚ÄúThat's preposterous,‚Äù one member of the rationalist community, who is also trans, told me. ‚ÄúRationalists have the most trans people of any group I've seen that isn't explicitly about being trans. You'd just show up at a math event or house party, and it would be 20 percent trans.‚Äù)\nWithin the labyrinth of LaSota‚Äôs writing, even the most perplexed reader could locate the essence of her aspiration: to attain a hero‚Äôs role, with a commitment to an unassailable moral code. She yearned for action in support of that code, the kind of action that most humans‚Äîand rationalists‚Äîlacked the moral fortitude to pursue.\nSo the group set about trying to ‚Äúinstall‚Äù new ‚Äúmental tech,‚Äù as they described it, to ‚Äújailbreak‚Äù their minds from convention. They began wearing all black, identifying their philosophy as ‚Äúvegan anarchotranshumanism‚Äù and their spiritual beliefs as ‚Äúvegan sith.‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Sith do what they want deep down,‚Äù LaSota explained. ‚ÄúThey remove all obstructions to that.‚Äù)\nDanielson developed an elaborate psychological theory around brain hemispheres, soon taken up by LaSota. A person‚Äôs core consisted of two hemispheres, each one intrinsically good or nongood. In extremely rare cases they could be ‚Äúdouble good‚Äù‚Äîa condition that, it so happened, LaSota identified in herself. A person‚Äôs two hemispheres could be at war with each other, but it was possible to gain awareness and even control of them through a process called ‚Äúdebucketing.‚Äù LaSota and Danielson began experimenting with something they called ‚Äúunihemispheric sleep,‚Äù which they believed allowed them to put portions of their brain into slow wave sleep while remaining consciously awake. It was, LaSota wrote, ‚Äúa means of keeping restless watch while alone.‚Äù\nIn their four months on the boat, however, LaSota and Danielson‚Äôs theorizing seemed to outpace their seafaring skills. In November 2017, the Coast Guard had to retrieve Caleb after the 345-ton tug dragged its anchor and collided with other boats in the harbor, while carrying hundreds of gallons of oily bilge water. Ultimately the vessel became too expensive to maintain, and the group abandoned it. (In 2022, the operators of Pillar Point Harbor in San Mateo County, where Caleb had been left behind, spent more than $50,000 to tow the boat back out to sea. One month later, it sank.) ‚ÄúAfter Rationalist Fleet I updated away from boats being a good idea for housing,‚Äù Danielson wrote, ‚Äúin favor of well-outfitted stealth RVs.‚Äù\nFor now, the friends seemed scattered and vulnerable, with tenuous housing and social worlds in flux. ‚ÄúI was kind of homeless,‚Äù Leatham later wrote of the time. But they were increasingly united around the idea of taking action. ‚ÄúI de-facto lead without authority,‚Äù LaSota wrote. ‚ÄúJust like I did a lot of in Rationalist Fleet even though Gwen was the boss formally (and the high level strategic vision as well, actually). Real leaders don‚Äôt need authority.‚Äù\nIV.\nBy the day of the CFAR reunion at Westminster Woods, in November 2019, the schism between the rationalist mothership and LaSota‚Äôs small faction had taken a more aggressive turn. The splinter group had suggested they could sue over what they believed to be anti-trans discrimination by CFAR‚Äôs leaders and had become verbally confrontational online and at CFAR meetups.\nTo the larger rationalist community, their writing seemed increasingly unhinged, even threatening. ‚ÄúVengeance and justice are in the hands of anyone who wants it,‚Äù Leatham wrote. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to appeal to anyone to take revenge.‚Äù Salamon, CFAR‚Äôs executive director, later wrote on Facebook that she‚Äôd begun to feel ‚Äúextreme fear‚Äù toward LaSota. She recalled that LaSota had posted to Discord, ‚ÄúIf MIRI attempts to silence me using governmental force ‚Ä¶ that would be physical violence. If they escalate to physical violence, we are prepared to perform self-defense.‚Äù\nThere were Byzantine levels to this inter-community drama that defy summary, played out across endless threads on Discord, LessWrong, and Tumblr. As self-described vegan Siths, LaSota and Danielson expressed outrage that MIRI‚Äôs efforts to create human-friendly AI didn‚Äôt seem to include other animals in the equation.\nThe group had become especially fixated on a particular rumor, namely that the nonprofit MIRI had potentially used donor money to pay off a former staffer. The ex-employee had launched a website accusing MIRI leaders of statutory rape and a coverup. Though the facts were never litigated in a courtroom, MIRI‚Äôs president wrote in 2019 that he had checked ‚Äúsome of the most serious allegations‚Äù and ‚Äúfound them to be straightforwardly false.‚Äù The website‚Äôs owner had agreed to retract the claims and take the site down, the president said, under conditions that were confidential. But what angered LaSota and Danielson was as much the idea‚Äîin their minds at least‚Äîthat the nonprofit had succumbed to blackmail as the allegations themselves. In negotiating, they believed, the organization had violated one of its fundamental principles: ‚Äútimeless decision theory,‚Äù a concept developed by MIRI cofounder Eliezer Yudkowsky. (Yudkowsky, who later renamed it ‚Äúfunctional decision theory,‚Äù declined to comment for this story.)\nWithout getting mired in the details‚Äîwhich, unfortunately, are extremely difficult to distill without getting into game theory‚Äîsuffice it to say: Timeless decision theory asserts that, in making a decision, a person should consider not just the outcome of that specific choice but also their own underlying patterns of reasoning‚Äîand those of their past and future selves (not least because these patterns might one day be anticipated by an omniscient, adversarial AI). LaSota, in her writing, seems to have interpreted this metaphysical game as a call to operate ‚Äútimelessly‚Äù‚Äîto treat one‚Äôs choices as if they affected the fate of all sentient life across temporal horizons. Under this line of thinking, one should never back down or surrender, no matter what. In any case, the Zizians believed that timeless decision theorists are supposed to resist blackmail, and they perceived this purported betrayal of principle as deeper than the crime itself.\nAccording to Danielson‚Äôs later writing, the group planned a series of talks to communicate all of this at the Westminster Woods reunion. Days before, however, CFAR‚Äôs leadership barred Danielson and LaSota from attending. So they arrived instead in their robes and masks, three-page flyers in hand. ‚ÄúMIRICFAR betrayed us,‚Äù the flyers read in part. ‚ÄúIt is not what it once seemed like it would become. New things can be built.‚Äù\nV.\nFollowing their arrests, each of the four spent several days in jail before bailing out. Prosecutors charged them with five misdemeanors, for crimes like false imprisonment of the campers, willful cruelty to a child, and wearing a mask for an ‚Äúunlawful purpose.‚Äù They also layered on a felony, for conspiracy, that carried the threat of serious prison time.\nBut LaSota and the other three, on their blogs and in legal briefs, cast themselves as the victims. In their defense filings, the group argued that they‚Äôd traveled to Westminster Woods ‚Äúto protest the cover-up of the sexual abuse of minors‚Äù by CFAR. They couldn‚Äôt have known that the elementary school children would also be on the property or that camp staffers would interpret their protest as an active shooter situation. They accused the police of filing false reports and the county district attorney of ‚Äúmalicious prosecution‚Äù on ‚Äútrumped-up criminal charges.‚Äù\n‚ÄúDon't we know by now that the word of a cop isn't worth shit?‚Äù Michelle Zajko, another young trans rationalist who traveled in the group‚Äôs circles but hadn‚Äôt attended the protest, wrote later. The false gun claim and police presence, she wrote, were ‚Äúa fairly standard example of a phenomenon called ‚Äòswatting‚Äô where someone deceives emergency services into sending police based on false reporting.‚Äù\nThe group hired a lawyer and filed a civil rights complaint against the Sonoma County authorities on the grounds that they‚Äôd been subjected to excessive force and that their requests for same-gender searches had been ignored. The searches the male officers had conducted, including under their clothing, they alleged, ‚Äúamounted to sexual assault and battery.‚Äù After being brought to the jail, the complaint alleged, the group had their clothing ‚Äúforcibly stripped off their bodies.‚Äù They said the officers then ‚Äúcrowded around to look at the Claimants‚Äô genitals and naked bodies.‚Äù They were then ‚Äútortured‚Äù over a number of days, they said, ‚Äúwoken whenever they started to fall asleep ‚Ä¶ and were kept naked and cold for days.‚Äù\nWith the arrival of the pandemic, both cases slowed to a crawl, and the group seemed to grow more isolated and inward-looking. Their collective exile from the rationalist community was virtually complete. They were banned from LessWrong.com, along with various CFAR meetups and conferences. An anonymous rationalist launched a site, Zizians.info, branding them ‚Äúthe Zizians‚Äù for the first time and warning that the group was a cult. The page, which LaSota called ‚Äúa rationalist smear site,‚Äù alleged that LaSota‚Äôs unihemispheric sleep practices had led to the 2018 suicide of a trans woman attached to the group, Maia Pasek. (LaSota wrote that unihemispheric sleep ‚Äúdid not doom Pasek.‚Äù But her own description of her interactions with Pasek, titled ‚ÄúPasek‚Äôs Doom‚Äù and including lines like ‚ÄúWe each went on our journey of jailbreaking into psychopathy fully‚Äù and ‚ÄúPasek‚Äôs right hemisphere had been ‚Äòmostly-dead,‚Äô‚Äù did little to rebut the accusations.)\nWhatever thread of attachment they‚Äôd felt to the rationalists was snapped by the response to the protests. ‚Äú‚ÄòRationalists‚Äô‚Äù are so evil,\" Leatham wrote. ‚Äúi dont know how to express how evil they are. many of them are just authoritarians ‚Ä¶ Not a single ‚Äòrationalist‚Äô cisfem stood up for me ‚Ä¶ i wont forget this.‚Äù\nParts of the rationalist community had become increasingly concerned about what LaSota and her acolytes might do next. ‚ÄúDo you know whether Ziz owns or has easy access to any weapons?‚Äù one member wrote on Facebook. ‚ÄúDoes she currently have a plan to obtain a weapon?‚Äù A moderator on LessWrong wrote that ‚Äúboth Ziz and Gwen have a sufficient track record of being aggressive offline (and Ziz also online) that I don‚Äôt really want them around on LessWrong or to provide a platform to them.‚Äù One rationalist recalled that ‚ÄúCFAR spent a bunch of money hiring professional security.‚Äù\nIn turn, LaSota and the others wrote of vengeance against the ‚Äútimeless‚Äù decisions of others. ‚ÄúIf you truly irreconcilably disagree with someone's creative choice, i.e. their choice extending arbitrarily far into the past and future, ultimately your only recourse is to kill them,‚Äù one LaSota ally wrote in a long blog post citing Ziz‚Äôs philosophies. In the comments, LaSota wrote, ‚ÄúI am so fucking glad to finally have an equal.‚Äù\nIn the spring of 2021, a rationalist named Jay Winterford, who went by the name Fluttershy, died by suicide. Winterford had spent time on Caleb with LaSota and Danielson, where LaSota had described trying to ‚Äúfix/upgrade‚Äù him, and for years he seemingly grappled with LaSota‚Äôs ideas as a way out of childhood traumas. To rationalist watchers of the group, Winterford seemed to constitute a second casualty of its ideology.\nIn court, by summer 2021, the four had turned against their own defense lawyers, accusing one of misconduct. A month later, representing herself, Leatham filed to have the state judge Shelly Averill disqualified from the case on the grounds that she had ‚Äúrepeatedly misgendered me and my codefendants, including twice under penalty of perjury, and 10 times on the first court date after my writ petition where I told her misgendering me was bias and misconduct.‚Äù (Judge Averill admitted to misgendering Leatham but replied that she did not ‚Äúmisspeak intentionally or in any way intend to cause party offense.‚Äù A higher court ruled against Leatham.)\nAnother Leatham filing included numbered objections like ‚Äú2. Shelly Averill is evil.‚Äù ‚Äú3. Shelly Averill has read my previous accusation that she is evil and has not denied that she is evil.‚Äù ‚Äú5. ‚Ä¶ Shelly Averill has omnicidal intent‚Äîshe wants to destroy everything‚Äîespecially prioritizing that which is good.‚Äù And ‚Äú11. I will never be a man, no matter how much humans like Shelly Averill want to eradicate that truth from existence.‚Äù\nWhen their civil rights complaint for harassment and torture was thrown out, the four filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the police and two administrators at Westminster Woods‚Äîwhom they accused of intentionally fabricating the claim that one of them was armed, in order to prompt a stronger police response. They again asserted that the police had infringed on their speech, sexually assaulted them, and denied them food and medication in custody, amounting to torture. The police opposed a subpoena to release any video from the jail, calling them ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù files that would constitute ‚Äúan undue burden‚Äù to sort through.\nEven mired in their ongoing legal battles, the group still seemed to be expanding. Now hovering around the Zizian orbit was a figure named Alice Monday‚Äîwhom LaSota had described as ‚Äúsort of a mentor to me‚Äù‚Äîand Michelle Zajko, the young rationalist who compared the Westminster Woods response to a swatting. She was trans nonbinary and a recent bioinformatics master‚Äôs graduate from Pennsylvania. By the spring of 2022, an EA adherent and recent UC Berkeley student with chunky black glasses named Daniel Blank was also around. Blank, a cisgender man whose blog showed him captivated by LaSota‚Äôs ideas, was noted in the court file as having delivered one of Leatham‚Äôs lengthy objections to the court.\nA few weeks later, after Danielson failed to show up for a hearing, Averill issued a bench warrant for her arrest. Then, at a hearing of the federal lawsuit, on August 19, the group‚Äôs attorney asked for a stay in the case. He said he believed that Gwen Danielson had died by suicide.\nOne half of the founding Zizian brain trust was apparently gone. The other was soon to vanish as well.\nVI.\nOut on the waters of San Francisco Bay that night of August 19, 2022, it was balmy and breezy, with a light swell. At 11:05, the Coast Guard command center in San Francisco received a distress call from a woman on a boat traveling south across the bay. The woman, Naomi LaSota, reported that her 31-year-old brother had fallen overboard, somewhere south of the Bay Bridge. Naomi, Ziz, and Borhanian had gone out for an afternoon sail on Ziz LaSota‚Äôs boat, the Black Cygnet. But as they were heading back to the marina, Naomi reported, her brother‚Äîas she referred to Ziz in her communications with the Coast Guard‚Äîhad leaned over the motor and fallen in.\nAccording to official Coast Guard logs obtained through a Freedom of Information Act Request, the sister said her brother had not been wearing a life preserver, and she was ‚Äúunable to determine exact location or area where brother fell overboard due to unfamiliarity with the boat.‚Äù\nThe Coast Guard deployed in force, knowing that time was of the essence. All available boats, helicopters, planes, and drones launched into action, including the marine rescue units of the Oakland and Alameda fire departments.\nThe crews searched through the night, obtaining ‚Äúfatigue waivers‚Äù to forgo their normal shifts to keep going. They ran patterns through the Bay out under the Golden Gate Bridge, from Yerba Buena Island all the way to Land‚Äôs End and back down the shore through San Francisco. They returned with only ‚Äúnegative results,‚Äù in search-and-rescue-speak. There was no sign of the person who‚Äôd fallen overboard.\nAt 3 am, LaSota‚Äôs sister called for assistance again. After the Coast Guard boats had moved on to where LaSota might have drifted, the other two had no idea how to sail back, and the Black Cygnet was now drifting near some rocks. A Coast Guard unit was diverted from the search to tow it into a marina. By 9 am, the operations center had coordinated with the missing boater‚Äôs other next of kin. At around 5 pm, after 18 hours, the Coast Guard told LaSota‚Äôs family that they were suspending the search. Their computer modeling, they said, showed LaSota could not have survived that long in the water.\nMore than two weeks later, an obituary appeared for LaSota in The Daily News-Miner, in Fairbanks. ‚ÄúLoving adventure, friends and family, music, blueberries, biking, computer games and animals, you are missed,‚Äù it read. That November, Naomi filed to obtain a death certificate for LaSota, with affidavits from herself and Borhanian recounting the incident, both of them using LaSota‚Äôs given, legal name. ‚ÄúNo friends or family,‚Äù she wrote, had seen or heard from LaSota since August 19, 2022.\nVII.\nWith LaSota and Danielson both presumed dead, the Zizian ideology started to feel like an afterthought in the rationalist community. Even before Danielson‚Äôs reported suicide and LaSota‚Äôs disappearance, some of the leading lights of rationalist thinking had taken to LessWrong to publicly discuss what the experiences around Ziz had meant, as if she no longer existed. ‚ÄúZiz tried to create an anti-CFAR/MIRI splinter group whose members had mental breakdowns,‚Äù Scott Alexander, the author of the prominent Slate Star Codex blog, wrote in a lengthy discussion of MIRI, CFAR, and other mental health incidents that had taken place in the community. Another poster wrote: ‚ÄúThe splinter group seems to have selected for high scrupulosity and not attenuated its mental impact.‚Äù\nAs for others who had been part of LaSota‚Äôs Bay Area circle, Michelle Zajko and Alice Monday appeared to have moved to the East Coast. Voter rolls from 2022 show them residing in Coventry, Vermont, on a 20-acre wooded property in an unfinished house, purchased more than one year earlier through an anonymous trust.\nThe two remaining Westminster Woods protesters, Borhanian and Leatham, had taken up a precarious residence on a property in Vallejo, northeast of San Francisco. Owned by an 80-year-old former shipworker and crane operator named Curtis Lind, the fenced-off land was pressed up against a steep hillside. Dotted with box trucks, decommissioned boats, and piles of junk, it gave the impression of a salvage yard. It was in a rough corner of town, a friend of Lind‚Äôs recalled‚Äîthe site of drug dealings and shootings. On the opposite side of the hill was a waterfront featuring derelict boats and a regular homeless encampment.\nLind had decided to monetize the property; he brought in RVs and shipping containers and took on tenants to work and live cheaply in them. But the property lacked water or electricity. According to the friend, Lind had once blown out the neighborhood transformer by tapping it for power.\nBorhanian and Leatham lived in an RV on the property and remained occupied with fighting the charges stemming from the protest. Each court filing of Leatham‚Äôs, who was by now attempting to represent herself, became harder to follow. In September 2022 she filed one titled ‚ÄúNotion of Motion and Motion to Dismiss the Imposter Police Officer From all Conflicting Positions on this Case, Including but not Limited to Their Witnessed Reincarnations as Judge and District Attorney.‚Äù\nThere were other characters hanging around Borhanian and Leatham at the property, including a mysterious blond woman and another young rationalist named Suri Dao‚Äîwho identified as ‚Äúbi-gender‚Äù and blogged that she ‚Äúpreferred either she/her or he/him pronouns.‚Äù The group‚Äôs lease had been arranged years before by Gwen Danielson. But Lind claimed that no one had paid rent in years. By October he‚Äôd won a $60,000 judgement against the group and was working to evict them.\nWhat took place between the remaining group and Lind one Sunday morning that November would once again bisect reality into two irreconcilable versions. According to the account that Lind gave police‚Äîand that his tenant Patrick McMillan gave the local news‚Äîthe group learned that the county sheriff would be pursuing the eviction on November 15. On the morning of the 13th, Lind later alleged, Dao lured him out to their trailer by saying there was a water leak, then multiple figures stabbed him with kitchen knives more than a dozen times, including through the eye. At some point Lind pulled a gun, and Leatham allegedly ran a samurai sword through his left shoulder and out from his stomach. Lind fired, killing Borhanian and wounding Leatham at least twice.\nMcMillan claimed he awoke to a knock at his door and found Lind standing at his trailer with the sword still protruding from his body. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm dying!‚Äô and he had blood squirting out of him,‚Äù McMillan told a local TV news reporter a few days later. ‚ÄúI guess they figured if they killed him, they couldn‚Äôt be evicted.‚Äù\nWhen the police arrived, they found Borhanian dead, Leatham with gunshot wounds, and Lind bleeding from his eye with a sword sticking through his chest. The cops arrested Dao at the scene, while Leatham and Lind were both transported to the hospital. The blond friend of the group, who police said gave her name as Julia Dawson, was taken to the station for questioning. But after having what appeared to be a medical emergency, she was sent to the hospital as well. From there, she quietly slipped away.\nWhen Leatham recovered from her injuries enough for the case to proceed, she and Dao were charged with the attempted murder of Lind and the felony murder of their own friend, Borhanian. (Although Lind had pulled the trigger, California law allows prosecutors to essentially charge instigators of a conflict with any murder that results from it.) Lind, among other injuries, lost an eye.\nAt least in the small group of supporters who showed up for Dao and Leatham at court hearings, another version of events took hold. Lind, according to this story, had been threatening and harassing the tenants for months, and that morning had entered their home and shot them unprompted. (It‚Äôs unclear, in this account, how Lind was stabbed through the chest and eye.) ‚ÄúEmma was no harm to anything or anyone,‚Äù a person close to Borhanian said in a 2022 interview, alleging that Lind‚Äôs story had changed over time. The group was being presumed guilty because they were neurodiverse, she said. ‚ÄúThis man ended the life of this brilliant, brilliant woman.‚Äù\nAs the murder charges entered their long slog through the California courts, the other cases involving the original four protesters fell away. The protest charges were put on hold, and the group‚Äôs attorney in the federal civil rights lawsuit‚Äîwhich alleged the four were ‚Äútortured‚Äù after Westminster Woods‚Äîwas preparing to withdraw from the case, saying he could no longer reach his clients. (The case was later dismissed.)\nTwo days after the sword attack, the Vallejo police contacted the Coast Guard command center to follow up on its missing boater case. One of the people who‚Äôd been on the boat when LaSota went missing, Emma Borhanian, been shot and killed in the Lind attack, they reported. But they had another startling discovery to share. LaSota herself was alive and had been living in Vallejo ‚Äúfor the past six months,‚Äù the detective said. Julia Dawson, the woman who‚Äôd slipped away from the hospital, was Ziz LaSota.\nVIII.\nMichelle Zajko grew up in an upscale neighborhood in the town of Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, just southwest of Philadelphia. A sharp and creative student who penned her own fantasy stories, she first became involved in the effective altruism movement as an undergraduate biology major at nearby Cabrini University, bringing an EA discussion group to campus. ‚ÄúI want to help save people for my career, but this is a way I can do it now,‚Äù she told her college newspaper in 2013. The same year, Zajko presented a paper about applying Bayesian decision theory in everyday life. ‚ÄúBecause people maintain consistency in their beliefs, they often continue to make the same decisions, even if those decisions are not optimal,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúStructuring one's decisionmaking strategies in accordance with mathematics and decision theory would result in outcomes that grant higher expected utility than using no strategies.‚Äù She earned a master‚Äôs degree in bioinformatics from Temple University and worked as an intern at NASA and at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia.\nBy 2019, Zajko‚Äîknown as Jamie in Ziz-connected circles‚Äîrelocated to California, where she entered the wider rationalist social scene and started dating Alice Monday. (Monday couldn‚Äôt be located for this story.) Monday was a controversial figure, accused on multiple blogs of physically and mentally abusing her housemates. Alex Leatham wrote that ‚Äúabout once a week for several months [Monday] would take a length of bamboo and beat my friend emma with it. this is their attempted new order.‚Äù\nMonday never responded publicly to the accusations, and Zajko seemed not to have complaints of her own. ‚ÄúI had spoken with her while she was out in California, and she was very happy,‚Äù her aunt Rosanne Zajko told me. ‚ÄúShe said that she and her girlfriend, Alice, would be moving to Vermont.‚Äù The Bay Area was expensive‚Äî‚ÄúI think she used the word ‚Äòsoul-crushing,‚Äô‚Äù Rosanne said, ‚Äúand they were looking for a change of scenery.‚Äù Monday and Zajko relocated together to Vermont by early 2021.\nThe Vermont property was isolated, just 20 miles from the Canadian border. ‚ÄúLong driveway and mountain top setting is really what sets this apart from most homes, total solitude,‚Äù a real estate listing noted. Rosanne says that Zajko became increasingly estranged from her family after she arrived in Vermont‚Äîan estrangement Rosanne attributes to Zajko‚Äôs California friends, including LaSota. ‚ÄúMichelle is a very very intelligent person,‚Äù Rosanne said. ‚ÄúShe's always been a very independent thinker, someone who is intellectually curious. I see how she goes out there and wants to learn more, but how she actually got to fall under the influence of that group is something I do not understand and I have no answers for.‚Äù\nIn her online writings, Zajko expressed growing concern about anti-trans sentiments she saw in the news. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already past the start of a trans genocide,‚Äù she wrote on her Tumblr in 2022. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt own a gun, consider getting one, learning to shoot it, and investigating community self-defense. Fascist militias are an arm of the anti-trans genocide who are acting as low-level enforcers.‚Äù She also alluded to what she described as past ‚Äúabuse‚Äù by her parents. They‚Äôd threatened to go to a judge friend and have her put in foster care, even kill her if she ran away, she wrote. She said she‚Äôd ‚Äútried explaining‚Äù it to her aunt, Rosanne. ‚ÄúShe sadly didn‚Äôt believe me,‚Äù Zajko wrote. ‚ÄúSome people don‚Äôt want to hear about the ugliness in the world, because then they‚Äôd feel obligated to do something about it.‚Äù\nRosanne‚Äôs recollection of these same events, and of Zajko‚Äôs parents, was irreconcilable with what her niece wrote. Some time after seeing the posts, she emailed Michelle. ‚ÄúI take issue with one of your posts where you said I knew about abuse but preferred to do nothing,‚Äù Rosanne wrote. ‚ÄúThat was a huge surprise to me. I felt that you stabbed me in the back with that comment.‚Äù Rosanne had been a witness to disputes between Michelle and her parents, she said‚Äîeven taken Michelle‚Äôs side‚Äîbut said the arguments she knew of never amounted to anything approaching abuse. ‚ÄúDid she express to me any resentment or anger or hate against her parents? Not at all.‚Äù\nIn 2021, Michelle Zajko bought another half acre of land in Derby, 15 miles from Coventry. It‚Äôs unclear how long Monday and Zajko stayed together in Vermont. But in February 2022, Zajko blogged about having recently had long conversations with LaSota. The latter had accused Zajko of, essentially, gossiping about her with Monday and playing mind games. ‚ÄúZiz informed me that the only way I could gain her trust and make up for what I did to her,‚Äù Zajko alleged, ‚Äúwas to murder Alice.‚Äù LaSota, according to the post, had told her how to construct a DIY suppressor for a gun and suggested lye to get rid of the body. ‚ÄúAnd if I didn't do it,‚Äù she continued, ‚ÄúZiz planned to drive across the entire continental United States to murder me.‚Äù\nZajko seemed to vacillate between suspecting it might all be a rhetorical game and genuinely believing Ziz intended to kill her and Monday both. ‚ÄúZiz, like myself, does not forgive or forget, not even after years have passed,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúWhile I have the tenacity, skill, and willingness to evade Ziz and her friends indefinitely, it‚Äôs a waste of resources. We're currently facing the collapse of civilization, a looming civil war, unfriendly AI, and a fuckton of other threats, and instead of focusing on those, we‚Äôre wasting resources respectively hunting and evading each other.‚Äù\nThe conversation seemed unresolved. But between musings on Dune and Siths, Zajko drew what would later come to feel like a crucial distinction: between the ‚Äúthe world where I'm a complete psycopath [sic],‚Äù killing to please Ziz, and the one ‚Äúwhere I kill my abuser.‚Äù\nIX.\nBack in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, Michelle Zajko‚Äôs parents lived in the stately four-bedroom home they‚Äôd owned since the late 1980s. Richard and Rita Zajko had raised Michelle there, in a cul-de-sac development with other young families. Richard worked for a company that had a contract with the nearby Navy yard, while Rita stayed home. Now that Michelle, an only child, was out of the house and the couple was in their late sixties and early seventies, their life was quiet, arranged around a tight circle of concern. Rita‚Äôs parents were ill and lived nearby, said Rosanne, and a lot of Rita and Richard‚Äôs time ‚Äúwas taken up in caring for them.‚Äù\nToward the end of 2022, Rosanne had fallen into the habit of talking to Rita every Sunday. ‚ÄúWe were both caregivers,‚Äù she said‚ÄîRita for her parents, and now Rosanne for her husband, Rick‚Äôs brother, who was on the verge of entering memory care. ‚ÄúIt was grueling and draining,‚Äù she said, and she knew Rita could understand.\n‚ÄúOn December 31, I put it out there in the universe: Can 2023 be the year where I have no catastrophes?‚Äù Rosanne recalled thinking. ‚ÄúCan it be a good year?‚Äù The next morning she texted Rita to wish her a happy New Year but received no reply.\nThree days later, Rosanne said, she got a call from another of Rick‚Äôs brothers. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why he would be calling, but let me pick it up,‚Äù she remembered thinking. ‚ÄúHe just comes out with it and says ‚ÄòRick and Rita have been murdered.‚Äô‚Äù\nSometime late on New Year‚Äôs Eve, the police later determined, someone had killed the couple inside their home, shooting them each in the head with a 9mm handgun. There was no sign of a break-in, and the authorities quickly concluded that the assailant must be someone the couple knew. According to a search warrant application in the case, Ring camera footage from across the street had captured a car pulling up to the house at 11:29 that night. Two minutes later, ‚Äúa higher-pitched voice is heard shouting what sounds like ‚ÄòMom!‚Äô‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúOh my god! Oh God! God!‚Äù Two figures are then recorded entering the house, then exiting nine minutes later and driving away.\nThe Zajkos, two sources familiar with the case later confirmed to me, had been killed in Michelle‚Äôs childhood bedroom. December 31 was her birthday.\nRosanne was devastated. ‚ÄúI stayed on the floor,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI wasn't comprehending it: How can this happen to Rita and Rick, of all people?‚Äù She wondered briefly why Michelle hadn‚Äôt called to deliver the news. ‚ÄúLike, she has to know, but why didn‚Äôt she call and tell us?‚Äù she remembers thinking. But then she thought: ‚ÄúHow would I react if I got the news that both of my parents were murdered? I would be in shock.‚Äù\nX.\nThree days after the bodies were discovered, on January 5, a pair of Pennsylvania state troopers traveled to Vermont to interview Michelle Zajko. They found her at the Coventry property, along with the 24-year-old Daniel Blank‚Äîthe rationalist from Berkeley who had once delivered court documents for Alex Leatham.\nOne of the troopers, Matthew Gibson, later testified that Zajko told them she was ‚Äúuncertain of when she would come back to the Commonwealth in order to make final arrangements for her parents.‚Äù According to the search warrant affidavit, she told the troopers she hadn‚Äôt spoken to her parents since the previous January, that she‚Äôd been in Vermont with Blank on New Year‚Äôs Eve, and that she hadn‚Äôt been to Pennsylvania since before the Covid pandemic.\nThe officers asked Zajko if she had any guns on the property. She said they did, and retrieved a 9mm Smith & Wesson. Gibson testified that he ‚Äúheld it in Vermont‚Äù and ‚Äúinspected it.‚Äù Two sources also confirmed to me that the troopers had seen a shooting range on the property and that the Pennsylvania State Police had discovered that Zajko and the others had turned their phones off in the hours leading up to the murder, making it difficult to track their whereabouts. With no warrant to confiscate the gun, however, Gibson handed it back, and the officers returned home.\nOn January 9, the Pennsylvania State Police got a call from the medical examiner in Delaware County. Zajko had arrived unexpectedly, seeking death certificates for her parents. The police tracked her to a nearby hotel called Candlewood Suites, but waited to approach her again.\nOn the morning of January 12, Michelle arrived alone at the small graveside ceremony for her parents. Wearing a mask, she told Rosanne she‚Äôd been ill and didn‚Äôt want to spread germs. Rosanne recalls her seeming paranoid, gesturing at some of Rick‚Äôs former colleagues she didn‚Äôt recognize. ‚ÄúWho are those men?‚Äù she asked.\nThen, at 9 pm that evening, the police arrived at the hotel. They‚Äôd secured a warrant to obtain Zajko‚Äôs DNA and search her hotel room and car for the Smith & Wesson‚Äî‚Äúbelieved to potentially be the murder weapon of Richard and Rita Zajko,‚Äù Gibson testified.\nWhen Zajko came to the door of her second-floor room, she acknowledged the officers but was slow to open it. The police used a key card to enter. They detained Zajko and took her down to the lobby, but as they passed through, she shouted at the hotel staff to tell Daniel Blank that she‚Äôd been arrested. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs staying in room 111!‚Äù she said, according to Gibson. The trooper recognized Blank‚Äôs name from the Vermont trip and gathered some officers to approach 111, which Blank had rented under the name ‚ÄúDaniel Black.‚Äù When Gibson knocked on the door, Blank refused to open it and asked for a lawyer.\nInstead, the officers left to obtain a warrant. They reviewed the previous night‚Äôs footage from the Candlewood Suites security cameras and determined that Zajko had carried a bag down to room 111, knocked, and left it outside the door. A judge found it sufficient probable cause for a warrant, and the police returned to the hotel at 12:30 am. This time, when no one answered the door to 111, a vice unit breached the room. They heard the shower running and found Blank hiding in the bathroom‚Äîalong with a blond-haired figure they hadn‚Äôt expected, dressed in black.\nBlank was thrown to the ground and cuffed, but cooperated as he was walked out of the room. The other person in the room, whom troopers would later describe as being 6' 2\" and 200 pounds, was sprawled on the bathroom floor with eyes closed. ‚ÄúHe was just laying almost unconscious or as if he was dead on the ground,‚Äù another trooper, Matthew Smith, later testified. Four officers carried this other figure out of the room. In the lobby, a trooper physically placed the person‚Äôs finger onto a mobile fingerprint scanner.\nA hit came up for an open warrant, in California. It was for Ziz LaSota, under her birth name.\nThe troopers sent LaSota to the hospital, where doctors said there seemed to be nothing wrong with her. She was placed under arrest, then charged with disorderly conduct and interfering with a police investigation.\nThe troopers searched Zajko‚Äôs green 2013 Subaru, parked at the hotel, and discovered $40,000 in cash under the front passenger seat. In Blank‚Äôs pocket they found a receipt for it, from a Bank of America branch in Vermont. (Later, surveillance footage from the branch would show Blank pacing back and forth as he awaited the money, then pulling out and unwrapping a cell phone covered in foil.)\nIn LaSota and Blank‚Äôs room, 111, the police found a light-colored cloth bag containing a Smith & Wesson 9mm‚Äîwith a serial number matching the one troopers had seen in Vermont‚Äîand five boxes of ammunition.\nBy that point, however, Blank and Zajko had been released. They never came back for the cash or the car. Only LaSota remained in custody.\nXI.\nI started attending LaSota‚Äôs court hearings in May 2023, at a columned Pennsylvania courthouse in the town center of Media, just over five miles from Zajko‚Äôs childhood home. Eighteen weeks after her arrest, LaSota remained in jail, a judge having initially set bail at $500,000‚Äîan inconceivable amount for two misdemeanors‚Äîbefore reducing it to $50,000. On an early May morning in Judge Richard Cappelli‚Äôs courtroom, between a litany of DUIs and petty drug crimes, the clerk called the case.\nLaSota appeared by video‚Äîthere‚Äôd been a snafu with the prisoner-transportation system from the jail‚Äîbut I couldn‚Äôt see her face from where I was sitting in the gallery. Representing her in the courtroom was Daniel McGarrigle, an attorney with slicked-back gray hair and a trim beard. He‚Äôd come prepared to argue that the charges should be dismissed. The police hadn‚Äôt come to Candlewood Suites to arrest or even investigate LaSota, he noted to me later, and closing one‚Äôs eyes and lying on the floor was hardly typical ‚Äúdisorderly conduct.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnnoying or frustrating the police is not a crime,‚Äù McGarrigle told me. As for the murders, he said, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt speak to rumors. I only speak to evidence. The evidence I‚Äôve seen so far‚Äîthat the Commonwealth has presented so far‚Äîhas shown me that my client is not guilty of any crime in Pennsylvania.‚Äù\nOn this morning, though, Cappelli adjourned the hearing until a date when the defendant could be transported to the courtroom. LaSota responded bitterly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here for four months,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwhich I think is even longer than the suggested sentence. It‚Äôs me languishing in jail for another week for no reason, so I‚Äôm not going to say I agree with it.‚Äù\nA few weeks later, LaSota finally appeared in person, in a forest green jumpsuit and handcuffs, her unkempt blond hair swept partly across her face and below her shoulders. She was wearing a blue surgical mask and sat rigidly still through the hearing, where the state would put on evidence to counter McGarrigle‚Äôs motion to quash the charges. Unlike the California courts, which made the occasional pretense of acknowledging the Zizians‚Äô chosen genders, in Pennsylvania LaSota was only ‚Äúhe.‚Äù After testimony from troopers Gibson and Smith about the events at the Candlewood Suites, the prosecutor argued that LaSota had ‚Äúrecklessly created a risk and a hazardous condition to the troopers that had to physically remove a 6' 2\", 200-pound man.‚Äù\nBehind these arguments, and even the charges themselves, lay a deeper motive: Unable to charge for the Zajko murders but suspecting that LaSota, Michelle Zajko, and Daniel Blank could be tied to them, prosecutors were trying desperately to hold LaSota while the police gathered evidence. ‚ÄúObviously you realize we don't give a shit about this case,‚Äù one local official familiar with it told me. What they were interested in was LaSota‚Äôs involvement in the homicide.\nOnce out of jail, LaSota would be ‚Äúin the wind,‚Äù the official said. Authorities wouldn‚Äôt see LaSota again until she resurfaced ‚Äúin somebody else's prison.‚Äù\nBut from another angle, the authorities seemed oddly passive about what already amounted to a kind of alleged crime spree. LaSota had an active bench warrant in Sonoma County, California, on the felony charge related to the protest. She‚Äôd arguably committed another crime in faking her death, since causing the Coast Guard to commit resources to save lives when no one is in danger is a federal felony‚Äîpunishable by up to six years in prison. And according to the police in Vallejo, she‚Äôd fled the scene of the sword attack and shooting, making her at minimum a potential person of interest in a murder case. But no California law enforcement showed up in Pennsylvania looking to collect their charge or even to question her.\nEven more strangely, perhaps, despite having found the Smith & Wesson in LaSota and Blank‚Äôs hotel room, prosecutors never charged her in connection to the weapon. Under Pennsylvania law, it‚Äôs illegal to possess a gun while a fugitive from justice. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that the charges would have had legs,‚Äù the official told me, since the gun could have belonged to Blank. But in the court hearings on LaSota‚Äôs bail, the discovery of the gun never even came up.\nThe only person I‚Äôd seen in the gallery who seemed tuned into the hearings was a beefy fifty- or sixtysomething white-haired man, sporting a goatee and wearing a black polo. He gave off the vibe of a private investigator, and when I introduced myself he confirmed as much, declining to give his name. ‚ÄúYou can call me ‚Ä¶ Cliff,‚Äù he said, unconvincingly. We shared our bafflement at $500,000-to-$50,000 bail, and I asked why he was there. ‚ÄúSome people in California are interested in this case,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre afraid of this individual.‚Äù\nThat fear was evident among some rationalists as news of the violent incidents surrounding LaSota had spread. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want Ziz to ever think about me, ever,‚Äù a person involved in the Bay Area rationalist community said in an interview in 2023. ‚ÄúI think I know enough to be correctly scared of Ziz.‚Äù\nThat June, Judge Cappelli ruled against quashing the charges but reduced LaSota‚Äôs bail to $10,000, unsecured‚Äîmeaning LaSota could sign a payment pledge and walk out. McGarrigle informed the court that LaSota‚Äôs mother had flown in from Alaska, ‚Äúand she will take him home and make sure he comes back for all the court dates.‚Äù The prosecutor seemed skeptical. ‚ÄúThe Commonwealth‚Äôs concern is the flight,‚Äù he told the judge. ‚ÄúThere is literally zero ties to the community.‚Äù What were the odds LaSota would show up for the next court date, in late August?\nAround the same time, Michelle Zajko called her aunt Rosanne. They hadn‚Äôt spoken since the graveside service for Michelle‚Äôs parents that January. She hadn‚Äôt shown up at the memorial mass where Rosanne had eulogized Rita and Rick. But now Michelle was calling with a message: ‚ÄúShe told me she wasn‚Äôt responsible‚Äù for the murders, Rosanne said. ‚ÄúBut she said that she knew who was.‚Äù She told her aunt that ‚ÄúLessWrong did it‚Äù and that she was ‚Äúbeing targeted.‚Äù\nNot long after, the trust that owned the house in Coventry, Vermont, where Michelle had lived with Alice Monday, sold it off. Michelle and Blank were both gone, having left the previous winter. When realtors came to inspect the property, they found the house had not been winterized, causing the pipes to burst. One of Blank‚Äôs family members, meanwhile, filed a national missing persons report, noting that he had last been seen in Pennsylvania, wore thick glasses, and had one eye that didn‚Äôt follow the other.\nWhen LaSota‚Äôs court appearance came, on the morning of August 21, 2023, the courtroom gallery was full of defendants waiting to be called for the day‚Äôs pleas. Shortly after court was gaveled into session, an older woman with gray-blond hair pushed a wheelchair into the back of the courtroom. In it, slumped to one side and dressed in flowing black, was LaSota. Now her hair too was black and appeared even more disheveled than when she‚Äôd been in jail. She was wearing what appeared to be an industrial N95 respirator mask, with valves on either side. McGarrigle, approaching his client in the back of the courtroom, seemed surprised. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù he said, leaning in. ‚ÄúI mean, what‚Äôs going on with your health?‚Äù\nWhen LaSota‚Äôs case was called, the woman I later learned was LaSota‚Äôs mother wheeled her to the front, where she sat impassively in the chair, gazing blankly at the floor.\nA new prosecutor had replaced the old one, and requested a continuance to get on top of all the facts. The judge assented, pushing the trial to December. ‚ÄúI just want the record to reflect that the defendant is here, and we‚Äôre ready,‚Äù McGarrigle said, before LaSota‚Äôs mother wheeled her back out through the doors.\nXII.\nTwo months later, I traveled to Sonoma County, the home of Westminster Woods and the scene of the protest that had seemingly begun this great unraveling. I met Sergeant Brian Parks at the local Starbucks. After hearing his account of the original arrests, I asked him why‚Äîgiven the open felony warrant‚Äîhis department hadn‚Äôt come after LaSota once she was arrested in Pennsylvania. ‚ÄúRight now, if I were to look at the system, there are probably 75 felony bench warrants,‚Äù Parks said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the luxury of trying to serve‚Äù them all, he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre understaffed right now.‚Äù\nI told him what I‚Äôd heard in Pennsylvania from a source close to the case, that the authorities there had contacted Sonoma County about taking their prisoner. ‚ÄúI heard there was some communication between us and the agency in Pennsylvania,‚Äù Parks said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know to what extent, so I really don‚Äôt want to comment on that.‚Äù\nBut did it frustrate him, I asked, that the original case felt like it would never get prosecuted? ‚ÄúI personally am not going to lose sleep over this matter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf they were here and running amok still, or running amok anywhere in the United States, causing concern for other agencies and people of our communities, then yeah, I‚Äôd want them prosecuted.‚Äù\nThe next day, I drove to Vallejo. I‚Äôd arranged to meet Curtis Lind at the property where he had lost his eye and where Emma Borhanian had been killed. It remained scattered with containers and trailers, and a friend of Lind‚Äôs had told me there were still tenants living there. I‚Äôd talked to Lind briefly the day before. But that morning I got a call from another friend of Lind‚Äôs who said he‚Äôd changed his mind. He didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúsay anything that would change the case,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúOr would make them come after him again.‚Äù\nThe murder cases against Alex Leatham and Suri Dao, meanwhile, had sunk into a seemingly endless quagmire. To the distress of Leatham and her family, she was being housed in a men‚Äôs jail despite demanding to be placed in a women‚Äôs. And to the bafflement of Dao‚Äôs lawyers, Dao demanded to be placed in a men‚Äôs lockup after being assigned to a women‚Äôs. In the year since their arrest, both had been accused by prosecutors of escape attempts. Back in late 2022, at the hospital following her gunshot wounds, Leatham had allegedly pretended to be asleep on a bench, and when the deputy guarding her had gone to the bathroom, managed to shuffle to an exit in leg shackles. She was captured 20 feet outside the door. She‚Äôd allegedly tried again outside a February hearing, requesting a wheelchair and then running for it, getting as far as a nearby fence. Dao, in the summer of 2023, had allegedly faked a seizure in a cell, then tried to run past the guards. According to the incident report, Dao had injured a hand trying to prevent the guards from shutting the door, then ‚Äúbanged her head on the cell window‚Äù while waiting for an ambulance.\nBoth defendants‚Äô lawyers argued that their clients were mentally incompetent to stand trial. This despite Leatham‚Äôs objecting to having a lawyer at all, much less being declared insane. In her letters to the judge and outbursts in court, she insisted her thinking was not only sane but logical. ‚ÄúMy coercively assigned council do not represent me,‚Äù she wrote in July of 2023. ‚ÄúI am rational. I do not have a ‚Äòmental illness‚Äô and I do not need ‚Äòtreatment.‚Äô‚Äù\nIn some way, it felt like the theories that LaSota and Danielson had first spun up on their one-tug Rationalist Fleet were crashing into the messy reality of the justice system. Writing to the court, Leatham offered a rationalist-like case for her own rationality. ‚ÄúYesterday I believed different things than I do today and tomorrow my beliefs about the world will change again. Yet I still complete plans I made yesterday,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúEverything I have said before the court is the truth according to the epistemic state I was in when I said it.‚Äù\nThe judge disagreed. Based on testimony of doctors, he ruled that Leatham was ‚Äúdevelopmentally disabled and incapable of cooperating with counsel in the conduct of their defense, and understanding the nature and purpose of the proceedings now pending against them.‚Äù Leatham was committed to a mental health facility in Porterville, California, for a maximum of four years. Leatham would only go to trial if the facility, and then the judge, determined she‚Äôd returned to fitness.\nIn August 2023, Dao's attorneys asked that the criminal proceedings be suspended, believing that Dao was incompetent to stand trial. In a filing to the court, they wrote that their client had been suffering from depression, psychosis, and suicidal thoughts since the termination of their hormone therapy and had begun engaging in ‚Äúself-mutilation.‚Äù Dao, they told the court, ‚Äúwill not speak to attorneys, doctors, the court, or anyone else,‚Äù ‚Äúlacks awareness of court proceedings,‚Äù and ‚Äúappears mentally vacant, incognizant, and to be suffering from some type of dissociative identity disorder.‚Äù Dao‚Äôs own attorneys also cited ‚Äútransgender issues‚Äù‚Äîincluding their client‚Äôs wish to be referred to as ‚Äúthey‚Äù and placed in a men‚Äôs jail‚Äîas an ‚Äúobjective manifestation‚Äù of Dao‚Äôs incompetence. The case remained bogged down in mental health evaluations and hospital stays, and as 2023 bled into 2024 neither Leatham nor Dao was any closer to going to trial in California.\nXIII.\nOn the morning of LaSota‚Äôs rescheduled trial in Pennsylvania four months later, Judge Cappelli plowed through a half dozen cases before calling CR-962-23. The prosecutor and LaSota‚Äôs defense attorney Daniel McGarrigle strode to the bench. But no wheelchair rolled into the room. LaSota and her mother were nowhere to be found in the gallery.\n‚ÄúGood morning, your honor,‚Äù McGarrigle said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready for trial. I have not had contact with my client since the last time we were here.‚Äù In those four months, he‚Äôd spoken to LaSota‚Äôs family, he said, but not LaSota directly, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm unable to provide an update on my client‚Äôs whereabouts at this time.‚Äù\nThe judge gave McGarrigle until the following morning to reach his client. When he couldn‚Äôt, the court issued a bench warrant for LaSota‚Äôs arrest. As of December 2023, Ziz LaSota, wanted in two states, was officially in the wind.\nXIV.\nMany years ago, a thought experiment emerged out of the rationalist community called ‚ÄúRoko‚Äôs basilisk.‚Äù First posed on LessWrong by a user named Roko in 2010‚Äîand named for a mythical reptile that can kill with its glance‚Äîthe premise loosely stated is this: If and when superintelligent AI emerges in the future, capable of dominating and subjugating humans, it will be inclined to punish those who tried to prevent it from coming into existence. Indeed, this superintelligent overlord may be inclined to punish even those who failed to spend their lives working to bring it into existence. If you knew that artificial superintelligence was possible, the thinking goes, yet still didn‚Äôt devote your life to helping create it, it may subject you to unfathomable torture for that choice.\nRoko‚Äôs basilisk contained within it two insidious and mind-bending premises. The first was that merely being aware of the thought experiment instantly made you its potential victim. In the language of the rationalist community, it was an ‚Äúinfohazard.‚Äù The second was the implication that an entity from the future‚Äîone that didn‚Äôt yet exist, and perhaps never would‚Äîcould somehow blackmail people in the present to help bring about its existence. ‚ÄúWork for my benefit,‚Äù the future AI would be telling us, ‚Äúor I will subject you to unimaginable pain.‚Äù The idea so roiled the community that Eliezer Yudkowsky, the cofounder of LessWrong, banned mention of it from the forum entirely.\nWhen Ziz LaSota first encountered Roko‚Äôs basilisk in the mid-2010s, in her early years among the rationalists, she was inclined to dismiss it. Yudkowsky had by then declared that its premise was unfounded‚Äî‚Äúthere‚Äôs no incentive for a future agent to follow through with the threat,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúbecause by doing so it just expends resources at no gain to itself.‚Äù He‚Äôd even un-banned it from LessWrong. But still, LaSota later wrote, ‚ÄúI started encountering people who were freaked out by it, freaked out they had discovered an ‚Äòimprovement‚Äô to the infohazard that made it function, got around Eliezer‚Äôs objection.‚Äù\nFor a while she was able to dismiss these ‚Äúimprovements.‚Äù But the more she thought about Roko‚Äôs basilisk, the more she began to suffer from ‚Äúintrusive thoughts about basilisks‚Äù‚Äînot just Roko‚Äôs but others which she could never name. ‚ÄúEventually I came to believe, in the gaps of frantically trying not to think about it,‚Äù she wrote, ‚Äúthat if I persisted in trying to save the world, I would be tortured until the end of the universe by a coalition of all unfriendly AIs.‚Äù\nUpon discovering that her actions might lead to infinite torture and then examining her own resolve, LaSota was surprised to find that it held. She refused to be blackmailed, she concluded, by what might come. ‚ÄúEvil gods must be fought,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúIf this damns me then so be it.‚Äù\nThe more time I spent following the group that some called the Zizians, the more their story started seeming itself like some kind of basilisk. Just by virtue of having examined its events, you were trapped in its world, subject to its terms. Inside that world it felt like some future evil was rapidly approaching, ominous events waiting just beyond the horizon. But speaking of them could usher them faster, closer. I was certain the story as I understood it was incomplete but unsure where to look to complete it. Or if I did, whether I could tell it without attracting the basilisk‚Äôs gaze myself.\nSo I set the story aside, and waited.\nXV.\nOn January 14 of this year, authorities got a call from a hotel employee near Lyndonville, Vermont, about 30 miles from Michelle Zajko's old place in Coventry. Two people had checked in wearing ‚Äúall-black tactical-style clothing with protective equipment,‚Äù the employee said, according to court documents. One was carrying a gun, in a visible holster. (Open carry of firearms is legal in Vermont.) Agents from Homeland Security accompanied the Vermont State Police in responding to the call, and they ‚Äúattempted to initiate a consensual conversation‚Äù with the black-clad guests. The pair‚ÄîTeresa Youngblut and Ophelia Bauckholt‚Äîsaid they had come to the area to look for property but declined to elaborate. They checked out that same day and relocated to nearby Newport. The police, meanwhile, kept them under sporadic surveillance.\nTwo days later, on the opposite coast, it appeared the trials of Leatham and Dao were, at long last, going forward. They‚Äôd both been declared competent, and in August, Curtis Lind had provided a long videotaped account of his version of events to prosecutors. Now, on January 16, in anticipation of a spring trial date, prosecutors filed a motion noting that ‚ÄúMr. Lind is the only eye-witness to this case and his testimony is critical for the People to have the ability to prove their case.‚Äù\nLind, now 82, had put the Vallejo land up for sale after the incident and even received an all-cash offer of $300,000. But he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to sell. He‚Äôd cleared off the tenants and the junk, but somehow over time both had drifted back. ‚ÄúHe was there every day,‚Äù one friend said, commuting more than an hour in each direction from Half Moon Bay. ‚ÄúFor what? Just puttering around, from what I saw.‚Äù\nLind still worried about someone taking vengeance for the attack, the friend said. ‚ÄúHe mentioned a few times that they might come back and finish the job. He was, like, a wait-and-see character. Well, we‚Äôll wait and see what happens, you know?‚Äù\nJanuary 17 was a clear, chilly day at the property. Lind was walking on Lemon Street, one block away, when a man wearing a black beanie, a mask, and a purple shirt emerged from hiding. The attacker approached Lind, put an arm around his neck, and began to stab him in the chest. Before fleeing, the man slit Lind‚Äôs throat. When the police arrived, they found Lind unresponsive but still alive. He died at the hospital within the hour.\nOn January 19, in downtown Newport, Vermont, the law enforcement agents who had Youngblut and Bauckholt under ‚Äúperiodic surveillance‚Äù spotted them again in the same tactical gear, gun included. The next day, agents observed the pair at Walmart, where Bauckholt bought two boxes of aluminum foil. The agents saw Bauckholt wrapping two items in the foil, which would later turn out to be cell phones. Bauckholt made a call from another phone, and then the duo left, driving a blue Toyota Prius hatchback with North Carolina plates.\nThe Homeland Security agents had determined‚Äîwrongly, as it turned out‚Äîthat Bauckholt, a German citizen, had an expired visa. So as the pair was driving down Interstate 91, three Border Patrol vehicles flipped on their lights and pulled the car over. According to federal prosecutors, Youngblut stepped out from the driver‚Äôs seat, pulled out a Glock handgun, and fired at the agents, who began firing back. Bauckholt tried to draw a gun too. In the exchange, a Border Patrol agent named David ‚ÄúChris‚Äù Maland was killed, along with Bauckholt. Youngblut was shot but alive, transported to a local hospital.\nSeveral days later in Redding, California, the police arrested 22-year-old Maximilian Snyder and charged him with Curtis Lind‚Äôs murder. Snyder, a Seattle-area native, had attended the prestigious private Lakeside School before obtaining a computer science and philosophy degree from Oxford. ‚ÄúI would like to help advance the technological frontier of humanity in a responsible manner,‚Äù he‚Äôd written on his LinkedIn, ‚Äúby contributing original research in the fields of artificial general intelligence and AI alignment.‚Äù\nWhile the murder of Lind might have remained a regional story, the killing of Maland‚Äîa 44-year-old US Air Force veteran and a nine-year member of the Border Patrol‚Äîwas quickly national news. But it was local reporters who began to piece together the alleged connections, starting in Vermont. The regional news outlet VT Digger reported that a federal filing in Youngblut‚Äôs case indicated that the person who allegedly purchased both guns for the duo was ‚Äúa person of interest‚Äù in a double murder in Pennsylvania who had lived near Coventry. They didn‚Äôt give the person‚Äôs name, but as soon as I saw it I knew: Michelle Zajko.\nThe same filing argued that Youngblut, who was charged with forcible assault with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm, should be detained while awaiting trial. Prosecutors noted that both Youngblut and Zajko ‚Äúare acquainted with and have been in frequent contact with an individual who was detained by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania during that homicide investigation; that individual is also a person of interest in a homicide investigation in Vallejo, California.‚Äù The facts fit Ziz LaSota.\nReporters in Vallejo and Seattle uncovered a marriage license application between Snyder and Youngblut, who‚Äôd also attended Lakeside. Both were known in rationalist and effective altruist circles, as was Bauckholt. Bauckholt had been a quant trader who‚Äôd worked in New York and interned at Jane Street Capital, the same firm that once employed Sam Bankman-Fried. They were all young, technically gifted strivers, and their involvement summoned the kind of shocked responses that echoed those elicited by Borhanian and Leatham years before. ‚ÄúShe seemed like a friendly nerd,‚Äù one friend of Bauckholt‚Äôs from the rationalist community told me. ‚ÄúShe was very into math and hosted some community discussion channels on Discord. I never knew she knew Ziz at all.‚Äù Youngblut, who‚Äôd gone on to study computer science at the University of Washington, ‚Äúwas rather quiet, reserved,‚Äù a high school classmate of both Youngblut‚Äôs and Snyder‚Äôs recalled. ‚ÄúShe seemed incredibly harmless.‚Äù Her family, similar to Daniel Blank‚Äôs, had attempted to file a missing person‚Äôs report for her months before. Snyder, by contrast, could come off as ‚Äúmacho‚Äù or ‚Äúobnoxious,‚Äù the classmate said. ‚ÄúIt's shocking to even imagine the two of them, like, interacting, let alone interacting deeply enough to pursue a marriage certificate.‚Äù\nSoon the national and international media was flooding in, trying to understand who and what the ‚ÄúZizians‚Äù were. A ‚Äútrans vegan death cult‚Äù? An ‚Äúoffshoot of the rationalist movement‚Äù? An ‚Äúantifascist cult‚Äù? Anarchists? The events were immediately sucked up into the maw of the culture-war machine, recycled as a story of wokeness gone wild, a story of police overreach, an immigration story, or one about the inevitable product of an anti-trans culture.\nIn early February, Snyder dictated a 1,500-word letter to reporters at the San Francisco Chronicle, which the paper printed in full. In it, Snyder opened by saying, ‚ÄúI am not one of Ziz‚Äôs friends,‚Äù implicitly disclaiming the group‚Äôs involvement in his alleged killing of the lone witness in their upcoming murder trial. He spent the rest of the statement addressing Eliezer Yudkowsky, half lecturing, half pleading with him to accept that animals are people, and bragging about his D&D skills.\nBesides LaSota, Blank, and Zajko, it‚Äôs unclear whether there might be other adherents to LaSota‚Äôs ideas still at large, directly connected to the group or not. Gwen Danielson‚Äôs father recently told the Chronicle that rumors of her suicide were false. He‚Äôd spoken to her in recent months, he said. She had split from the group and was ‚Äúcompletely under the radar.‚Äù As for LaSota, the Associated Press reported that she‚Äôd been last spotted by the landlord of a North Carolina Airbnb as recently as December, seemingly staying with Youngblut and Bauckholt at a pair of condos where the group kept a box truck parked outside.\nThen, last Sunday afternoon, near the town of Frostburg in western Maryland, not far from the Pennsylvania border, a man saw a pair of white box trucks parked up a dirt road on his property. In and around them he found three people, dressed all in black. They asked if he would let them camp on the property for a month. Instead, he called the police, saying that he recognized the group from news reports.\nA pair of Maryland State Troopers and units from the local Sheriff's Office responded. According to a criminal complaint, the lead trooper, Brandon Jeffries, first spotted Daniel Blank, seated in the cab of one of the trucks. When Jeffries ordered him to show his hands, Blank responded that he had a learning disability and couldn‚Äôt understand.\nWhile another trooper covered Blank, Jeffries and the Sheriff‚Äôs deputies approached the other truck, where Jeffries had seen a figure wiping fog from the window. When they pulled open the back door, they found LaSota and Zajko, both wearing ammo belts. The pair fled to the cab through an inner doorway, then refused to exit the truck. At Lasota‚Äôs feet was a handgun. Zajko ‚Äúwas crying,‚Äù Jeffries wrote in the complaint, ‚Äúsaying not to kill her.‚Äù The pair wouldn‚Äôt give their names, and after Zajko tucked her hands into her armpits, the police took her to the ground. When they did, an officer found another handgun, loaded with 12 rounds, tucked into her waistband.\nAll three were arrested for trespassing and obstructing an officer. Zajko was charged with possession of the handgun, LaSota for transporting another gun found in the vehicle. In their new booking photos, compared to their last public images, Zajko now had close-cropped hair, and Blank seemed to have put on weight. But LaSota, with her long sandy-blond hair, looked strikingly similar to how she had five years before, when she was arrested at Westminster Woods.\nOn Tuesday, they were ordered held without bail until a hearing in March. The same day, federal prosecutors in Vermont charged Michelle with providing a false address when she purchased two of the guns used in the Border Patrol shootout.\nXVI.\nIn the wake of the January 2025 murders and the ensuing media maelstrom, many in the rationalist community turned, as they always had, to the pseudonymous safety of LessWrong. There they tried to make sense of what happened, worried over how the public would now view them and their causes, and warned each other against speaking to journalists. One poster suggested, tentatively, that whatever the ‚ÄúZizians‚Äù were, or are, might be the product of seeing the world too starkly through rationalist eyes. ‚ÄúI haven't seen others on LW with this sentiment, maybe they've felt afraid to express it (as I do),‚Äù the person wrote. ‚ÄúThey were alienated altruists who couldn't handle this world and seemingly went a little insane. (given the incorrect beliefs about decision theory). Most people struggle to stay dispassionately rational when faced with something which they regard as very morally bad. It is hard to live in a world one believes to contain atrocities.‚Äù\nThe MIRI, CFAR, EA triumvirate promised not just that you could be the hero of your own story but that your heroism could be deployed in the service of saving humanity itself from certain destruction. Is it so surprising that this promise attracted people who were not prepared to be bit players in group housing dramas and abstract technical papers? That they might come to believe, perhaps in the throes of their own mental health struggles, that saving the world required a different kind of action‚Äîby them, specifically, and no one else?\nTo Rosanne Zajko, whose family had actually suffered atrocities difficult to comprehend, each revelation leading up to Michelle‚Äôs arrest, and each day without a resolution, had been like a new wound. She‚Äôd wanted to see her niece caught, she said. But whatever the legal system produced would never constitute a complete explanation. ‚ÄúShe's a smart person, and she's a logical person,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand this kind of behavior does not sound smart or logical to me.‚Äù\nLogic. Rationality. Intelligence. Somewhere in all these attempts to harness them for our shared humanity, they‚Äôd been warped and twisted to destroy it.\nOne of the last things LaSota seems to have written for public consumption was a comment she left on her own blog in July 2022, one month before she supposedly went overboard in San Francisco Bay. ‚ÄúStatists come threaten me to snitch whatever info I have on their latest missing persons,‚Äù she wrote, seemingly referring to deaths by suicide that had already happened among those who‚Äôd embraced her ideas. ‚ÄúDid I strike them down in a horrific act of bloody vengeance? Did I drive them to suicide by whistling komm susser tod?‚Äù‚Äîa German phrase that translates as ‚Äúcome, sweet death.‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe they died in a series of experimental brain surgeries that I performed without anesthetic since that‚Äôs against my religion, in an improvised medical facility?‚Äù\nBelow it was pasted a stock photo of two people wearing shirts that read, ‚ÄúI can neither confirm nor deny.‚Äù\nA few hours later, she offered up another thought. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust anyone over 30,‚Äù she wrote, ‚Äúwith a kill count of 0.‚Äù\nUpdated February 24, 2025, at 11:00 am EDT: This story was updated to clarify the county to where the Caleb was towed, and adding context to a detail of LaSota's writings.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

With the help of a helicopter, the police spent hours searching the 200-acre complex for the fifth, armed protester. In the end, there wasn't one. ‚ÄúWe later learned that it was actually a maintenance worker who had armed himself with the hatchet,‚Äù Parks says. The original reports of protesters carrying weapons had also been false. One had a can of pepper spray, but none of them had a gun.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The four were transported, handcuffed, to a detention facility in nearby Santa Rosa. Both sides would agree on one final fact: that the protesters refused to cooperate, in any sense. ‚ÄúI know your face!‚Äù one said to the officers as they were bundled into the facility. ‚ÄúYou are slavers.

At the jail, though, the clash between the police and the protesters somehow set in motion a story that would end with one demonstrator dead, one missing, one detained, and one on trial for murder.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The four protesters‚ÄîEmma Borhanian, Gwen Danielson, Ziz LaSota, and Alex Leatham‚Äîhad all been involved in various ways with the CFAR, MIRI, and EA communities. But they had refused to give their names to the cops, who eventually used fingerprints to identify them. This meant that in early stories about the arrests, LaSota and Leatham were deadnamed‚Äîidentified by their birth names rather than their chosen ones.</p><p class=\"paywall\">To the Sheriff's Office this may have seemed a minor oversight, even an unavoidable one. These were, after all, the names the fingerprints had turned up. But it represented the first crack in what would become a rhetorical and factual fissure between the official narrative and that of the protesters. They would be routinely deadnamed in court documents and proceedings, and even by their own attorneys in conversations with me. (In this story, wherever possible, I'm using their given family names, which none officially changed to my knowledge, and their chosen first names and pronouns, as far as I can discern from their own statements and the blogs I've established that they maintained. However, I do at times quote public officials and records that refer to trans people by the pronouns they were assigned at birth.)</p><p class=\"paywall\">To the extent that the group had any coherent collective identity, they would come to be known in the rationalist community as ‚Äúthe Zizians.‚Äù To the extent they had a leader, it would be perceived as Ziz LaSota. The members of the group never seemed to adopt this name themselves, nor would they accept its implications: that they were a group at all, that they had a leader. But to the people they‚Äôd splintered off from, it appeared that all troubles flowed back to LaSota.</p><aside aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"PullQuoteEmbedWrapper-sc-TKIUW iXNYkj\" data-testid=\"pullquote-embed\"><p class=\"PullQuoteDecorativeBorder-sc-jjUCxa doQAAR\"></p><div class=\"PullQuoteEmbedContent-sc-lixSTo fIFzPG\"><p class=\"paywall\">They became consumed with the struggle to keep the vessel seaworthy. Marooned for days and weeks onboard, pondering their deteriorating surroundings, they began creating their own unique philosophies.</p></div></aside><p class=\"paywall\">LaSota was a 28-year-old software developer who had grown up in Alaska. By her own description, she was technically gifted from a young age. ‚ÄúMy friends and family, even if they think I'm weird, don't seem to be really bothered by the fact that I'm weird,‚Äù she wrote in 2014, in the comments of a post on LessWrong.com, the online forum that serves as a discussion hub for rationalist thought. ‚ÄúBut one thing I can tell you is that I used to de-emphasize my weirdness around them, and then I stopped, and found that being unapologetically weird is a lot more fun.‚Äù</p><p class=\"paywall\">LaSota began ‚Äúreading up on EA and x-risk,‚Äù she wrote later, as an undergraduate in computer engineering at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. That‚Äôs also when she was ‚Äústarting to donate to MIRI.‚Äù She interned at the software giant Oracle and at NASA, developing a tool for space weather analysis. But around the time she graduated, she began to wonder whether she should commit to graduate school in computer science or pursue a job as a computer engineer and ‚Äúearn to give‚Äù‚Äîthe effective altruism term for making as much money as possible in order to donate it. (The concept is now most attached to convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried, but at the time it was still novel, as the EA movement took off in the Bay Area.)</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Sweeping layoffs architected by the Trump administration and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency may be coming as soon as this week at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a nonregulatory agency responsible for establishing benchmarks that ensure everything from beauty products to quantum computers are safe and reliable.\nAccording to several current and former employees at NIST, the agency has been bracing for cuts since President Donald Trump took office last month and ordered billionaire Elon Musk and DOGE to slash spending across the federal government. The fears were heightened last week when some NIST workers witnessed a handful of people they believed to be associated with DOGE inside Building 225, which houses the NIST Information Technology Laboratory at the agency‚Äôs Gaithersburg, Maryland, campus, according to multiple people briefed on the sightings. The DOGE staff were seeking access to NIST‚Äôs IT systems, one of the people said.\nSoon after the purported visit, NIST leadership told employees that DOGE staffers were not currently on campus, but that office space and technology were being provisioned for them, according to the same people.\nOn Wednesday, Axios and Bloomberg reported that NIST had begun informing some employees that they could soon be laid off. About 500 recent hires who are still in probationary status and can be let go more easily were among those expected to be affected, according to the reports. Three sources tell WIRED that the cuts likely impact lauded technical experts in leadership positions, including three lab directors who were promoted within the last year. One person familiar with the agency tells WIRED that the official layoff notices may come Friday.\nThe White House and a spokesperson for NIST, which is part of the Department of Commerce, did not yet return requests for comment.\nOne NIST team that has been fearing cuts because of its number of probationary employees is the US AI Safety Institute (AISI), which was created after former President Joe Biden‚Äôs sweeping executive order on AI issued in October 2023. Trump rescinded the order shortly after taking office last month, describing it as a ‚Äúbarrier to American leadership in artificial intelligence.‚Äù\nThe AI Safety Institute and its roughly two dozen staffers have been working closely with AI companies, including rivals to Musk‚Äôs startup xAI like OpenAI and Anthropic, to understand and test the capabilities of their most powerful models. Musk was an early investor in OpenAI and is currently suing the startup over its decision to transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation.\nAISI‚Äôs inaugural director, Elizabeth Kelly, announced she was leaving her role earlier this month. Several other high-profile NIST leaders working on AI have also departed in recent weeks, including Reva Schwartz, who led NIST‚Äôs Assessing Risks and Impacts of AI program, and Elham Tabassi, NIST‚Äôs chief AI adviser. Kelly and Schwartz declined to comment. Tabassi did not respond to a request for comment.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at wak.01, peard33.24, and leahfeiger.86.\nUS vice president JD Vance recently signaled the new administration‚Äôs intent to deprioritize AI safety at the AI Action Summit, a major international meeting held in Paris last week that AISI and other government staffers were not invited to attend, according to three familiar with the matter. ‚ÄúI'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety,‚Äù Vance said in his first major speech as VP. ‚ÄúI'm here to talk about AI opportunity.‚Äù\nThough they receive bipartisan support, the AI Safety Institute and other parts of NIST had been preparing for the Trump administration to set new priorities for their work. In anticipation, some NIST teams began moving to deprioritize efforts such as fighting misinformation and racial bias in AI systems, according to two people familiar with the projects. Two other people say that putting even more public emphasis on national security was welcomed among some staffers, since the institute has already engaged in related research efforts.\nOverall, the AI Safety Institute has been pressing ahead with working groups and other efforts focused on developing guidelines for studying AI systems. Last week, the startup Scale AI announced it had been selected by the institute as its ‚Äúfirst approved third-party evaluator authorized to conduct AI model assessments.‚Äù Michael Kratsios, Trump‚Äôs pick to direct the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, was until recently Scale‚Äôs managing director.\nThe feared layoffs at NIST have drawn strong rebuke from civil society groups, such as the Center for AI Policy, and congressional Democrats. NIST‚Äôs 2024 budget was about $1.5 billion, approximately .02 percent of federal spending overall, making it perhaps an unlikely target for Musk‚Äôs DOGE project. DOGE staffers have dropped into several government agencies this month, gaining access to sensitive systems, promoting the use of AI to boost productivity, and seeding a trail of resignations among longtime government workers. DOGE‚Äôs specific goals at NIST couldn‚Äôt be immediately learned.\nUS representative Jake Auchincloss, a Democrat who serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, says any efforts by DOGE to trim NIST rather than focusing instead on parts of government that account for far more spending, such as Department of Defense contracts, amounts to ‚Äúscrounging for pennies in front of a bank vault.‚Äù He called NIST an agency with high returns on investment and warned that hobbling it would be self-defeating for the US. ‚ÄúImparing NIST‚Äôs function is going to harm business productivity and increase costs,‚Äù Auchincloss says.\nStaff for Democrats on the US House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology say they are concerned about the potential for significant economic harm from any cuts to NIST. The agency‚Äôs timekeeping is used by stock markets, and its research on buildings and pipelines help keep infrastructure intact. DOGE ‚Äúmight throw out things that are crucial to the functioning of the economy,‚Äù says one of the Democratic staffers, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nBudget cuts at other agencies could also have ripple effects at NIST, because they help fund some of its projects, including studies on the accuracy of face recognition systems and a database of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre worried about staffing, funding at every research agency in the federal government,‚Äù says the science committee staffer.\nEarlier this month, California representative Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the Republican-controlled House Science Committee, and her colleagues sent letters to the heads of several agencies, including NIST and NASA, demanding transparency about DOGE activities.\n‚ÄúWhile NIST does not conduct classified research, its cutting edge work in topics such as AI, quantum sensors and clocks, and semiconductors are world-class, and improper exfiltration to non-secure servers would be a boon for our adversaries,‚Äù stated the letter last week to NIST acting director Craig Burkhardt. It demanded a response from him by February 18; as of February 19, there had been none, according to Lofgren‚Äôs office.\nThe letter also raised concern about Musk‚Äôs potential conflicts of interest at NIST, given the intimate dealings between the AI Safety Institute and his competitors. Representative Auchincloss, who has studied NIST‚Äôs biology projects, expressed concern about Musk potentially gaining an unfair advantage and compromising safety by influencing standards that affect his Neuralink brain implant venture.\nNIST was originally created in 1901 to help the US science and engineering industries establish scientific norms in areas like measurement.

The fears were heightened last week when some NIST workers witnessed a handful of people they believed to be associated with DOGE inside Building 225, which houses the NIST Information Technology Laboratory at the agency‚Äôs Gaithersburg, Maryland, campus, according to multiple people briefed on the sightings. The DOGE staff were seeking access to NIST‚Äôs IT systems, one of the people said.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Soon after the purported visit, NIST leadership told employees that DOGE staffers were not currently on campus, but that office space and technology were being provisioned for them, according to the same people.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/tech-policy/2025/02/19/nist-prepares-to-cut-ai-safety-institute-chips-staff\">Axios</a> and <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/commerce-agency-to-order-mass-firing-of-chips-ai-staffers\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/commerce-agency-to-order-mass-firing-of-chips-ai-staffers\" href=\"https://news.bgov.com/bloomberg-government-news/commerce-agency-to-order-mass-firing-of-chips-ai-staffers\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a> reported that NIST had begun informing some employees that they could soon be laid off. About 500 recent hires who are still in probationary status and can be let go more easily were among those expected to be affected, according to the reports. Three sources tell WIRED that the cuts likely impact lauded technical experts in leadership positions, including three lab directors who were promoted within the last year. One person familiar with the agency tells WIRED that the official layoff notices may come Friday.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">The White House and a spokesperson for NIST, which is part of the Department of Commerce, did not yet return requests for comment.</p><p class=\"paywall\">One NIST team that has been fearing cuts because of its number of probationary employees is the US AI Safety Institute (AISI), which was created after former President Joe Biden‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/joe-bidens-executive-order-ai-us-government-chatgpt/\">sweeping executive order on AI</a> issued in October 2023. Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/\">rescinded</a> the order shortly after taking office last month, describing it as a ‚Äúbarrier to American leadership in artificial intelligence.‚Äù</p><p class=\"paywall\">The AI Safety Institute and its roughly two dozen staffers have been working closely with AI companies, including rivals to Musk‚Äôs startup xAI like OpenAI and Anthropic, to understand and test the capabilities of their most powerful models. Musk was an early investor in OpenAI and is currently suing the startup over its decision to transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation.</p><p class=\"paywall\">AISI‚Äôs inaugural director, Elizabeth Kelly, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ai-safety-institute-director-leaves-role-2025-02-06/\">announced</a> she was leaving her role earlier this month. Several other high-profile NIST leaders working on AI have also departed in recent weeks, including Reva Schwartz, who led NIST‚Äôs Assessing Risks and Impacts of AI program, and Elham Tabassi, NIST‚Äôs chief AI adviser. Kelly and Schwartz declined to comment. Tabassi did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p class=\"paywall\">US vice president JD Vance recently signaled the new administration‚Äôs intent to deprioritize AI safety at the AI Action Summit, a major international meeting held in Paris last week that AISI and other government staffers were <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/trumps-paris-ai-summit-delegation-not-include-ai-safety-institute-staff-sources-2025-02-06/\">not invited</a> to attend, according to three familiar with the matter. ‚ÄúI'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety,‚Äù Vance said in his first major speech as VP. ‚ÄúI'm here to talk about AI opportunity.‚Äù</p></div></div></body></html>",

This money was intended to support the $8.45 billion in farmer subsidies authorized in the IRA to be spent on the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)‚Äîa plan to encourage farmers to take up practices with potential environmental benefits, such as cover cropping and better waste storage. At least one contracted farming project funded by EQIP has been paused by the Trump administration, Reuters reports.\nThe $300 million was supposed to be used to establish an agricultural greenhouse gas network that could monitor the effectiveness of the kinds of conservation practices funded by EQIP and other multibillion-dollar conservation programs, says Emily Bass, associate director of federal policy, food, and agriculture at the environmental research center the Breakthrough Institute. This work was being carried out in part by the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), two of the scientific sub-agencies hit heavily by the federal layoffs.\nGot a Tip?\nAre you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what‚Äôs happening? We‚Äôd like to hear from you.

Many of their unit‚Äôs projects are now in disarray, the scientist says, including work that has been planned out in five-year cycles and requires close monitoring of plant specimens. ‚ÄúIn the short term we can keep that material alive, but we can‚Äôt necessarily do that indefinitely if we don‚Äôt have anybody on that project.‚Äù\nIn a press release, the USDA has said its plan is to ‚Äúoptimize its workforce,‚Äù with this including ‚Äúrelocating employees out of the National Capital region into our nation‚Äôs heartland to allow our rural communities to flourish.‚Äù But ARS units are located across the US, each one specializing in crops that are important to local farmers as well as bringing jobs to the region. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always been very popular in rural areas because the farmers and growers actually want what we‚Äôre doing,‚Äù says the ARS scientist. The USDA did not respond to WIRED‚Äôs request for comment.\nThe hollowing-out of staff capacity will limit the USDA‚Äôs ability to implement IRA policies, says Bass, but it is not clear that this was the sole intention of the cuts. ‚ÄúThis seems to be a sledgehammer to the workforce in a way that will just roll back the number of folks on payroll,‚Äù she says.\nThe purge could also indirectly hit farmers in red states, who are the main beneficiaries of proposals such as EQIP. ‚ÄúIt was necessary research to preserve our agricultural lands and fight climate change,‚Äù says one ARS employee who was fired last week after serving more than two years of their three-year-long probation. ‚ÄúCompared to the rest of the government, ARS is tiny,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúBut we were able to get a lot done with relatively little money.‚Äù\nOn her first full day in office, US secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins told USDA staffers gathered at its headquarters in Washington that she supported the Department of Government Efficiency‚Äôs attempt to optimize the USDA workforce. ‚ÄúI welcome DOGE‚Äôs efforts at USDA, because we know that its work makes us better, stronger, faster, and more efficient,‚Äù she told the gathering.\nBut Bass warns that blanket firing of USDA employees is hardly a pathway toward a more efficient agency. ‚ÄúThis approach of wide-swath firings throws the USDA and affiliated agricultural research enterprise into a world of uncertainty,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúProjects that cannot be seen out to the end, cannot result in a peer-reviewed research paper or technical expertise being provided, are a waste of taxpayer dollars.‚Äù",

What are we working on this week?\nZo√´ Schiffer: I feel great you guys. I had a meeting with Steven Levy just now, and I was really having a moment where I was like, wow, it's so cool that I am regularly meeting with one of my literary heroes who I would read when I was desperately wanting to become a tech journalist and now we work together. So cool.\nLauren Goode: I bet if you told Steven that he would really appreciate it.\nZo√´ Schiffer: I didn't. I wanted to play it a little bit cool. This was only our second one-on-one, but maybe he can tell. Lauren, how are you doing this week?\nLauren Goode: I am doing OK. I'm a little under the weather, but I'm hanging in. It could be a lot worse. And I actually had a delightful time appearing at a BBC show recently in which they were asking all about the Brologarchy. We absolutely cannot take credit for coining the phrase, the Brologarchy. It's widespread at this point, but just so you guys know, it has spread across the pond.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Great. I actually feel like because we're a podcast, we could take credit for that. We can say we coined whatever term.\nLauren Goode: It's true. Who's fact-checking? Mike, how are you doing?\nMichael Calore: Well, we've been very, very busy here at WIRED, and all of the teams have been cranking, and it's the end of the week. We're recording this on a Friday, and my brain is like a pineapple floating down a river and I'm ready to fish that pineapple out of the river and sell it for 9.47 Dogecoin.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Wow, that analogy. Incredible.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Is that a well-known metaphor or something?\nZo√´ Schiffer: You're not a pineapple floating down a river, Lauren?\nLauren Goode: No. That sounds like something out of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez book, which I'm into.\nZo√´ Schiffer: I feel like it's because Mike partied all last weekend and then went into the week really strong and had a really busy week. So it's the combo platter of burning the candle from both ends, if you will.\nLauren Goode: Well, Mike, if you can't do the show today, we got you. We're all friends here.\nZo√´ Schiffer: That is very on theme because in some ways we're talking about friendship this week, except it's a friendship that has gone very, very sour. And thus-\nMichael Calore: As sour as a pineapple.\nZo√´ Schiffer: As sour as a sour pineapple. Oh, yeah.\nMichael Calore: That's right. This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power and influence of Silicon Valley. Today, it's a showdown. Sam Altman and Elon Musk. We're talking about the relationship between the two of them and the company that started at all, OpenAI. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nZo√´ Schiffer: And I'm Zoe Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nMichael Calore: OK, it's story time. Let's go back to the early days of OpenAI because the two men that we were talking about today, Elon Musk and Sam Altman, have a long history, some of which began around the founding of OpenAI.\nZo√´ Schiffer: OK. Taking us back to 2015 when OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab with the goal of getting to artificial general intelligence, AI that can meet or exceed human intelligence. So yeah, Elon and Sam start the company together, but within three years, Elon Musk basically thinks that OpenAI has fallen way too far behind Google and isn't going to be able to catch up. And so he has a solution to this problem, and most Elon Musk solutions, it casts him in the role of Savior. So he goes to Sam and he says, \"Hey, what if I actually take over OpenAI and I run it?\" And Sam and Greg Brockman, another OpenAI cofounder, say, \"No, we don't like that solution.\" And so Elon Musk ends up walking away. He had said he was going to donate money over the next few years, but he ended up not doing that. And so by 2019, we see Sam Altman in the role of president of OpenAI and Elon Musk stepping away from the board of directors.\nLauren Goode: And they weren't just disagreeing about the funding. They reportedly were disagreeing about OpenAI's status as a nonprofit since it was started as a nonprofit.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah. So this is a really important part of the saga because again, it starts out as a nonprofit, but really quickly as you're alluding to, Sam Altman and Elon Musk both realize the computing power that is needed to power artificial intelligence and make these enormous leaps in the progress of these large language models is so high that you basically have to have a for-profit arm of the company. And so they do create a for-profit entity. This is the beginning of OpenAI's super bizarre structure where it's a nonprofit with a for-profit subsidiary. This happens in 2019, and this gets us into the growing tension between Elon Musk and Sam Altman. But before we go too far down that road, I'll just say to answer your question, Lauren. Yeah, they both, according to emails that have since come out between the two of them, Elon Musk does seem to acknowledge that OpenAI is going to need a for-profit entity. And in fact, he suggests at one point that maybe Tesla just acquire OpenAI or OpenAI merge with Tesla, and that could be a possible solution. And again, Sam Altman's like, \"No, I do not like that solution.\" And so, growing animosity, growing tension behind the scenes.\nLauren Goode: And there are power dynamics at play here, too. I think at this point, in the mid-2010s, Elon Musk was a little more well-known because of PayPal, SpaceX, founding or buying his way into founding Tesla. And Sam at this point is the YC Combinator guy who then got into AI.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah. Although it also is worth pointing out that the field of artificial intelligence did not have the standing and reputation that it currently does. When they started OpenAI, the idea that you would start an entire nonprofit or company to go after AGI was pretty fringe, I think it's worth saying. We didn't have a bunch of AI hardware products on the scene in 2018, did we?\nMichael Calore: No, because there wasn't really the back end. The chatbot revolution had not yet come.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Right. OK. So what they're doing, it's like Lauren, to your point, there are a bunch of power dynamics. There's a bunch of hierarchy, but I feel like it's not until OpenAI launches on the scene with ChatGPT that this becomes an incredibly important question and people's egos get much more involved because suddenly AI is the story in Silicon Valley. It's the future of technology. It's seen as this enormous shift rather than like, oh, our interesting nonprofit research lab idea.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, this feels like one of the bigger shifts that we've witnessed, I think, as tech journalists. The AI world was aware of these developments because of the research papers that Google and OpenAI and others put out around 2017, 2018, but it was really that November 2022 moment, I think, when ChatGPT launched that everybody wanted to get into AI.\nMichael Calore: So right around that time, Lauren, when ChatGPT was shown off to the world, OpenAI had established a business partner in Microsoft. Microsoft put some money into the company. Zoe, what role did Microsoft play in making OpenAI a household name?\nZo√´ Schiffer: A huge role. I mean, so we mentioned that in March 2019, OpenAI, the nonprofit launches a for-profit subsidiary, which allows it to raise money. Months later, Microsoft, to your point and question, puts in a billion dollars. So at this point, OpenAI is basically off to the races, and within a couple of years, it launches ChatGPT. So it's a big moment for OpenAI. It's a big moment for Microsoft. It also is a big moment for the tension that's going on between Sam Altman and Elon Musk, and within OpenAI itself. The board of directors at OpenAI, the nonprofit board, has said, according to some reporting that came out after that, they didn't actually know, or some members didn't know that ChatGPT was launching until they saw Sam Altman's tweet about it. And not all of them were super happy with this new direction because if you can imagine, you start a nonprofit research lab, suddenly it's becoming like a consumer-facing app powerhouse, that's a different direction for the company, and not everyone was happy about that.\nMichael Calore: So that tension leads to an event that, again, we talked about on our Sam Altman episode, but it's something known as the blip.\nLauren Goode: The blip, OK. The blip refers to that three to four-day period in late November 2023 when Sam Altman was ousted by the board as CEO of OpenAI, and this became, in a way, representative of at least two schools of thought around AI. There are people who think we need safety guardrails for it, and there are people who just want to accelerate it as quickly as possible. The whole thing backfired, I guess, is the best way to put it, because Microsoft swept in, they offered to scoop up Sam, they offered to hire a bunch of OpenAI employees, and at the same time, a lot of OpenAI employees signed a letter in support of Sam. So Sam ended up being reinstated, and the rest is history. The people who tried to oust him immediately left the board. Sam stacked the board with a bunch of friendlies, and Sam remains CEO of OpenAI.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yes, incredibly dramatic few days where Sam leaves and comes back, the board of directors changes, every newsroom, your boss is coming to you saying, \"Who do you know on the board of directors at OpenAI?\" And you're in a panic. I mean, that's stressful. But yeah, I mean the thing that comes out of all of this is that Sam Altman is back on top, back in the leadership role at OpenAI, and he has arguably a lot more power because like Lauren said, the board is stacked with people who are more loyal to him than what it was previously.\nLauren Goode: And Zoe, did Elon Musk pipe up during any of this? What was his take on this?\nZo√´ Schiffer: So yeah, I mean, right around the time that OpenAI launches ChatGPT, the feud between Elon Musk and Sam Altman that had been brewing in the background starts to become more public. A month after ChatGPT launches, Twitter, which Elon Musk famously owns, cuts access. OpenAI had access to the firehose of data from Twitter so it could feed into its large language models. Elon Musk cuts that access. Then he starts tweeting about how it was created as an open source nonprofit, and now it's doing something else. And this is a big problem, and he starts to hint publicly that he doesn't think this transformation of OpenAI from nonprofit to having a for-profit arm is above board. He hints that it might be, in his view, illegal.\nMichael Calore: All right. So that pretty much brings us up to speed on the tension between these two gentlemen and the company that they're arguing over. So let's take a break and we'll come right back and talk about the latest events. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. So today, OpenAI is still a non-profit with a for-profit subsidiary and is in the process of converting the for-profit arm of the company into a public benefit corporation. What does that mean and why are they doing it?\nZo√´ Schiffer: I feel like the company has been, not mysterious, but the way they've talked about this switch from non-profit to for-benefit corporation is like, this is what's needed to move OpenAI into its next era. I think it's also true that the company just had a very confusing structure before, and it doesn't really make sense because it's changed so much as a company. It just isn't a non-profit research lab anymore. It has such a big part of it has millions and millions of ChatGPT users and a bunch of different product lines. And so I think in a lot of ways this new structure might make more sense. I also think there's a huge competition for talent within the AI community, and so it makes sense that employees would want to benefit from getting more typical stock grants like they would at a normal tech company. So I think there are a bunch of different reasons for it.\nLauren Goode: The question I have also is where does xAI play into this too? Now that Elon and Sam are direct competitors,\nZo√´ Schiffer: Right. Yeah. Well, I mean, OK, not to take us on too big a tangent, but obviously Elon Musk started xAI, an artificial intelligence company that directly competes with OpenAI and ChatGPT. xAI launches a chatbot called GROK that it's like the unwoke chatbot is how it's branded. It's like ChatGPT, but it'll make bad jokes and swear at you and maybe can teach you how to cook cocaine in your kitchen or whatever. I'm not sure.\nLauren Goode: Now we know what Zoe's been using it for.\nZo√´ Schiffer: No, I feel like on the podcast whenever Lex Friedman and Elon are talking about it, they're like, \"Ha ha ha. Let's, on air, ask it how to make a drug or something.\" I don't know. They'll do some little bit and I'm like, I feel like we've been over this. It'll tell you how to cook meth. I get it. Anyway, xAI has enormous resources, or I had this perception that it's way behind OpenAI, but in fact, Elon has connected a hundred thousand GPUs in a cluster. Previously they thought the most you could connect was 30,000, and so if scaling laws hold, xAI could really be in the lead. But it's clear that Elon Musk is still pretty seemingly, in my opinion, bitter about OpenAI's success. And so earlier in February, he launches this unsolicited bid with a group of other investors, including people like Antonio Gracias, who is a private equity guy, and one of Elon's closest advisors, helped advise him on the Twitter bid, is very involved with DOGE as well, and they come forward with an unsolicited offer to take over OpenAI for more than $97 billion.\nLauren Goode: How did he arrive at that number?\nZo√´ Schiffer: Do we ever know? I was just impressed that it wasn't-\nLauren Goode: 420.\nZo√´ Schiffer: 420.\nLauren Goode: $690 billion.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, exactly. I was like, wow, we just got an actual number? I'm shocked.\nMichael Calore: Well, the company is actually valued more than that. Correct?\nZo√´ Schiffer: I think their last valuation was like 157 billion and they're in talks with SoftBank right now that SoftBank would lead another funding round of 40 billion, which would bring the valuation up to 300 billion, some sources have said. So yeah, we're not a hundred percent sure how they got to the 97 billion number, but suffice to say that Sam Altman comes back immediately on X, he's posting, \"No, thank you, but I‚Äôll buy X for $9 billion if you want.\" And then Elon Musk responds to that. What does he say? \"Swindler,\" or something? I don't know. They're just like‚Äî\nMichael Calore: Swindler, yes.\nZo√´ Schiffer: ‚Ä¶ fighting in public. It's super messy. But Sam also behind the scenes at OpenAI is telling employees really clearly, ‚ÄúI am not interested in this, and the board isn't interested in this either.‚Äù\nMichael Calore: So why would Elon throw out a number that he knows is less than the company is actually worth?\nZo√´ Schiffer: So this is the interesting thing because you would think it's still a nonprofit. It's in the process of switching, but because the board isn't like a typical for-profit board, it doesn't have a fiduciary duty to maximize profit for shareholders. So maybe they can just reject this offer. But in fact, a nonprofit board, as I understand it, does have a fiduciary duty to get the fair market value for the company's assets so that the nonprofit can achieve its mission, which is a little bit convoluted, but what it means is that maybe Elon Musk's goal in this was not literally to take over OpenAI. Maybe his goal was to set a floor on the value of OpenAI's assets so that Sam Altman has to pay more than $97 billion, and he can't come in and say, \"Oh, I think the assets are just worth 50 billion,\" and get a sweetheart deal, because now there's a public number attached to it that's much higher than that.\nLauren Goode: I don't know, Zoe, I mean, Elon was quoted as saying, \"It's time for OpenAI to return to the open source safety-focused force for good it once was.\" And Elon the savior here. Clearly in this case, we should take this at face value.\nZo√´ Schiffer: I think everything Elon says he falls to us. So I take it.\nMichael Calore: I just think it's really brash because it's an unsolicited bid. The company was not out there looking to sell itself, and it's essentially somebody walks up to your $1 million house, there's no For Sale sign out front, knocks on the door and says, \"I'll give you 300 grand for it.\"\nZo√´ Schiffer: Right, right. Yeah, exactly. I mean, when Sam was talking about this internally in messages that I saw, he was putting the word bid in scare quotes, which I thought was pretty funny and saying, \"Yeah, basically Elon says a whole lot of things.\" The insinuation was we're not taking him very seriously. He said, \"This is frankly embarrassing to watch.\"\nLauren Goode: Sam said that?\nZo√´ Schiffer: To his employees.\nLauren Goode: Interesting.\nMichael Calore: He also came out on X and said something about, \"I wish he would compete.\"\nZo√´ Schiffer: Oh, yeah. He was like, \"I wish he would compete in the marketplace, not in the courtroom.\"\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Sam said in a Bloomberg News interview, \"I wish he would just compete by building a better product. Probably his whole life is from a position of insecurity.\" Shots fired. And he said he didn't think that he was a happy person.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Oh my gosh. Is Sam Altman trying to compete to write the next Elon Musk biography? This feels like some Walter Isaacson level psychology.\nLauren Goode: I don't know. Zoe, I have to say, every time I see something like this breaking in the news, these two guys fighting something with OpenAI, I quite literally hear your voice in my head from one of our earlier episodes going, \"Messy, messy, messy.\"\nZo√´ Schiffer: It is. It is so messy. I really had that this week when they were this whole swindler back and forth thing. I was like, you guys. I mean, I appreciate it. I like that we can see all of it, but at the same time, no comms team. Wow. Yeah, you can tell.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Now, we should probably just put out there too, that there are critics of OpenAI that think it's completely over-hyped and overvalued who would look at that $157 billion valuation, even though it is based on private funding, that then just equates to a certain valuation and just say, there's no way they're worth that much. There's no way that they can generate enough revenue in the next three to five years to justify that valuation.\nZo√´ Schiffer: I mean, have those people looked at Silicon Valley startups before? Do they know how this whole industry runs?\nLauren Goode: Right, exactly.\nMichael Calore: Well, a big part of that conversation over the last month or so has been DeepSeek, right? The Chinese-owned chatbot competitor to ChatGPT.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah. Another moment where our bosses said, \"What do we know about DeepSeek?\" And we panic saying, \"No idea. What is it? Never heard of it.\" But yeah, I mean, this is a chatbot that launched on the scene. It's basically made a model that competes very directly with OpenAI's best reasoning models, but the company says that it trained it with a fraction of the specialized GPUs that OpenAI used, and at a fraction of the cost. Again, I feel like, Lauren, we need to put in the caveat. A lot of people dispute this. They don't believe it, but that's the idea. And the market reacts pretty intensely. Nvidia, which Lauren you have reported on extensively, their stock takes a bit of a hit.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, a bit of a hit. I forget how many billions they lost in value that day. It was like, whoops. Yeah. All of a sudden, Jensen Huang was going to Supercuts for his haircuts. Hold on a second. Stock drop after DeepSeek. Yeah. Supposedly it stock fell by around 17 percent on the news of DeepSeek, which I haven't calculated how many billions that was, but it was a lot, $600 billion off of its value. People were very nervous about this, whether or not they could trust the information that was coming from China is a different question. But if it was true, then yeah, it rattled the AI market. And as a result, I think it was a week later, that's when OpenAI decided to launch its o3-mini reasoning model, which means very little to people who aren't following this very closely, but it was a way for them to say, look, we're advancing the boundaries of what these smaller models can achieve, and smaller typically means less expensive. It apparently responded 24 percent faster than another mini model that OpenAI had put out. Its answers included 39 percent fewer mistakes. It was supposed to do more reasoning. And so I think we're going to be seeing a lot of this. I also think we're going to be seeing some of the big players in AI look to make strategic acquisitions of smaller AI companies as a rapid way of getting their tech up to speed to match whatever DeepSeek is doing.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah. Sam Altman went real founder mode in that moment. I mean, the company did say, \"We'd been planning o3-mini for a long time,\" but the framing of it definitely becomes like, \"Oh, yeah, DeepSeek? Well, look at us.\" Because the idea is, and the reason that Nvidia stock took such a hit is the whole way that the industry is heading is based on the idea that we need tons and tons of computing power. So if in fact there's this big innovation and you can make these models more and more intelligent with a fraction of the chips and not a fraction of the cost, then it's like, whoa, are we going to need as many chips in the future? Have we dramatically overestimated the AI infrastructure investments that we need to make? So a bit of an open question, although a lot of people would say, no more chips is more better.\nLauren Goode: Zoe, what are the rank and file inside of OpenAI saying about this skirmish, this messy, messy, messy between these guys?\nZo√´ Schiffer: Well, I think actually both moments, the DeepSeek moment and the Elon moment have galvanized people. I think OpenAI employees have a lot of pride in what they're doing. They have a lot of pride and loyalty towards Sam Altman. And so when these players come up and they're trying to unseat OpenAI as the leader in the space, you see employees really rally around and be like, OK, no, we're going to do more. We're going to go faster. We're going to work harder. Which I mean, these people work really long hours. They work all the time.\nLauren Goode: How long are we talking here?\nZo√´ Schiffer: They work much more than us in the post inauguration period, which, if-\nLauren Goode: Wow.\nZo√´ Schiffer: ‚Ä¶ anyone knows how this newsroom was doing during that time, a lot.\nLauren Goode: Zoe just assume you have a live stream into their office that they don't know about. You tap on the live stream and you check in.\nZo√´ Schiffer: There are people who've just done incredible reporting on this. But yeah, I think in the employee gossip reaction zone, I'm like, I've got a good handle on things.\nLauren Goode: And Zoe, where does Bret Taylor stand in all of this?\nZo√´ Schiffer: Oh, my gosh. I can't even believe I was about to skip over this. OK, so when we're talking about the OpenAI's board's reaction to Elon Musk's unsolicited bid, we have to talk about Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of Salesforce, who was also chairman of the board at Twitter when Elon Musk tried to and then successfully acquired the company. So this is someone who had to put up with a lot of back and forth with Elon, a lot of public and private fights, and suddenly he's installed as the board chair at OpenAI. And what happens, Elon Musk makes an unsolicited bid to buy that company too. So I imagine Bret Taylor is having quite a time right now, but arguably is also better equipped than most to handle this situation.\nLauren Goode: That's right. Bret Taylor is also running his own AI startup now.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, they're doing like agentic chatbot,\nLauren Goode: Agentic customer service chatbot. But yeah, so he's deep in the AI world. Fun fact. I first interviewed Bret Taylor years ago when he was working on a little word processing app called Quip. Do you guys remember Quip?\nZo√´ Schiffer: No, but I'm incredibly jealous because I've reached out to him for a comment 5 billion times. Never a word.\nLauren Goode: I think he's a lot busier now, maybe.\nZo√´ Schiffer: You're saying he doesn't have time for me?\nLauren Goode: No, this is years ago that I spoke to Bret. Yeah, Bret, we're open to reengaging.\nMichael Calore: OK, let's take another break and we'll come right back. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. So Elon Musk has made this bid to purchase OpenAI for $97.4 billion, even though the company has a valuation that is much higher than that and is close to closing another round with SoftBank, that will change its valuation yet again. So does Elon's bid change anything about OpenAI's position in the market and its transition into this public benefit corporation?\nZo√´ Schiffer: I think we can just say that it makes it more complicated. Now, like we said before, there's a floor on the price of OpenAI's assets. Sam Altman as an insider in the space is going to have to come up with more money than that, or it could look a little bit weird. And I think we have yet to see, there's a lot of speculation and the experts that I talked to when reporting on this story that Elon Musk's goal is to just set a floor on the price of those assets to force Sam to pay more, but there's also the possibility that he's completely serious about this and is really going to try and force the issue. So I think it's still a little bit TBD.\nMichael Calore: Isn't he busy? Doesn't he have some things going on in his life right now?\nZo√´ Schiffer: No idea what you're talking about.\nMichael Calore: It definitely feels like the proverbial shot across the bow. Like Elon Musk and Sam Altman have been trading barbs. I think Elon is probably the spicier of the two of them with regards to the veracity of his barbs and the seriousness of his actions. To me, this does not feel like a genuine bid. It's obvious from his past actions that he still wants to take control over the company, and this just feels like the latest move that he's deploying to try and get control.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. This isn't related to AI specifically, but did you guys hear how Tesla sales are cratering in Europe?\nZo√´ Schiffer: I did hear that.\nLauren Goode: Last month Norway recorded a 37.9 percent slump in Tesla sales. France sales fell by 63.4 percent. Spain, it gets worse, or better, Tesla sales plummeted by 75.4 percent.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Wait, and why do they think this is it?\nLauren Goode: It's really hard to say. Companies are calling their fleet models. Some fan forum owners are selling their cars. Some people who were really big Tesla fans are selling their cars. It is hard to attribute it entirely to this, but people are saying that Musk's increasingly alt-right stance, his various antics are starting to seriously impact his EV business there.\nZo√´ Schiffer: It's so interesting because it's the very thing that allowed Elon to stay on top, even when Tesla wasn't doing as well from a business perspective. It was like his reputation was so tied to the company that the stock price would stay pretty high even when the company was going through bad periods. Now it's like the fact that his reputation is tied so close to the company is really coming back to bite him a little bit, it looks like.\nLauren Goode: Yep. One of the sources quoted in the WIRED article said that, \"While Musk might get away with a Nazi-like salute in some parts of the world, European markets reject such behavior.\" Good for Europe.\nMichael Calore: That really says a lot about us in the United States, doesn't it?\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Although I was driving down Sand Hill Road the other day and was driving behind a Tesla that had a circle sticker on the back of it with Elon with a red line slashed through his name.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Interesting.\nMichael Calore: Yes, those are very popular. There are a lot of people who are using the rear bumper of their Teslas to virtue signal that they do not support Elon Musk's politics.\nLauren Goode: Yes. And up north of the city here in Marin, I saw a large sign on a store window that said, \"Tesla is MAGA.\"\nMichael Calore: And I think it's fine that we veered into politics because we can't talk about Elon Musk without talking about the politics in the United States. And I have to wonder if Elon Musk's position in the federal government right now has anything to do with why he's interested in taking control of OpenAI.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah. I'm really curious to see how this plays out. Trump has appointed David Sacks, who's a close Elon Musk ally, worked at PayPal with him back in the day, as the US AI and crypto tsar, so presumably someone that will be in charge of shaping AI regulations in the United States. And I think there's concern from people who run competitive AI companies that perhaps these people will pass regulations that advantage xAI and disadvantage other companies. But this is all speculation right now.\nMichael Calore: Well, wherever it goes, it's probably going to play out in public. Elon Musk loves to go on X and shout at people and call names and retweet things that he agrees with or things that he disagrees with and comment on them. So we're probably going to see more spicy tweets get fired between these two guys, and I am looking forward to that.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Well, the other thing that I was going to say is that Elon's position in the government puts Sam Altman in a very interesting position, and I think because Sam Altman was pretty publicly anti-Trump. And then of course, Trump is reelected. The whole industry, at least the tech elite become more MAGA friendly, if you will. Sam Altman is now really trying to play nice. And one way that he does this is shortly after the inauguration, OpenAI announces Stargate, which is this planned $500 billion AI infrastructure project with a bunch of partners, including Nvidia and Microsoft and other players. And he allows Trump to take the credit for that project to get to announce it and talk about how important it's going to be for jobs in the United States and the war to beat China and all of this stuff. Even though the project was underway during the Biden administration, they strategically plan it so that Trump can get credit. And to me it was like, oh, Sam Altman is trying to bypass Elon Musk and get right to Trump to make sure he's not left out of the equation as stuff moves forward from a regulatory politics, all this stuff, perspective.\nMichael Calore: It's just a big game of chess.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: Well, Silicon Valley has had a lot of feuds between large ego-ed people, usually men, over the years, and I'm just wondering if there's anything that we can compare this to. Is there anything that rises to the same level of wildness as this particular feud between Sam and Elon?\nZo√´ Schiffer: Large ego-ed people is the euphemism we use instead of saying men from now on.\nMichael Calore: Having a large ego is not necessarily a bad thing. It just depends on how you apply it, right?\nLauren Goode: I mean, I think Gates and Jobs are probably the most famous ones, right? Because from pretty much the early days, Microsoft was making software for Apple computers, but then I think it was around the '80s when Microsoft launched Windows and Jobs said that Microsoft was ripping off the Macintosh, right?\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: And that continued for a while. And what was the big fight over Flash, Mike?\nMichael Calore: The big fight over Flash was that Steve Jobs hated it. He thought it was buggy. He thought it was a security risk, and he wanted the world to just use HTML embedded video instead of Flash and use the new spec for building web pages for interactions, because everybody had these Flash interfaces in the browser. And he went on this public campaign. He started blogging about how Flash was bad and how it should go away. And I think his big adversary at the time was Kevin Lynch, who was the executive at Adobe that ran the Flash software department, and they got into this public spat, and they were speaking on stage and they were both blogging and they were both being interviewed in the press talking about how the other company was wrong. And eventually Apple won. It said video and interactions on the open web is better than video and interactions through this janky plugin and Flash died and is no longer a part of the web. And now Kevin Lynch works at Apple and he runs the Apple Watch program.\nLauren Goode: I was going to say, is that the same Kevin Lynch at Apple? That's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and then Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg have been feuding lately too, although they're not bloggy about it. Can you imagine Tim Cook writing a blog? I just-\nZo√´ Schiffer: No. I feel like Elon and Mark Zuckerberg also have their feud and the whole cage match thing.\nLauren Goode: That's right. The cage match. Yes. And then this is also same category, but not as contentious. Evan Spiegel from Snapchat and Mark Zuckerberg, they don't seem to be on super great terms. And then recently Evan Spiegel changed his LinkedIn bio to say that he was the VP of product for Facebook, which was making fun of how Facebook-slash-Meta steals all of Snapchat's product ideas. The fact that Evan Spiegel actually took to LinkedIn to do that really says something. LinkedIn. Do you think that he got, what is it called when someone gives you accolades on-\nZo√´ Schiffer: Endorse.\nLauren Goode: ‚Ä¶ LinkedIn? Endorse. Do you think he got endorsements for that? I endorse Evan Spiegel for his sense of humor.\nMichael Calore: That feels like as good of a place as any to end. I look forward to coming back and recording a follow-up episode when this saga continues in, I don't know, three weeks.\nZo√´ Schiffer: I'm really excited for when this podcast is a booming success. And then later they're like, \"They all used to run a podcast together, and then there was this falling out.\" And it was like we go to war, and then, they were having competing podcasts and, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, I'm going to try to convert Uncanny Valley into a nonprofit public benefit corporation.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. And going to come in and I'm going to try to buy your podcast for a fraction of what it's worth.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, $9 specifically.\nMichael Calore: I'll sell you a pineapple.

He was like, \"I wish he would compete in the marketplace, not in the courtroom.\"</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> Yeah. Sam said in a Bloomberg News interview, \"I wish he would just compete by building a better product. Probably his whole life is from a position of insecurity.\" Shots fired. And he said he didn't think that he was a happy person.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zo√´ Schiffer:</strong> Oh my gosh. Is Sam Altman trying to compete to write the next Elon Musk biography? This feels like some Walter Isaacson level psychology.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> I don't know. Zoe, I have to say, every time I see something like this breaking in the news, these two guys fighting something with OpenAI, I quite literally hear your voice in my head from one of our earlier episodes going, \"Messy, messy, messy.\"</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zo√´ Schiffer:</strong> It is. It is so messy. I really had that this week when they were this whole swindler back and forth thing. I was like, you guys. I mean, I appreciate it. I like that we can see all of it, but at the same time, no comms team. Wow. Yeah, you can tell.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Michael Calore:</strong> Yeah.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> Now, we should probably just put out there too, that there are critics of OpenAI that think it's completely over-hyped and overvalued who would look at that $157 billion valuation, even though it is based on private funding, that then just equates to a certain valuation and just say, there's no way they're worth that much. There's no way that they can generate enough revenue in the next three to five years to justify that valuation.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zo√´ Schiffer:</strong> I mean, have those people looked at Silicon Valley startups before? Do they know how this whole industry runs?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> Right, exactly.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Michael Calore:</strong> Well, a big part of that conversation over the last month or so has been DeepSeek, right? The Chinese-owned chatbot competitor to ChatGPT.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zo√´ Schiffer:</strong> Yeah. Another moment where our bosses said, \"What do we know about DeepSeek?\" And we panic saying, \"No idea. What is it? Never heard of it.\" But yeah, I mean, this is a chatbot that launched on the scene. It's basically made a model that competes very directly with OpenAI's best reasoning models, but the company says that it trained it with a fraction of the specialized GPUs that OpenAI used, and at a fraction of the cost. Again, I feel like, Lauren, we need to put in the caveat. A lot of people dispute this. They don't believe it, but that's the idea. And the market reacts pretty intensely. Nvidia, which Lauren you have reported on extensively, their stock takes a bit of a hit.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> Yeah, a bit of a hit. I forget how many billions they lost in value that day. It was like, whoops. Yeah. All of a sudden, Jensen Huang was going to Supercuts for his haircuts. Hold on a second. Stock drop after DeepSeek. Yeah. Supposedly it stock fell by around 17 percent on the news of DeepSeek, which I haven't calculated how many billions that was, but it was a lot, $600 billion off of its value. People were very nervous about this, whether or not they could trust the information that was coming from China is a different question. But if it was true, then yeah, it rattled the AI market. And as a result, I think it was a week later, that's when OpenAI decided to launch its o3-mini reasoning model, which means very little to people who aren't following this very closely, but it was a way for them to say, look, we're advancing the boundaries of what these smaller models can achieve, and smaller typically means less expensive. It apparently responded 24 percent faster than another mini model that OpenAI had put out. Its answers included 39 percent fewer mistakes. It was supposed to do more reasoning. And so I think we're going to be seeing a lot of this. I also think we're going to be seeing some of the big players in AI look to make strategic acquisitions of smaller AI companies as a rapid way of getting their tech up to speed to match whatever DeepSeek is doing.</p></div></div></body></html>",

I'm WIRED's global editorial director, Katie Drummond. Today on the show: ‚ÄúHow a Law Passed After Watergate Might Stop DOGE in its Tracks.‚Äù I'm recording from the road today, but I am joined by Andrew Couts, WIRED's senior editor for security and investigations. Andrew, welcome to Uncanny Valley.\nAndrew Couts: Thanks for having me.\nKatie Drummond: Now, before we jump into this story that you published on WIRED.com yesterday about the Privacy Act and how it relates to DOGE, tell me and our audience a little bit about what you do here at WIRED. I know what you do, but tell everybody else.\nAndrew Couts: Sure. So a lot of my day-to-day responsibilities include overseeing our security desk, which covers cybersecurity, national security, privacy, surveillance, policing, crime, all the fun, light-hearted topics.\nKatie Drummond: And you have been spending a fair bit of your time recently focused on DOGE and everything DOGE and Elon Musk are doing inside of federal agencies, which has obviously been a big priority for WIRED. Yesterday you published a story, it was written by Eric Geller about the Privacy Act and how it might be used through legal means to thwart what DOGE is doing inside of federal agencies. So why don't you start by telling us a little bit about what the Privacy Act even is. When was it established? Why was it established?\nAndrew Couts: Sure. So the Privacy Act came out of the Nixon era, the Watergate scandals, where Nixon abused his access to government resources to people's data, including the IRS. He sicked FBI on his political opponents. And so lawmakers thought we need to do something to stop this from happening again. And so on December 31st of 1974, the Privacy Act was signed into law and basically it limits the ways in which the government can collect, share, or otherwise use people's personal data.\nKatie Drummond: That's fascinating. So this Privacy Act has a very long history, and why is that important right now? Sort of explain to us how the Privacy Act is being leveraged to try to prevent DOGE from accessing data inside of these agencies.\nAndrew Couts: So the Privacy Act is currently the basis for at least eight, maybe nine lawsuits against DOGE or against agencies where we know that DOGE workers have been accessing those systems. And so essentially the Privacy Act has a lot of limits on who can access data even internally or how that data can be used, but it does have several exceptions. I think 12 exceptions, two of which are pretty broad. One of them includes if an employee \"has the need to access records in the performance of their duties, or a third party can have access if it's for routine use.\" \"Routine use.\" And so as you can imagine when there are loopholes in this moment when it seems every loophole is being exploited in ways that we didn't expect, we're getting to see in these lawsuits how those exceptions are going to be applied. And so in some cases, these lawsuits are already succeeding. We saw one from several states attorney general sued to prevent DOGE employees from accessing treasury records, and a judge very quickly ordered that access to be stopped or limited. In other cases, there were some students at the University of California who sued to prevent DOGE workers from accessing Department of Education records. And in that case, the judge didn't issue a restraining order to prevent that access on some various grounds. And so we're going to see how these other lawsuits play out. A lot of them are really in their early stages and we don't really know yet whether they're going to succeed.\nKatie Drummond: So Andrew, help me understand here, this Privacy Act and these lawsuits, why is this potentially such a big deal for DOGE? How much of their time from what we can tell is being spent basically trying to access data?\nAndrew Couts: So as far as we know, the vast majority of it appears to be at least accessing these systems. And we don't necessarily know for certain what records they've accessed, what they've downloaded, what they've transferred, what they've uploaded to AI. All of these things seem to be possible. And there's reports that both from WIRED and elsewhere that they're using this data in a lot of different ways, but we just don't know what they're accessing. But what they could have access to is basically every possible sensitive detail about a person that exists. And so why are we concerned about that? Because we don't know what they're going to do with that information and how they're securing that information, whether they're making those systems less secure by subverting access controls and things that have typically been in place to protect this information, which everyone agrees it's highly sensitive.\nKatie Drummond: Got it. I mean, it's fair to say that if according to Musk and according to President Trump, DOGE's priorities are rooting out fraud, cutting costs, cutting personnel, they would need access to these systems. They would need data to even begin to start that process, you would think. And if they don't have access to that data, I guess that sort of stops them in their tracks in a given agency.\nAndrew Couts: I mean, one of the first places they went was the Office of Personnel Management, and that's going to be all the records on all federal workers like present, past federal workers. And so that's just information on millions and millions of people. But when we get outside of the federal worker systems, we're talking about everyone who resides in the United States ostensibly.\nKatie Drummond: It's interesting to me that ... What we're almost at is certainly it's true that the Privacy Act and these lawsuits can slow down DOGE access to data in different agencies, but it's wild to imagine that depending on the agency and the judge and the judge's interpretation of this Privacy Act, we might see this very slapdash approach to data access depending on the agency and depending on the lawsuit and depending on the outcome of the lawsuit. Is that right? When we're talking about treasury, that access has been halted for now, Department of Education, not so much. So this might vary agency to agency and lawsuit to lawsuit. Am I accurate in interpreting it that way?\nAndrew Couts: It absolutely seems that way and that seems to be how these lawsuits are already playing out. Part of what I think about is oftentimes a lawsuit will hinge on whether there's actual realized harm or if there's imminent harm. And when we're seeing this government be manipulated in the way that it is by DOGE workers right now, we don't have precedent to rely on to be able to judge is there imminent harm here? Do we know how this data is going to be used? Do we know whether it's going to be weaponized? And if we look at historical precedent, there's maybe not evidence that that harm exists or that imminent harm exists. And so we might have to wait for people to be actually injured by this access for a judge to say, \"That was bad and we're going to stop it.\" And so there's likely going to be victims here, whether these lawsuits succeed or not.\nKatie Drummond: Fascinating. Well, we're going to take a short break. When we come back, we're going to pick up where we left off and talk about how concerned Americans actually should be about their privacy and about DOGE accessing their data. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley, I'm WIRED's global editorial director, Katie Drummond. I'm here with our senior editor for security and investigations, Andrew Couts. Andrew, thank you again for being here.\nAndrew Couts: Thanks for having me.\nKatie Drummond: And let's talk a little bit more broadly about DOGE and American privacy. So there has been, as we at WIRED know very well, a ton of coverage about DOGE and what they're doing inside the federal government over these last several weeks. A lot of swirl, a lot of sort of chaos and a lot of concern, right? There's a lot of concern among journalists and among Americans more broadly about DOGE having access to various government systems, having access to data, access to sensitive information about Americans. Can you explain what kind of information would DOGE potentially have access to based on the agencies that they are currently working in inside the federal government?\nAndrew Couts: So they're going to have access to essentially everything, and they're going to know everywhere you've lived, everywhere you bank, exactly how much money you make, potentially what your tax returns are. They're going to have access to your medical history, likely to what your networks look like, what your social networks look like, everywhere you've worked, potentially travel records.\nKatie Drummond: There was a paragraph in the story that we published yesterday that I thought was really stunning, and it reads in just a few weeks, DOGE staffers have accessed federal employee records at the Office of Personnel Management, government payment data at the Department of Treasury data on student loan recipients at the Department of Education, information on disaster victims at FEMA and vast amounts of employment and workplace-related data at the Department of Labor. And it goes on from there. I mean, this is a sweeping endeavor to access and sort of hoover up a ton of really sensitive information about Americans. Can you walk us through a few different hypothetical scenarios? If DOGE and Musk and President Trump and the White House obtain all of this data, obtain all of this access, what could they do with it?\nAndrew Couts: One of the things we think about internally at WIRED a lot is threat modeling and just basically like what's the chance you're going to be targeted by any type of attack? And in this case, we have to completely redefine what our threat models look like. And that's especially true if you're a vulnerable person. So if you are trans, if you are an immigrant, if you are seeking an abortion, just to throw out the most obvious examples. This information could be used to target you in one way or another, and we just don't know how that information could be used. Historically, you're not going to think that a highly-placed government employee, such as Elon Musk as he is now, would tweet out your banking records or your health records, and we could see that happen now, if you are publicly critical of the Trump administration. Obviously law enforcement, if the FBI is going to be able to use the vast amounts of information that they have on people to target whoever they're going to target, and we just don't know. We're only a month into this administration. We're already seeing sweeping crackdowns on immigration, and that's going to evolve. We're going to go through at least four years of this, and it's impossible really for anyone to know if they are going to be a target. So we just don't know what the threat model looks like in an environment where anyone could potentially become a political target. And if we look at authoritarian regimes, it's going to be used in all different types of ways to go after people. And that data might be manipulated to make up charges against people to accuse people of crimes that they didn't commit. For years, WIRED has covered best privacy practices, best security practices, and a lot of people just say, \"If you have nothing to hide, don't worry about it.\" But now we don't know what you have to worry about and we don't know what you should have hidden and the things you tried to hide or the things that were protected by government systems are now potentially exposed. And so it's really anyone's guess what could happen and what the consequences could be.\nKatie Drummond: And ironically, as you mentioned earlier, that's part of what makes these lawsuits so challenging to see through because a judge is assessing risk based on hypothetical harms to American citizens as opposed to actual harm or actual injury. Is that right?\nAndrew Couts: I mean it depends on exactly what the lawsuit is alleging or what it's attempting to achieve, what kind of legal standards they're going to apply. But typically judges, if they're looking for actual or potential imminent harm, they're going to be looking at past precedent to say, is it likely that this worst case scenario that is laid out in a hypothetical lawsuit is going to happen? And if they can't find any evidence that has happened in the past, it's entirely plausible that the judge isn't going to rule in favor of the plaintiffs. We can't necessarily rely on history to tell us what's going to happen next, at least not US history. We can look to dictatorships elsewhere in the world potentially, but US history is not going to give us all the information we need to make those calls.\nKatie Drummond: That's right. And we're also still up against this very real possibility, I would argue that a judge rules in one way and that ruling may not actually be adhered to within a federal agency. We've certainly seen a degree of lawlessness and impunity with DOGE's behavior thus far. So I think that sort of adds this extra element of uncertainty where I have been telling people for the last several weeks who are concerned about DOGE, concerned about what Musk is doing. Well, yes, they're moving very quickly. The courts will catch up, the legal system will catch up. That only gets you so far if the administration decides not to adhere to what a judge is saying on a given issue.\nAndrew Couts: Absolutely, and I think the fact that we're even talking about that possibility of the government just ignoring judicial branch rulings, that is an example of how little we can rely on past precedent to show us where the guardrails are here. The guardrails may not exist anymore because they've plowed over them with a cyber truck. It's not a good situation to be in when you're trying to figure out how to operate in this moment and feel safe and secure that your data is protected or you're not going to be targeted for political reasons.\nKatie Drummond: Absolutely. Well, Andrew, there's so much uncertainty right now. In the next few weeks, what would you tell our listeners to pay attention to in the context of DOGE and privacy? Are there certain lawsuits that are particularly salient or particularly interesting? What should they be watching for in the headlines as all of this unfolds?\nAndrew Couts: Well, one, I think we're going to be looking for other instances where we know that specific records have been accessed or we know specifically how they've used the records that they've accessed. WIRED is certainly going to be keeping a close watch on that and doing the reporting to find answers to those questions. But the more we know about what they're actually doing or what the consequences of what they're doing are, the more we're going to be able to assess what the actual risks are. In terms of the lawsuits, I would be paying attention to essentially all of the Privacy Act lawsuits and seeing where those succeed and fail. And those are going to give us specific instances of potentially blocking access to specific records. So the Treasury Department is a good example of one we've already seen, and we're going to want to be getting reassurances that that access actually has been cut off in the instances where there's orders telling them to do so. Because the Privacy Act is really our primary legal blockade against these kinds of abuses that are being alleged in these lawsuits, we really need to know how strong that law actually is. We're also going to be wanting to see whether there are members of Congress attempting to amend change, scrap the Privacy Act, or any other legislation that might be the basis for lawsuits against what the Trump administration is doing. And so paying attention to legislation that's introduced, how that legislation proceeds through Congress is going to be really important as well, because we have to know what the safeguards are, whether they're abided by or not, they have to exist in the first place for us to have any sense of reliance on them.\nKatie Drummond: Got it. And all of those Privacy Act lawsuits, by the way, are listed in WIRED's story that we will link out to for all of you. We're going to take a short break and we'll be back with Andrew in a minute. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I am WIRED's global editorial director, Katie Drummond, here with Andrew Couts, and we are talking all about DOGE and your privacy.\nAndrew, I promise we are almost done. But before we go, you have been an editor at WIRED for several years now, publishing really, really vital work, particularly in the security space. And your team has done a lot of really great reporting that actually helps people understand privacy, data, the sort of personal context around their privacy and sort of what information about them is out there on the internet. But do you have any recommendations from the WIRED archives, from stories that you've edited that might help people either educate themselves about privacy and about data, or at least shore up their own personal security right now?\nAndrew Couts: Yes, though I'll caveat it by saying there's very little we can do about ... If you're going to be targeted by law enforcement or other US federal operatives, there's maybe not that much you can do about it. So I highly recommend people check out the WIRED Guides: Protecting Yourself from Government Surveillance. This was written by two of our senior reporters, Andy Greenberg and Lily Hay Newman. It's a really comprehensive guide on just many steps you can take to protect yourself, protect the systems that you use on a daily basis, and to communicate securely with anyone you're wanting to communicate with. So that's the really practical one. We're talking a lot about the unknown consequences of DOGE having access to these systems, and it made me think of a fun article that our executive editor Brian Barrett wrote back in 2019. It's called How a Null License Plate Landed One Hacker in Ticket Hell. And I think it's just a really good example of how accessing these systems, doing thing in systems can have really unintended consequences. And in this case, this hacker made his license plate null, N-U-L-L, which is also a term that computer programmers use when there's nothing in a field. And through various shenanigans that you can read about in this story, it ended up with him getting $12,000 in tickets because of automated systems detecting his license plate and ticketing him because of his license plate. So I think that's just a really tangible example of how even if DOGE, all their intentions are perfectly innocent and they're really just wanting to save the government money. If they're accessing these systems in ways that they aren't intended to be accessed that way or doing things in those systems that weren't approved by whatever layers of committees approve everything that happens, it can go really badly, even if they don't mean it to. So read WIRED.com. We have a ton of guides out there that will tell you how to kind of lock down all your basic systems, but that's the best you can hope for. If you're hoping to evade being targeted by the Trump administration, hope you can get an EU passport and move to Lithuania or something. I don't know.\nKatie Drummond: Well, we'll see about Lithuania. I will say my entire family has recently migrated to Signal because I said I wouldn't communicate with them if they didn't. So that's great advice. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me today.\nAndrew Couts: Thanks so much for having me.\nKatie Drummond: That's our show.

And so on December 31st of 1974, the Privacy Act was signed into law and basically it limits the ways in which the government can collect, share, or otherwise use people's personal data.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency put a $1 spending limit on most credit cards belonging to employees and contractors of the General Services Administration‚Äîa critical agency that manages IT and office buildings for the US government‚Äîalong with at least three other federal agencies. Similar restrictions are expected to roll out to the entire government workforce soon, according to several sources familiar with the matter.\n‚ÄúEffective immediately, all GSA SmartPay Travel and Purchase Cards issued to GSA employees and contractors are being paused and will not be available for use except in very limited circumstances,‚Äù GSA wrote in a memo to staff Thursday morning viewed by WIRED. The memo later stated that for ‚Äúup to 0.1% of the GSA workforce, requests may be made for certain individual purchase charge card spend thresholds be set above $1. Please provide the rationale for all such deviations on an employee-by-employee basis along with the proposed increased threshold.‚Äù\nThe GSA, one of the first agencies that Musk allies infiltrated after DOGE was established, manages the SmartPay program for more than 250 federal agencies and organizations. The SmartPay website claims it is ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs largest government charge card and commercial payment solutions program.‚Äù\nThe spending freeze comes after DOGE posted on X earlier this week that it was working to ‚Äúsimplify‚Äù the government credit card program and ‚Äúreduce costs.‚Äù\nThe restrictions immediately apply to GSA, the Office of Personnel Management, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and the United States Agency for International Development, according to a source with direct knowledge of the project. All four of the agencies have been prominent targets of DOGE in recent weeks. Employees who spoke with WIRED say the changes will result in enormous complications to their existing workflows and that excessive or fraudulent spending is rare. Those who‚Äôve already received approval for travel expenses (and may currently be traveling) have to request a temporary spending limit increase, the sources say.\nOne important reason that federal employees typically put expenses on special government-issued credit cards is to ensure they avoid paying state sales tax on things like hotels and rental cars, which federal agencies are supposed to be exempt from. The GSA‚Äôs website states that the state sales tax exemption is ‚Äúdetermined by method of payment,‚Äù not by the employee‚Äôs ability to prove they work for the federal government.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at zoeschiffer.87.\nAs DOGE attempts to cut billions of dollars from the federal budget, Elon Musk has been posting examples of alleged ‚Äúfraud‚Äù his team has uncovered to his over 218 million followers on X. In some cases, reporting from WIRED and other outlets suggests DOGE may be misinterpreting or misrepresenting what they‚Äôve found.\nFor example, Musk has falsely claimed that 150-year-olds were receiving Social Security benefits. Experts told WIRED that DOGE likely overlooked a quirk in the payments system that doles out these benefits, which automatically sets a person‚Äôs birthday to May 20, 1875 if the real date is unknown, making these individuals appear to be 150 in the system.\nThe new spending restrictions apply to both SmartPay travel and purchase cards. Travel cards are widely used across the government (for example, most army reservists have these cards). The government tracks travel expenses, like hotel and airline fees, through software tools like Concur. The GSA already requires receipts for any purchase that its employees make over $75. ‚ÄúThe system is a pain in the ass and requires authorization from a supervisor before any money can be spent,‚Äù says a current GSA employee.\nOnce a trip is done, employees have to submit a voucher that matches the approved expenses. Expenses are scrupulously tracked‚Äîemployees are told to minimize ATM withdrawals to avoid unnecessary fees, according to a current GSA employee, who like the others in this story, spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. They say misusing a card is already grounds for disciplinary action, including termination.\nPurchase cards are more rare and are used for work expenses under $10,000; anything above this amount requires a formal government contract. They‚Äôre used for office supplies, IT equipment, and trainings, among other things. If employees want to spend money on a purchase card, they have to submit a form, which then needs to be approved and signed by a supervisor. When that‚Äôs done, the form is submitted for approval to the approving office, with the name of the person who wants to make the purchase, a description of the item, the estimated price, an accounting code, and the date when the goods or services are needed.\nOnce the payment is approved, it‚Äôs assigned a purchase request number. Only then can the employee actually spend money. If they spend 10 percent more than the approved amount, they need written approval again. At the GSA, each purchase is tracked through a program called Pegasys, which requires a separate form to access. Pegasys has two sides: The purchase side, which shows the money that was spent, and the reconciliation side. The card holder has to match these two sides, cent for cent, using the request number.\n‚ÄúTo commit fraud, you‚Äôd have to have the employee, supervisor, and likely someone in finance in on it,‚Äù says another current GSA employee. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not as easy as [DOGE is] claiming.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "An asteroid discovered late last year is continuing to stir public interest as its odds of striking planet Earth less than eight years from now continue to increase.\nTwo weeks ago, when Ars first wrote about the asteroid, designated 2024 YR4, NASA‚Äôs Center for Near Earth Object Studies estimated a 1.9 percent chance of an impact with Earth in 2032. NASA‚Äôs most recent estimate has the likelihood of a strike increasing to 3.2 percent. Now that‚Äôs not particularly high, but it‚Äôs also not zero.\nNaturally the prospect of a large ball of rock tens of meters across striking the planet is a little worrisome. This is large enough to cause localized devastation near its impact site, likely on the order of the Tunguska event of 1908, which leveled some 500 square miles (1,295 square kilometers) of forest in remote Siberia.\nTo understand why the odds from NASA are changing and whether we should be concerned about 2024 YR4, Ars connected with Robin George Andrews, author of the recently published book How to Kill an Asteroid. Good timing with the publication date, eh?\nArs: Why are the impact odds increasing?\nRobin George Andrews: The asteroid‚Äôs orbit is not known to a great deal of precision right now, as we only have a limited number of telescopic observations of it. However, even as the rock zips farther away from Earth, certain telescopes are still managing to spy it and extend our knowledge of the asteroid‚Äôs orbital arc around the sun. The odds have fluctuated in both directions over the last few weeks, but overall, they have risen; that‚Äôs because the amount of uncertainty astronomers have as to its true orbit has shrunk, but Earth has yet to completely fall out of that zone of uncertainty. As a proportion of the remaining uncertainty, Earth is taking up more space, so for now, its odds are rising.\nThink of it like a beam of light coming out of the front of that asteroid. That beam of light shrinks as we get to know its orbit better, but if Earth is yet to fall out of that beam, it takes up proportionally more space. So, for a while, the asteroid‚Äôs impact odds rise. It‚Äôs very likely that, with sufficient observations, Earth will fall out of that shrinking beam of light eventually, and the impact odds will suddenly fall to zero. The alternative, of course, is that they‚Äôll rise close to 100 percent.\nWhat are we learning about the asteroid‚Äôs destructive potential?\nThe damage it could cause would be localized to a roughly city-sized area, so if it hits the middle of the ocean or a vast desert, nothing would happen. But it could trash a city, or completely destroy much of one, with a direct hit.\nThe key factor here (if you had to pick one) is the asteroid‚Äôs mass. Each time the asteroid gets twice as long (presuming it‚Äôs roughly spherical), it brings with it 8 times more kinetic energy. So if the asteroid is on the smaller end of the estimated size range‚Äî40 meters‚Äîthen it will be as if a small nuclear bomb exploded in the sky. At that size, unless it‚Äôs very iron-rich, it wouldn‚Äôt survive its atmospheric plunge, so it would explode in mid-air. There would be modest-to-severe structural damage right below the blast, and minor to moderate structural damage over tens of miles. A 90-meter asteroid would, whether it makes it to the ground or not, be more than 10 times more energetic; a large nuclear weapon blast, then. A large city would be severely damaged, and the area below the blast would be annihilated.\nDo we have any idea where the asteroid might strike on Earth?\nThe ‚Äúrisk corridor‚Äù is currently spread over parts of the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, parts of Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia. Additional observations will ultimately narrow this down, if an impact remains possible.\nWhat key observations are we still waiting for that might clarify the threat?\nMost telescopes will lose sight of this ‚Äúsmall‚Äù asteroid in the coming weeks. But the James Webb Space Telescope will be able to track it until May. For the first time, it‚Äôs been authorized for planetary defense purposes, largely because its infrared eye allows it to track the asteroid further out than optical light telescopes. JWST will not only improve our understanding of its orbit, but also constrain its size. First observations should appear by the end of March.\nJWST may rule out an impact in 2032. But there‚Äôs a chance we may be stuck with a few-percentage impact probability until 2028, when the asteroid makes its next Earth flyby. Bit awkward, if so.\nNASA‚Äôs DART mission successfully shifted an asteroid‚Äôs orbit in 2022. Could this technology be used?\nNot necessarily. DART‚Äîa type of spacecraft called a kinetic impactor‚Äîwas a great success. But it still only changed Dimorphos‚Äô orbit by a small amount. Ideally, you want many years of advance notice to deflect an asteroid with something like DART to ensure the asteroid has moved out of Earth‚Äôs way. I‚Äôve often been told that at least 10 years prior to impact is best if you want to be sure to deflect a city-killing-size asteroid. That‚Äôs not to say deflection is impossible; it just becomes trickier to pull off. You can‚Äôt just hit it with a colossal spacecraft, because you may fragment it into several still-dangerously sized pieces. Hit it too softly, and it will still hit Earth, but somewhere that wasn‚Äôt originally going to be hit. You have to be super careful here.\nSome rather clever scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (which has a superb planetary defense contingent) worked out that, for a 90-meter asteroid, you need 10 years to confidently deflect it with a kinetic impactor to prevent an Earth impact. So, to deflect 2024 YR4, if it‚Äôs 90 meters long and we have just a few years of time, we‚Äôd probably need a bigger impactor spacecraft (but don‚Äôt break it!)‚Äîor we‚Äôd need several kinetic impactors to deflect it (but each has to work perfectly).\nEight years until impact is a little tight. It‚Äôs not impossible that the choice would be made to use a nuclear weapon to deflect it; this could be very awkward geopolitically, but a nuke would impart a bigger deflection than an equivalent DART-like spacecraft. Or, maybe, they‚Äôd opt to try and vaporize the asteroid with something like a 1-megaton nuke, which LLNL says would work with an asteroid this size.\nSo it‚Äôs kind of late in the game to be planning an impact mission?\nThis isn‚Äôt an ideal situation. And humanity has never tried to stop an asteroid impact for real. I imagine that if 2024 YR4 does become an agreed-upon emergency, the DART team (JHUAP plus NASA, mostly) would join forces with SpaceX (and other space agencies, particularly ESA but probably others) to quickly build the right-mass kinetic impactor (or impactors) and get ready for a deflection attempt close to 2028, when the asteroid makes its next Earth flyby. But yeah, eight years is not too much time.\nA deflection could work! But it won‚Äôt be as simple as just hitting the asteroid really hard in 2028.\nHow important is NASA to planetary defense?\nPlanetary defense is an international security concern. But right now, NASA (and America, by extension) is the vanguard. Its planetary defenders are the watchers on the wall, the people most responsible for not just finding these potentially hazardous asteroids before they find us, but also those most capable of developing and deploying tech to prevent any impacts. America is the only nation with (for now!) a well-funded near-Earth object-hunting program, and is the only nation to have tested out a planetary defense technique. It‚Äôs a movie clich√© that America is the only nation capable of saving the world from cosmic threats. But, for the time being‚Äîeven with amazing planetary defense mission contributions from ESA and JAXA‚Äîthat clich√© remains absolutely true.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

Learn more.\nI was leaving a blissful session with my massage therapist when she pointed out something unexpected: I was developing an ever-so-slight neck ‚Äúhump.‚Äù Of course, nobody wants to hear that‚Äîit sounds unsightly‚Äîbut it also raised some alarm bells. Recently, an orthopedic spine surgeon told me that he‚Äôs seen increasing cases of arthritis in young, healthy individuals, likely due to posture issues caused by constant screen use.\nLike most desk workers, I spend at least 30 hours a week glued to my laptop or hunched over my phone. But I work out every day and had what I thought was decent posture‚Äîenough, I figured, to counteract some of the negative effects. Yet modern life seems to be conspiring against us. Even with regular breaks, prolonged screen time molds our bodies into less-than-ideal shapes‚Äîtight hip flexors, rounded shoulders, and a forward head tilt.\nDetermined to address this before it worsened, I found the Chirp Wheel XR, a rolling device for the spine designed to ‚Äúdecompress the spin‚Äù and relieve tension.\nReversing the Curse\nI‚Äôve always dabbled in stretching and yoga, but neither ever offered more than mild relief. Maybe with a little more patience and a little more time dedicated to my movement practice, I‚Äôd be cured.\nBut not all of us can afford an hour a day dedicated to stretching. So I started using the Chirp Wheel for 10 minutes a day, and I‚Äôve tested multiple sizes (including a 4-inch diameter neck-specific model and the 10-inch smooth wheel), but the one I keep going back to is the knobby 6-inch ‚Äúknot kneader.‚Äù\nThe device is simple: A wheel, perfectly circular, with a plastic core and firm rubber exterior that feels about as dense as a foam roller. Along the center, there‚Äôs a groove where your spine lines up, so you don‚Äôt feel pressure on the bony protrusions. (Chirp calls this the ‚Äúspinal canal.‚Äù) Along the edges, there are large circular nodules and smaller ones that dig into knots. The brand claims it mimics a shiatsu massage, which is debatable, but it certainly applies strong pressure.\nCompared to Chirp‚Äôs smooth wheels, which are padded with rubber and are apparently better for general stretching and chest opening, the knobby one delivers a deeper, more intense sensation. It‚Äôs effective at hitting pressure points‚Äîlike a lacrosse ball trigger-point massage but much easier to use.\nRolling Process\nWhen you‚Äôre sitting all day, your spine rounds forward into flexion. The Chirp Wheel encourages spinal extension, a position most people rarely experience unless they actively incorporate yoga poses like cat-cow or the conveniently named ‚Äúwheel‚Äù pose.\nThe key is easing into it‚Äîyou don‚Äôt want to jump into extreme extension too quickly. The first time I used it, I knew that my body was desperate for the help but that it would take some time. The 10-inch wheel, marketed as the most gentle experience, was so difficult I could barely hold the position for 30 seconds.\nInitially, I positioned it at my lower back and‚Äîso slowly, so gently‚Äîarched over it. My hips stayed on the floor, so I wasn‚Äôt adding extra weight. I could barely drape myself over it, much less roll up or down. Every muscle in my body braced against the stretch.\nThe next day, I kept my hips grounded but slowly rolled the wheel along my spine by pushing into my feet. When I reached my upper back and traps‚Äîthe muscles I hunch up to my ears when I‚Äôm typing‚ÄîI had to ease off.\nEach day, I added a little more pressure, rolling out for longer. Less than three weeks later, I can fully lift my hips off the floor and let my body weight rest‚Äîand actually relax‚Äîon the wheel. Now, I start with a full spine rollout, then move my arms overhead as I focus on my upper back. As I‚Äôve loosened up, I‚Äôve gotten small, satisfying pops as my back cracks.\nYou can also lay passively on the Chirp Wheel, allowing all of the surrounding muscles to relax and getting a deep opening across the chest and front shoulders.\nA Few Small Downsides\nWhile I‚Äôve had a great experience with my Chirp Wheel, some Reddit users have mentioned that the plastic has cracked under their weight. To lessen this risk, make sure the wheel is centered on your spine‚Äîit‚Äôs easy for it to get off-kilter, which can create uneven pressure. The company claims the wheel supports up to 500 pounds (227 kilograms) and offers a one-year warranty if the core cracks.\nOther tools, like foam rollers and massage guns, are more versatile than the Chirp‚Äîthough I never experienced as much relief with either. This wheel is designed for the spine, and while you can use it to awkwardly massage the hamstring or calf, it‚Äôs not ideal for much else. With a lacrosse ball or massage gun, you can pinpoint specific muscles in a way the Chirp can‚Äôt.\nBut at $50 for the 6-inch wheel, it‚Äôs cheaper than most recovery gadgets, and there‚Äôs no motor to break or battery life to contend with. I saw results faster than with stretching alone, but it still took about a week of daily sessions to notice major improvements.\nBrain Fog Banished\nIt‚Äôs been a month, but I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say I can‚Äôt imagine life without my Chirp Wheel. I use it during midday computer breaks, and it‚Äôs the first thing I reach for when I get home from the gym. My daily comfort has improved, and my exercises are starting to feel much easier. When I took a recent Pilates class (which requires spinal mobility‚Äînot usually my forte), I no longer felt like the Tin Man. My spine felt flexy and my movements fluid. I felt more in control of my core.\nThe most surprising side effect? Eliminating my brain fog. I used to experience it almost daily‚Äîsometimes to a debilitating level where I‚Äôd need breath work or a nap to regain focus. After a week on this thing, I was‚Äîand remain‚Äîbrain-fog-free. My best guess is that the brain fog was stemming from tight muscles in my neck and upper back, which could restrict blood flow and cause tension. There is no research directly linking tight muscles and brain fog, so this is just conjecture on my part. But for me, it's a pronounced effect, and I struggle to see it as a mere coincidence.\nNo single tool is going to fix years of poor posture overnight, but the Chirp Wheel has made a real difference. While it‚Äôs too early to know for sure if my dreaded hump has gone down, my upper back and neck are certainly more relaxed, my muscles have loosened up so they don‚Äôt feel like rocks, and I‚Äôm much more aware of my posture throughout the day.\nMoreover, using it throughout the work day makes me feel like I‚Äôm taking small steps to combat my tech neck. It‚Äôs simple, effective, and‚Äîunlike the countless recovery tools I‚Äôve tried before‚Äîsomething I actually want to keep using. If you too slump in your seat, it‚Äôs definitely worth adding to your routine.",

This wheel is designed for the spine, and while you can use it to awkwardly massage the hamstring or calf, it‚Äôs not ideal for much else. With a lacrosse ball or massage gun, you can pinpoint specific muscles in a way the Chirp can‚Äôt.</p><p class=\"paywall\">But at $50 for the 6-inch wheel, it‚Äôs cheaper than most recovery gadgets, and there‚Äôs no motor to break or battery life to contend with. I saw results faster than with stretching alone, but it still took about a week of daily sessions to notice major improvements.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>The 4-inch diameter Chirp wheel is the specific model that can supposedly help with ‚Äútech neck.‚Äù</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Chirp</span></div></figure><h2 class=\"paywall\">Brain Fog Banished</h2><p class=\"paywall\">It‚Äôs been a month, but I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say I can‚Äôt imagine life without my Chirp Wheel. I use it during midday computer breaks, and it‚Äôs the first thing I reach for when I get home from the gym. My daily comfort has improved, and my exercises are starting to feel much easier. When I took a recent Pilates class (which requires spinal mobility‚Äînot usually my forte), I no longer felt like the Tin Man. My spine felt flexy and my movements fluid. I felt more in control of my core.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The most surprising side effect? Eliminating my brain fog. I used to experience it almost daily‚Äîsometimes to a debilitating level where I‚Äôd need breath work or a nap to regain focus. After a week on this thing, I was‚Äîand remain‚Äîbrain-fog-free. My best guess is that the brain fog was stemming from tight muscles in my neck and upper back, which could restrict blood flow and cause tension. There is no research directly linking tight muscles and brain fog, so this is just conjecture on my part. But for me, it's a pronounced effect, and I struggle to see it as a mere coincidence.</p><p class=\"paywall\">No single tool is going to fix years of poor posture overnight, but the Chirp Wheel has made a real difference. While it‚Äôs too early to know for sure if my dreaded hump has gone down, my upper back and neck are certainly more relaxed, my muscles have loosened up so they don‚Äôt feel like rocks, and I‚Äôm much more aware of my posture throughout the day.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Moreover, using it throughout the work day makes me feel like I‚Äôm taking small steps to combat my tech neck. It‚Äôs simple, effective, and‚Äîunlike the countless recovery tools I‚Äôve tried before‚Äîsomething I actually want to keep using. If you too slump in your seat, it‚Äôs definitely worth adding to your routine.</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nThere's nothing like watching your favorite films in a dark room on a massive screen. For that authentic movie theater experience at home, you‚Äôll need a projector (and a popcorn maker).\nYou used to have to shell out more than $10,000 to get an excellent projected experience, but you can now get a massive, beautiful picture for less than the cost of a flagship TV. Projectors are also much more portable and easier to set up than ever. And if you have space, there are excellent pocket-sized and short-throw models that make lawn-side movie nights as easy as finding an extension cord and a level chair to set them on. Below are our favorite models and a couple of screens to pair with them.\nWorking on a total home-theater overhaul and need some help? We've got an entire guide on How to Set Up a Projector. Also, be sure to check out our buying guides to the Best Soundbars and Best 4K Streaming Devices.\nUpdated February 2025: We added the Hisense PX3-Pro, XGIMI Horizon S Max and MoGo 3 Pro, and mentioned the Samsung The Premiere 9 and Dangbei DBOX02.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

That's why we have an entire guide to How to Buy a Projector to check out!\nUnless you're going for a portable option, you'll want to make sure you have a projector mount ($20) and HDMI cable properly routed to the location of your projector. This is because setting up full-size projectors to fit your screen, be in focus, etc., can be a pain, so once you get everything dialed in, you'll want to leave it as-is.\nMake Sure Your Projector Is Bright Enough\nMake sure you get enough lumens (how bright your projector will get at its peak, the higher the number the better). Over 2,000 lumens is a good starting space for any kind of lit viewing, but we recommend 3000 or above if you're viewing in a bright room. Anything under 1,000 lumens is only really worth it as a portable projector for the darkest rooms or after dark.\nWithout a completely dark room, the image can look washed out and be hard to see. If you don't have a room without windows, consider getting blackout curtains. For more detailed information on how to set up a projector after it arrives, I highly recommend this video.\nMake Sure There's Space for Your Image!\nThe biggest thing to bear in mind before you get a projector is just how much space you'll need to properly set it up. In most cases, you'll need 10 to 15 feet between the screen and the projector (be sure to check the ‚Äúthrow distance‚Äù listed by the manufacturer in the manual) to achieve screen sizes over 100 inches, unless you're getting a short throw model.",

    "content_text": "A WIRED investigation into the inner workings of Google‚Äôs advertising ecosystem reveals that a wealth of sensitive information on Americans is being openly served up to some of the world‚Äôs largest brands despite the company‚Äôs own rules against it. Experts say that when combined with other data, this information could be used to identify and target specific individuals.\nDisplay & Video 360 (DV360), one of the dominant marketing platforms offered by the search giant, is offering companies globally the option of targeting devices in the United States based on lists of internet users believed to suffer from chronic illnesses and financial distress, among other categories of personal data that are ostensibly banned under Google‚Äôs public policies.\nOther lists of American users accessible for a price across the platform raise serious national security concerns, experts say, as they reveal data brokers striving to isolate millions of mobile devices carried by government workers‚Äîfrom US judges and military service members to executive agency staff and employees on Capitol Hill.\nFirst reviewed by WIRED, an internal spreadsheet obtained from a US-based data broker shows the DV360 platform currently hosting hundreds if not thousands of restricted or otherwise sensitive ‚Äúaudience segments,‚Äù each containing a large tranche of data that points to countless mobile devices and online profiles of people in the US. The segments are generated not by Google, but by DV360 customers who upload them to the system, where others can use them to target ads at specific audiences.\nThe data‚Äîfirst obtained by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), Ireland's oldest independent human rights body‚Äîreveals segments targeting hundreds of millions of device users based exclusively on health conditions, from chronic pain and menopause to, among others, fibromyalgia, psoriasis, arthritis, high cholesterol, and hypertension.\n‚ÄúAs with other demand-side platforms, advertisers are able to upload audience lists to Display & Video 360, based either on their own first-party data or from segment providers,‚Äù says Erica Walsh, a Google spokesperson. ‚ÄúOur policies do not permit audience segments to be used based on sensitive information like employment, health conditions, financial status, etc.‚Äù\nDespite this, numerous segments contained in the data are clearly targeted at households and businesses based purely on data suggesting they‚Äôre experiencing financial hardship‚Äîaiming, for instance, to help advertisers identify people who are in the process of bankruptcy or burdened by long-term debt.\nAllison Bodack, another Google spokesperson, tells WIRED that when the company detects ‚Äúnon-compliant audience segments, we will take action.‚Äù Asked to explain why Google had not detected segments with descriptions such as ‚ÄúIndividuals likely to have a Cardiovascular condition,‚Äù or ‚ÄúParents of children likely to have a respiratory disease, like Asthma,‚Äù Bodack did not respond.\nSegments accessible through DV360 that target Americans with asthma contain at least hundreds of millions of mobile IDs‚Äîamong them, a list simply titled, ‚ÄúPeople who have asthma.‚Äù Hundreds of millions more were found on lists for no other reason than the fact that their users are believed to have diabetes. A vast number of devices and user profiles are spread out across lists that target users determined likely to need specific medications, including some controlled substances, such as Ambien. One list links more than 140 million mobile IDs to opioid usage, suggesting the users need relief from a common \"opioid-induced\" side effect.\nGoogle did not respond when asked whether a data broker had violated its rules by offering advertisers access to a list of people ‚Äúlikely to have an Endocrine disorder.‚Äù (The company only stated that its policies ‚Äúdo not permit‚Äù such segments ‚Äúto be used.‚Äù) Asked to explain whether it assigns any level of risk to audience segments that target US government employees working in national security jobs, or contractors with access to restricted US defense-related technologies, Google‚Äôs spokespeople did not respond.\nAmong a list of 33,000 audience segments obtained by the ICCL, WIRED identified several that aimed to identify people working sensitive government jobs. One, for instance, targets US government employees who are considered ‚Äúdecision makers‚Äù working ‚Äúspecifically in the field of national security.‚Äù Another targets individuals who work at companies registered with the State Department to manufacture and export defense-related technologies, from missiles and space launch vehicles to cryptographic systems that house classified military and intelligence data.\nSources with firsthand knowledge of Google‚Äôs platform, granted condition of anonymity to protect against retaliation on the job, confirmed the segments were actually accessible to Google‚Äôs ad buyers. Unlike Google Ads, which is free and typically used by individuals and small businesses, DV360 is a paid platform primarily aimed at companies that spend over $50,000 in ad buys per month. Google‚Äôs DV360 partners include the likes of Disney and NBCUniversal.\n‚ÄúThis is exactly the kind of seemingly obscure data that would pique a foreign adversary's interest,‚Äù says Justin Sherman, CEO of Global Cyber Strategies, and author of the upcoming book Navigating Technology and National Security. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not necessarily held in every dataset, but it speaks to a medical condition, it speaks to use of a powerful drug, and it speaks to something that could potentially be exploited in an intelligence context.‚Äù\nOver the last decade or so, online advertising has evolved to include technologies capable of ‚Äúmicro-targeting‚Äù individuals based on surveillance data gathered from a wide variety of sources. Users are grouped into ‚Äúsegments‚Äù by data brokers who aim to isolate individuals with the help of unique mobile identifiers‚Äîalphanumeric strings that are assigned to mobile devices and are widely shared across the advertising ecosystem. These mobile IDs are employed to not only track a user‚Äôs movements but their online habits, including which apps they use, and are regularly combined with ‚Äúcookies‚Äù that track web browsing behavior and purchasing information.\nWhile the purpose of mobile IDs and other ad-based identifiers is, ostensibly, to help shield users‚Äô identities, it is no secret that when combined with other datasets, it can become trivial to re-identify people whose information has been ‚Äúanonymized.‚Äù\nA government report declassified by the US Office of National Intelligence in June 2023 notes that commercial data may be combined to ‚Äúreverse engineer identities or deanonymize various forms of information.‚Äù Advisers to the nation‚Äôs top spy at the time, Avril Haines, added in the report: ‚ÄúIn the wrong hands, sensitive insights gained through [commercially available information] could facilitate blackmail, stalking, harassment, and public shaming.‚Äù\nDemonstrating the point, many data brokers that exist on the periphery of Google‚Äôs advertising exchange work to assist marketers by crafting complex dossiers on individual consumers, ‚Äúenriching‚Äù anonymized profiles with information drawn from a range of public and government sources. Frequently this includes credit card transactions, social media posts, bankruptcy filings, vehicle registration records, employment records, and hoards of web tracking data quietly amassed from websites, apps, and IoT devices.\nWith such access, data brokers aim to craft customized lists of potential targets, such as people who have ‚Äúcareers in the armed forces‚Äù and enjoy ‚Äúgambling in general,‚Äù or those who are an ‚Äúactive conservative voter‚Äù likely to ‚Äúparticipate in a civil protest,‚Äù according to the ICCL-provided data.\nThe manner in which the data was originally acquired by the ICCL provides a quintessential example of the ease with which rival foreign intelligence agencies can gain access to Americans‚Äô data with minimal effort. Johnny Ryan, director of Enforce, ICCL‚Äôs investigative branch, says he was surprised by how easy the access came. ‚ÄúI was prepared for a complex process that would test my cover story,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbut when I signed up there was no questions asked whatsoever.‚Äù\nTo gain access to the data broker‚Äôs segments, Ryan created a website for a fake ‚Äúdata analytics‚Äù firm. The ‚Äúcompany‚Äù isn‚Äôt registered anywhere officially, but exists solely as a handful of web pages. On them, Ryan placed an image of a Russian soldier, apparently in the midst of combat, alongside a map of Ukraine. The firm‚Äôs work is vaguely described as helping ‚Äúselect clients‚Äù obtain ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù awareness of ‚Äútargets‚Äù in the field. Ryan used this implausible cover while approaching data brokers based in the US.\n‚ÄúI could have been anybody,‚Äù he says.\nTo protect the integrity of ongoing research, WIRED agreed to delay identifying any data brokers being monitored by the ICCL.\nRyan‚Äôs research into ad-tech abuse informed a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit brought in 2024 against Mobilewalla, a data broker that, the FTC claims, widely offered access to segments used ‚Äúspecifically‚Äù to target ‚Äúpregnant women and young mothers,‚Äù while also selling mobile IDs that tracked people visiting medical facilities and domestic abuse shelters. (Similarly, WIRED identified segments in the ICCL‚Äôs data that linked millions of mobile devices to expectant mothers, as well as more than 140 lists that referenced a ‚Äúpropensity‚Äù for ‚Äúdisease.‚Äù Fifty-one million mobile IDs belong to a segment aimed specifically at women likely to lack preventive care.)\nAccording to the FTC government complaint, Mobilewalla collected more than 183 million mobile IDs in 2021 alone. Between 2018 and 2020, the company sourced roughly 60 percent of its data directly from real-time bidding (RTB) exchanges, marketplaces where advertisers compete for online ad space in lightning-fast auctions.\nA complaint filed by Enforce and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) last month urges the FTC to launch an investigation into whether Google‚Äôs RTB tools have allowed sensitive data to be made available to foreign adversaries‚Äîinformation that Ryan, along with other experts, says includes vast troves of personal data tied to ‚Äúactive military, intelligence personnel, and key leaders.‚Äù\nMany of the conditions, behaviors, and traits reflected in the data, such as a likelihood of financial debt, propensity for high alcohol use, and certain medical conditions, are criteria that can adversely affect a federal employee‚Äôs eligibility to access classified information‚Äîillustrating the potential of its use for blackmail purposes.\nEPIC and Enforce allege that Google both ‚Äúdirectly‚Äù and ‚Äúindirectly‚Äù provides foreign adversaries, including China, with ‚Äúextraordinarily sensitive‚Äù commercial data concerning ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs leaders and sensitive defense personnel,‚Äù while pointing the finger at Google as the predominant commercial entity behind a vast and widely ignored ‚Äúnational security crisis.‚Äù\n‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs purported self-regulation cannot protect us,‚Äù says EPIC senior counsel Sara Geoghegan, whose complaint points to restrictions on data broker deals cemented last year under a new federal law, the Protecting Americans‚Äô Data from Foreign Adversaries Act (PADFAA). According to Geoghegan, Google‚Äôs advertising tools pose a unique national threat, one that Congress has specifically charged the FTC with eliminating.\nGoogle‚Äôs spokesperson Erica Walsh denies any wrongdoing on the part of the company, saying that, for instance, while Google‚Äôs ad exchanges continue to accept business from Chinese companies, it has long since ceased sharing data with Russian entities. Last year, she says, Google introduced a new system designed to identify companies with ties to China in order to restrict the types of information they receive about US consumers. ‚ÄúThis means we never share data tied to a specific user in the US for bid requests to those known entities,‚Äù she says.\nWhile the FTC has yet to introduce any cases based on PADFAA‚Äîand also declined to comment for this story‚Äîthe law notably extends far beyond data that is merely ‚Äútied to a specific user.‚Äù Google and other US companies are now forbidden under law from providing companies with ties to hostile nations with any information that, no matter how anonymized, can be tied back to a specific user when combined ‚Äúwith other data.‚Äù\nChina is reported to have the world‚Äôs largest security and intelligence apparatus, employing a veritable army of hackers that have spent decades infiltrating US corporations and agencies to steal data, most recently compromising at least 11 of the nation‚Äôs telecommunications networks.\n‚ÄúIt would be a joke for the Chinese government to link a mobile ad ID to a person's name,‚Äù says Sherman of Global Cyber Strategies.\nWalsh notes that under Google‚Äôs new rules, mobile IDs are automatically stripped from RTB data served to Chinese entities. Along with other identifiers, Google also redacts the location data of devices being served the ads, limiting what Chinese companies can see to the name of a city. Google will provide the URL of a web page or the name of an app that an American is using, it says, but only in real time.\nTo ensure compliance, Walsh says, Google employs an independent company to ‚Äúregularly‚Äù audit its authorized RTB buyers. Google declined to reveal more about the audits, but its public documentation suggests they are conducted at Google‚Äôs expense, ‚Äúno more than once during each 12 month period.‚Äù\nZach Edwards, a longtime advertising-industry researcher and senior threat researcher at cybersecurity firm Silent Push, says Google‚Äôs efforts to limit the flow of data to China may ultimately have little effect. When a company wins a bid and its ad is served on a web page, he says, it becomes possible to acquire much of the same data that Google preemptively redacts, including a user's full IP address and detailed information about the device they are using. Chinese hackers have reportedly used this technique in the past to execute malicious code on millions of users‚Äô devices‚Äîa threat known as ‚Äúmalvertising.‚Äù\n‚ÄúRedacting the bid request is totally moot,‚Äù Edward says. ‚ÄúIf you take tens of millions of dollars from Chinese advertisers and don‚Äôt blink at them buying every impression, they outbid everyone and are able to get on the page.‚Äù According to recent reports, Chinese companies are spending ‚Äúhuge sums‚Äù on ads targeting US consumers, netting major profits for Meta, X, YouTube, and similar Silicon Valley firms that dominate the digital advertising market. In a February 2024 earnings call, Meta said that ‚ÄúChina-based advertisers represented 10 percent of our overall revenue‚Äù for 2023, which totaled $133 billion.\n‚ÄúEven if Google were to change its practices and only initially broadcast RTB data to entities in the United States,‚Äù EPIC‚Äôs complaint says, the data would ‚Äúinevitably‚Äù fall into foreign actors‚Äô hands. ‚ÄúGoogle has no way to control what happens to the data that it broadcasts so freely,‚Äù it alleges. This was also the contention of the organization that develops technical standards for the advertising industry. Known as the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), the organization acknowledged in 2018 that there is ‚Äúno technical way to limit the way data is used after the data is received by a vendor.‚Äù\nForeign actors and private surveillance firms have been caught routinely exploiting RTB systems by creating shell advertising companies in order to access bid-stream data: information on users broadcast between the demand and supply sides of an RTB auction. In 2022, Adalytics, a digital ad analysis firm, published a report alleging that Google was sharing RTB data with RuTarget, an ad-tech firm owned by Russia‚Äôs largest state bank; activity that Google says it ceased in response. In 2023, Bloomberg reported that, by operating its own demand-side platform, an Israeli surveillance company called Rayzone had gained direct access to Google‚Äôs RTB data.\nLast year, 404 Media reported on another Israeli tool called Patternz that was for leveraging access to Google‚Äôs system in the same manner.\nSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who has authored legislation that would ban federal agencies from buying data that normally requires a warrant, says the fact that Google‚Äôs platform provides overseas companies access to any personal data on military and intelligence personnel is an ‚Äúoutrageous practice.‚Äù ‚ÄúFederal regulators should throw the book at Google,‚Äù he believes, ‚Äúand cut off the company from federal contracts until it stops exposing our troops to harm.‚Äù\nInternal Google communications cited by EPIC and Enforce reveal a historical reluctance by Google to take practical steps to remedy the problem, despite company leaders internally acknowledging the risk. A 2014 exchange, first revealed during a federal antitrust case two years ago, shows one senior executive acknowledging the ‚Äúdifficulty in figuring out what buyers are actually doing with the data we're sending.‚Äù\nThe remark prompted another executive to inquire as to what the ‚Äúfinancial impact‚Äù may be of actually addressing the problem.\nIn another document, from late 2021, Google‚Äôs chief marketing officer, Lorraine Twohill, advises CEO Sundar Pichai to move the company away from real-time bidding, telling him: ‚ÄúUsers point to our ads as THE reason why they can't trust Google and why they think we sell their personal information to 3rd parties.‚Äù\nTwohill‚Äôs letter‚Äîsent on International Data Privacy Day‚Äîmakes clear her opinion of Google‚Äôs advertising practices: ‚Äúreal time bidding on user data = bad,‚Äù she writes, before signing off, ‚ÄúYour privacy obsessed pal.‚Äù",

The segments are generated not by Google, but by DV360 customers who upload them to the system, where others can use them to target ads at specific audiences.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">The data‚Äîfirst obtained by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), Ireland's oldest independent human rights body‚Äîreveals segments targeting hundreds of millions of device users based exclusively on health conditions, from chronic pain and menopause to, among others, fibromyalgia, psoriasis, arthritis, high cholesterol, and hypertension.</p><p class=\"paywall\">‚ÄúAs with other demand-side platforms, advertisers are able to upload audience lists to Display &amp; Video 360, based either on their own first-party data or from segment providers,‚Äù says Erica Walsh, a Google spokesperson. ‚ÄúOur policies do not permit audience segments to be used based on sensitive information like employment, health conditions, financial status, etc.‚Äù</p><p class=\"paywall\">Despite this, numerous segments contained in the data are clearly targeted at households and businesses based purely on data suggesting they‚Äôre experiencing financial hardship‚Äîaiming, for instance, to help advertisers identify people who are in the process of bankruptcy or burdened by long-term debt.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Allison Bodack, another Google spokesperson, tells WIRED that when the company detects ‚Äúnon-compliant audience segments, we will take action.‚Äù Asked to explain why Google had not detected segments with descriptions such as ‚ÄúIndividuals likely to have a Cardiovascular condition,‚Äù or ‚ÄúParents of children likely to have a respiratory disease, like Asthma,‚Äù Bodack did not respond.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Segments accessible through DV360 that target Americans with asthma contain at least hundreds of millions of mobile IDs‚Äîamong them, a list simply titled, ‚ÄúPeople who have asthma.‚Äù Hundreds of millions more were found on lists for no other reason than the fact that their users are believed to have diabetes. A vast number of devices and user profiles are spread out across lists that target users determined likely to need specific medications, including some controlled substances, such as Ambien. One list links more than 140 million mobile IDs to opioid usage, suggesting the users need relief from a common \"opioid-induced\" side effect.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Within just the last week or so, Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE hit team of mostly young, almost exclusively male engineers and executives have done the following:\n- Pushed a website live to track ‚Äúsavings‚Äù that showed no savings for several days and made it trivially easy for random people on the internet to make changes to it.\n- Published classified information on that same website.\n- Got called out for accidentally inflating that savings amount by $7.992 billion, and doubled down on their inaccuracy before they fixed it.\n- Fired hundreds of people who work on nuclear security, then scrambled to rehire them, except they had nuked all the work email addresses and personnel files so they didn‚Äôt know how to get in touch.\n- Basically the same deal, except with the US Department of Agriculture employees working to protect the country from a looming bird flu crisis.\n- Rehired a 25-year-old engineer with a stack of racist tweets to his name.\n- Spouted a bunch of nonsense conspiracy theories about who‚Äôs getting Social Security benefits. (OK, that was all Musk.)\nThat‚Äôs just a sampling. It doesn‚Äôt include the damage born of purging thousands of workers across multiple government agencies, the consequences of which will reverberate in both obvious and unexpected ways for a generation‚Äînot to mention the near-term impact that spiking the unemployment rate will have on the US economy. It doesn‚Äôt include the opportunity cost of tossing hundreds of government contracts and programs into a bonfire.\nThis is just the truly dumb stuff, the peek behind the veil of DOGE, the confirmation that all of this destruction is, in fact, as specious and arbitrary as it seems. When in doubt, tear it all down, see what breaks, assume you can repair it‚Äîmaybe with AI? It‚Äôs the federal government; how hard can it be?\nThis is incompetence born of self-confidence. It‚Äôs a familiar Silicon Valley mindset, the reason startups are forever reinventing a bus, or a bodega, or mail. It‚Äôs the implacable certainty that if you‚Äôre smart at one thing you must be smart at all of the things.\nIt doesn‚Äôt work like that. Michael Jordan is the best basketball player of all time; when he turned to baseball in 1994, Jordan hit .202 in 127 games for the AA Birmingham Barons. (For anyone unfamiliar with baseball stats, this is very bad. Embarrassing, honestly.) Elon Musk is the undisputed champion of making money for Elon Musk. As effectively the CEO of the United States of America? Very bad. Embarrassing, honestly.\nJust look at all of those firings. DOGE has targeted so-called probationary employees first, often without regard for their skill or the necessity of their roles. Do you know what a probationary employee is? It‚Äôs people who have been in their position for less than a year, or in some cases less than two years. That means new hires, sure, but also experienced workers who recently transferred departments or got promoted.\nNot only does DOGE not seem to understand this, it has given no indication that it wants to understand. These are the easiest employees to fire, legally speaking, so they‚Äôre gone. It even changed the length of the probationary period‚Äîfrom one year of service to two‚Äîin order to super-size its purge of the National Science Foundation.\nIt takes a certain swashbuckling arrogance to propel a startup to glory. But as we‚Äôve repeatedly said, the United States is not a startup. The federal government exists to do all of the things that are definitionally not profitable, that serve the public good rather than protect investor profits. (The vast majority of startups also fail, something the United States cannot afford to do.)\nAnd if you don‚Äôt believe in the public good? You sprint through the ruination. You metastasize from agency to agency, leveling the maximum allowable destruction under the law. DOGE‚Äôs costly, embarrassing mistakes are a byproduct of reckless nihilism; if artificial intelligence can sell you a pizza, of course it can future-proof the General Services Administration.\nWorse still, none of this will actually help DOGE make a dent in its purported mission. What‚Äôs efficient about firing people you have to scramble to hire back? What are the cost savings of a few thousand federal employees compared to the F-35 program? What are we even doing here, actually?\nThere are two possible explanations for this mess. One is that Musk and DOGE have no interest in the government, or efficiency, but do care deeply about the data they can reap from various agencies and revel in privatization for its own sake. The other is that a bunch of purportedly talented coders have indeed responded to a higher civic calling but are out here batting .202.\nMusk did have a rare moment of self-awareness late last week, during an Oval Office appearance with his 4-year-old son and President Donald Trump. ‚ÄúWe will make mistakes,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut we'll act quickly to correct any mistakes.‚Äù\nSo far he‚Äôs half right.\nThe Chatroom\nAre any of the changes DOGE has made for the better?\nWIRED Reads\n- There Are SpaceX Engineers Already Working Inside the FAA: SpaceX engineers were said to be simply touring the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday. In fact, some were already being onboarded at the agency under a policy designed to increase ‚Äúemployment opportunities for people with disabilities.‚Äù\n- The 50-Year-Old Privacy Law That Could Stop DOGE in Its Track: At least eight ongoing lawsuits related to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency‚Äôs alleged access to sensitive data hinge on the Watergate-inspired Privacy Act of 1974. But it‚Äôs not airtight.\n- Not Even DOGE Employees Know Who‚Äôs Legally Running DOGE: Despite all appearances, the White House insists that Elon Musk is not in charge of DOGE.

    "content_text": "Here‚Äôs a fun tidbit to toss out at your next dinner party: Tubi is home to the biggest content library of all the streamers. That‚Äôs right, the one-time underdog of streaming now claims it has more content than Netflix.\nTubi has over 275,000 titles from every era and genre of film and television. At least, that's what the company says; it‚Äôs nearly impossible to verify given the library‚Äôs size. Offerings span cult classics (Cooley High), ‚Äô90s heist movies (The Thomas Crown Affair), and everything in between‚Äîanime, Westerns, French New Wave, reality TV, popcorn horror. You name it and Tubi (most likely) has it. Yes, even Leprechaun 4: Lost In Space.\nThere‚Äôs a decent chance you‚Äôve heard some of this before. Tubi‚Äôs free, ad-supported streaming service is having a moment. In the last 12 months it has simulcast the Super Bowl, along with Fox Sports, its corporate partner, and inked deals with the WWE‚Äîto air Evolve, a new weekly show of next-gen wrestlers trying to break out of the developmental league‚Äîand The Black List, to help overlooked creators churn out scripts. Tubi is also more popular than it‚Äôs ever been in markets like Mexico, where it is the exclusive provider of the Concacaf Champions Cup.\nBut despite its deep Rolodex of content and dedicated viewership‚Äî97 million monthly active users and counting‚Äîthe platform continues to face poor public perception.\nThere are a seemingly infinite number of things to watch on Tubi‚Äîand a lot of it, by prestige streaming standards, would earn a failing grade. Tubi‚Äôs zero-restrictions approach to licensing has turned the streamer into ‚Äúa bit of a social punching bag,‚Äù says Nicole Parlapiano, the platform‚Äôs chief marketing officer.\nTubi has been called everything from the ‚ÄúCriterion Collection but for really bad movies‚Äù to a platform for ‚ÄúD-tier straight-to-DVD shit movies.‚Äù It has stagy revenge thrillers like Bottle Girls Gone Bad and an undercooked remake of the 1976 horror flick I Spit on Your Grave. ‚ÄúTubi got some of the most toxic low-budget movies I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù @slscolours posted on X recently. ‚ÄúU can literally be [an] actor on there with no experience.‚Äù (Many barbs directed at the company, it‚Äôs worth noting, seem to be shared with love.)\nBut there is a reason‚Äîand a pretty radical one‚Äîwhy many ‚Äúlow-budget‚Äù movies are featured on the streamer. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here to tell you what is good, what is Emmy Award‚Äìwinning,‚Äù Parlapiano says. ‚ÄúListen, we have independent films that have really bad stunts. They‚Äôre campy. We don‚Äôt take ourselves too seriously. We don‚Äôt have that veneer, and we never want to have it.‚Äù\nThe streaming wars were about more than dominance. Maybe more than anything, the battle over the future of TV was about who represented its most idyllic version. Where other streamers are often concerned with appealing to the widest audience possible or reflecting its tastes back to members through the originals it acquires, Tubi decided that was not the route it wanted to take.\n‚ÄúThat was a game that everyone was playing,‚Äù Parlapiano says, ‚Äúand it was a race to the bottom to catch Netflix.‚Äù\nTubi was founded in 2014 by Farhad Massoudi, an engineer with a degree from UC Berkeley, as an ad-tech platform for studios to be able to monetize their content. The goal, at least the way Massoudi first envisioned it, was to build backend infrastructure for studios to have their own streaming partner.\nMassoudi realized that scaling that version of his business, then named AdRise, would be too difficult. So he pivoted to an aggregated white label product via licensing deals. At the time, Netflix was coasting on the success of House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black, breakout originals that set a new benchmark for streamers. Massoudi felt licensing could be Tubi‚Äôs bread and butter. He wanted it to be the company‚Äôs first real pure play as a streaming service in the market, with a specific focus on lower-cost content to keep profits healthy. And for eight years, that was the model.\nBy the end of 2022, as the era of Peak TV came and went, Massoudi was plagued by questions of expansion. What did Tubi stand for? Where could it carve out a unique path forward to compete in a crowded ecosystem that now included both major players‚ÄîApple TV+, Amazon, Hulu‚Äîand dozens of niche streamers like Shudder and Zeus. The streaming wars would soon be over; how would Tubi position itself in the era ahead?\nSimilar to YouTube, Tubi adopted a creator-friendly model. From a content producer standpoint, it was ‚Äúvery accommodating,‚Äù says J. Christopher Hamilton, an assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University who previously worked as entertainment executive at Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery. It was Black viewers, Hamilton says, who introduced Tubi to a wider viewership during its rebrand. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs largely why Tubi has been able to amass a degree of momentum compared to some of its competitors.‚Äù\nAs the company attempted to reset, it realized it could take advantage of the watercooler moments that were happening online. In 2023, several grainy, poorly-shot films found passionate audiences on TikTok and X. The films‚Äîwith mocking titles like Amityville in the Hood and Cocaine Cougar‚Äîwent viral across social media thanks to a cohort of creatives, many of whom were from the Detroit area. All of the projects were self-funded. ‚ÄúTubi isn‚Äôt just a streaming service for fans to enjoy,‚Äù journalist Phil Lewis wrote of the trend, ‚Äúit has become an outlet for independent Black filmmakers to showcase their art.‚Äù\nFox had a similar rise to prominence in the 1990s in terms of its programming. ‚ÄúWhen Fox launched it started out distributing Black-targeted content that was steeped in the community,‚Äù Hamilton adds. Tubi was acquired by Fox in 2020 for $440 million, and by June of 2023, Massoudi had exited the company. ‚ÄúA lot of the success of the network happened on the heels of Black programming and Black audiences. Once they were at a certain level of success, they pivoted to more well-heeled demographics, which was white men. The playbook is very similar now.‚Äù\nToday, Tubi has something that streamers often forsake in the name of big-budget prestige programming: total saturation.\nOne major goal for Tubi this year, Parlapiano says, is to bring in more partners that help the streamer maintain its diverse catalog. The approach is pretty straightforward. ‚ÄúWe focus on specific fandoms and genres,‚Äù Parlapiano says. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt prioritize our own content over what people want to see. You like whatever you like, and it doesn't matter if we like it. We are not telling you what to watch. This idea that everyone should have FOMO around what to watch or where to watch it is exhausting. Monoculture is dead.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs a gamble, but one she believes will pay off handsomely. ‚ÄúWe do want to be a place where all sorts of creatives from different backgrounds can platform their stories and you don't need billions of dollars to do so.‚Äù\nTo bring content to the platform, Tubi works with studios and independent distributors in addition to creating their own original content. The deals are structured as a multi-year licensing agreement or revenue share. As Palarpiano sees it, that makes Tubi the ‚Äúmost accessible player in Hollywood, both from a viewer standpoint and from who we work with.‚Äù\nThat doesn‚Äôt exactly help Tubi‚Äôs image problem, but it does give it an advantage over streamers with more credibility. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre Kmart. They have some of everything,‚Äù Hamilton says. ‚ÄúBut what will keep them well situated in the space is that there is zero barrier for entry. There is no requirement to sign up for anything. It‚Äôs like television from back in the day. You turn it on and you watch. In terms of a business model, that makes them incredibly competitive.‚Äù\nIs the goal to eventually dethrone Netflix? I ask Parlapiano.\nIt‚Äôs about respect, she says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not looking to dethrone anyone. We want to be considered within the same competitive set and be taken seriously. There is a stigma around free streaming apps that I think is quite unfair‚Äîthat we are not as good.‚Äù But that‚Äôs changing. At its peak, 15.5 million viewers were watching the Super Bowl on Tubi. ‚ÄúI think that stigma is fucking gone now.‚Äù",

The goal, at least the way Massoudi first envisioned it, was to build backend infrastructure for studios to have their own streaming partner.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Massoudi realized that scaling that version of his business, then named AdRise, would be too difficult. So he pivoted to an aggregated white label product via licensing deals. At the time, Netflix was coasting on the success of <em>House of Cards</em> and <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>, breakout originals that set a new benchmark for streamers. Massoudi felt licensing could be Tubi‚Äôs bread and butter. He wanted it to be the company‚Äôs first real pure play as a streaming service in the market, with a specific focus on lower-cost content to keep profits healthy. And for eight years, that was the model.</p><p class=\"paywall\">By the end of 2022, as the era of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/streaming-too-big/\">Peak TV came and went</a>, Massoudi was plagued by questions of expansion.

    "content_text": "Breeze Liu‚Äôs online nightmare started with a phone call. In April 2020, a college classmate rang Liu, then 24 years old, to tell her an explicit video of her was on PornHub under the title ‚ÄúKorean teen.‚Äù Liu alleges it had been filmed without her permission when she was 17 and uploaded without her consent.\nOver time, the video mushroomed and multiplied: it was saved, posted on other porn websites and, Liu claims, used to create intimate deepfake videos that spread across the web. The impact on Liu was profound. ‚ÄúI honestly had to struggle with suicidal thoughts, and I almost killed myself,‚Äù she says.\nWiping around 400 nonconsensual images and videos from the web would require a multiyear, intercontinental effort. During this time, Liu went from working as a venture capitalist to starting her own company to help fight digital abuse. But when dealing with her own content, the entrepreneur faced a wall of silence and continual delays from one of the internet‚Äôs biggest gatekeepers: Microsoft.\nAs images and videos are published on websites like PornHub, they‚Äôre often hosted on cloud infrastructure. A series of emails related to Liu‚Äôs case reviewed by WIRED, plus interviews with a French victims‚Äô aid organization and other advocates working with her, show how Microsoft, despite repeated pleas, did not remove about 150 explicit images of Liu stored on its Azure cloud services. While other companies took down hundreds of images, Liu and a colleague say Microsoft only took action after the two confronted a senior member of the tech giant‚Äôs safety team at a content moderation conference.\nThe drawn-out process, which prolonged the emotional toll on Liu, provides a detailed illustration of the difficulties victims and survivors of intimate image abuse experience in trying to erase the content from the web. Liu‚Äôs ordeal also highlights the void some victims fall into when their age in the imagery is disputed or hard to discern, an overlooked problem that may become more pressing as nudify apps spread in high schools.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost impossible for ordinary people to navigate the complex system and do damage control,‚Äù Liu says. While she has shared parts of her struggle before, many of the details in this story and the resolution of Microsoft‚Äôs prolonged failure to remove the intimate images have not been previously reported. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre facing an extremely broken system, and this is a global issue,‚Äù Liu says. ‚ÄúThis is a huge problem.‚Äù\nCourtney Gregoire, Microsoft‚Äôs chief digital safety officer, says the company has learned from miscommunications in Liu‚Äôs case and doesn‚Äôt want anyone to go through the agonizing experience she did. ‚ÄúThis content is a priority area where we endeavor to be actioning within 12 hours,‚Äù Gregoire says. For Liu, the grueling process took eight months.\nAfter being alerted to the first nonconsensual video of her online in April 2020, Liu says, it took her a whole day to calm down. On May 14 of that year, she contacted the Berkeley Police Department, where she lived in California at the time.\nThe state considers it a misdemeanor crime to share real or spoofed intimate images of someone without their consent while knowing it would cause them distress. Detectives obtained search warrants for some websites but couldn‚Äôt identify the people responsible for uploading the content ‚Äúbased on the limited information retained by the internet sites and the overseas nature of the accounts involved,‚Äù department spokesperson Byron White says. Liu says she had a suspicion of who was responsible for the uploads, but the detectives weren‚Äôt sure how to prove it.\nLiu contacted the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a US-based nonprofit that helps to tackle abusive content. While the organization found another webpage with violative content of her, the entrepreneur says it couldn‚Äôt aid her with takedown requests because she appeared potentially under the age of 18 in the images. The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative declined to comment about Liu but confirmed that it is legally barred from reviewing sexual imagery of minors.\nBy this point, it had been months since Liu first learned of the images and videos, and she needed a break. The original video hadn‚Äôt been quickly removed, and Liu suspected it had already spread far and wide. She felt powerless. She decided to let the case go, citing the stress of the pandemic, her frantic work schedule in venture capital, and the toll on her health. Embarrassed and terrified, the only confidant she told her story to was her cat.\n‚ÄúI always had this gut feeling that there‚Äôs more, but I was not mentally stable enough to handle any more brutal truths,‚Äù Liu says, adding that she did not feel comfortable searching for them herself. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to see that of yourself.‚Äù That changed after Liu left her VC job in 2022 and decided to fully pursue her own startup, Alecto AI, which aims to develop face-recognition tools to help people find and remove nonconsensual images that have been shared on digital platforms.\nIt took about three years before Liu was ready to revisit efforts to get the explicit content of her taken down. Toward the end of 2023, she enlisted the help of her Alecto AI cofounder, Andrea Powell, a longtime trafficking and abuse victims‚Äô advocate. That October, they sought out the help of a researcher at a victim helpline funded by the UK government. The researcher‚Äôs manual and automated image searching discovered 832 links appearing to show Liu in intimate states. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt even look at the file, because that was just too much,‚Äù Liu says. She dialed up her therapist while a friend downloaded the spreadsheet of URLs for her. ‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt even clicking into the content; she was just looking at the name of the URLs and she started crying,‚Äù Liu says.\nPowell says the links contained ‚Äúviolent Asian-centric‚Äù language. But the UK-funded helpline can‚Äôt help victims abroad with takedowns, leaving Liu stranded with the spreadsheet. She thought about using StopNCII, a popular tool that uses matching algorithms to find abusive images, but felt it wasn‚Äôt a good fit. She feared it might not be able to spot potential deepfakes.\nLiu then contacted the FBI, which preserved some of the links as evidence but in her view did not demonstrate further progress toward arresting the original uploader. The agency declined WIRED‚Äôs request for comment.\nAt one point, Liu turned to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, or NCMEC, a nonprofit established by the US Congress to work with child sexual abuse imagery, to see if it could help. But the nonprofit could not engage, Liu says. Even though Liu looked young in the content, she could not prove she was under 18 at the time, a prerequisite for NCMEC to pursue takedowns.\nLauren Coffren, NCMEC‚Äôs executive director, says it relies on partner law enforcement agencies to assess the age of victims. Age-borderline cases are rare, Coffren says, but ‚Äúthat stinks for a survivor‚Äù who should qualify for the organization‚Äôs help. ‚ÄúIt speaks to just how difficult it is for survivors to be able to navigate this.‚Äù\nLiu felt stuck between groups that seemingly couldn‚Äôt pursue takedowns for her. And she was tired of being judged. ‚ÄúWhat difference would it make if I was 17 or just two days over 18?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe damage for me is the same. It‚Äôs beyond frustrating.‚Äù\nThat‚Äôs when Powell, at the Paris Peace Forum, pleaded to a French victims‚Äô aid organization, Point de Contact, which assists people in reporting illegal content. ‚ÄúI was sort of threatening that I just fly Breeze to France and make the case she‚Äôs French,‚Äù Powell says. Ultimately, on November 13, 2023, Point de Contact agreed to step up where other organizations had not. In the following days, emails show, the hotline analyzed the URLs and by the middle of December had started to send legal takedown demands to hosting providers. Liu was overcome‚Äîprogress at last. ‚ÄúI'm literally shaking as I'm typing this,‚Äù Liu wrote in an email as the work began.\nEtienne Dirani, operations manager at Point de Contact, says it found 395 nonconsensual images in the links Liu provided. The majority of the remaining 437 had already been deleted or made inaccessible. Others did not clearly identify Liu, or did not depict her intimately. Dirani says ‚Äútens‚Äù of unique images were published across multiple websites and that Point de Contact‚Äôs investigation at the time didn‚Äôt find any content ‚Äúlikely‚Äù generated by AI.\nSome companies and hosting providers moved quickly; by the first week of January 2024, 155 URLs were dead. Microsoft, according to emails from Point de Contact to Liu, requested additional identifying information, such as her full name and social media handles, so the company could verify the content was associated with her. Liu provided these details, including a copy of her passport, but nothing happened.\nMore than a month later, a few dozen additional pieces of content had been removed. Of the 202 that remained online, 142 were hosted on Microsoft‚Äôs Azure services. A Point de Contact investigator emailed Liu and alleged, ‚ÄúMicrosoft's abuse team did not answer our notification emails‚Äù and said the team was trying some of its individual contacts at the company. Around that time, a frustrated Liu mentioned Microsoft‚Äôs slow response in an interview with The Street. An unnamed Microsoft spokesperson told the news outlet that the company was investigating and noted that any potential violations of its acceptable use policy are taken seriously. Yet again, no action followed.\n‚ÄúThe main issue we had was the lack of response from Microsoft,‚Äù Dirani says. He alleges that Microsoft‚Äôs abuse team believed that it needed more information, but he says the company never communicated what that information was. Even a higher-up contact wouldn‚Äôt give a straight answer on what additional details could trigger a takedown. Point de Contact tried to ‚Äúpush‚Äù Microsoft more, including opening a new case, according to Dirani. ‚ÄúWe were sending reminders of all the URLs that were still online,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut unfortunately, even the new reports we sent were not responded to.‚Äù\nAs months went by, Liu could do little but wonder how many people each day were encountering the violative imagery of her. She was terrified about her career being derailed and was generally disheartened. Powell says she was in touch with Microsoft‚Äôs director of public policy for digital safety, Liz Thomas, at the time, but she was told it was difficult to verify the content showed Liu.\nHowever, in late July last year, Powell and Liu concocted a plan to speak with Thomas at a San Francisco hotel hosting TrustCon, a conference for people working on online trust and safety issues. They hadn‚Äôt registered for the event, but Powell located Thomas at the hotel‚Äôs public bar with a group of colleagues. Once the colleagues left, Powell approached Thomas and urged for action, pointing toward Liu as she made her case. Seeing Liu in the same room made an impact.\nWithin days of the event, a Microsoft staffer emailed Powell that the case had been escalated, and the 142 URLs with Liu‚Äôs image started disappearing. ‚ÄúI don't ideally want to be chasing trust and safety people up and down the halls at TrustCon to deal with a case,‚Äù Powell says. ‚ÄúBut it was what had to be done.‚Äù\nAt the start of last August, Point de Contact told WIRED that only two images on four different Microsoft servers remained. ‚ÄúWe deeply regret that this issue took almost 10 months of communication between the victim, Microsoft and us as an NGO to be resolved,‚Äù the NGO said in an email at the time.\nMicrosoft digital safety chief Gregoire says Liu‚Äôs situation has spurred her team to try to improve reporting processes and relationships with victim aid groups. Point de Contact initially flagged links over which the company didn‚Äôt have control, according to Gregoire. She declined to elaborate on the circumstances. Dirani says this explanation was never communicated to him, and it remains unclear why the links were not ‚Äúactionable.‚Äù\nOnly after Powell cornered Thomas over Liu‚Äôs case did Microsoft obtain the URLs upon which it could act. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thankful, to be perfectly honest, to the spontaneous connection at TrustCon,‚Äù Gregoire says. But it shouldn‚Äôt be needed again: Point de Contact now has a more direct way to stay in touch, she says.\nOther victim aid groups say their relationships with tech giants remain challenging. Last year, a WIRED investigation revealed that executives at Google rejected numerous ideas raised by staff and outside advocates that aimed to proactively counter access to problematic imagery in search results. Some survivors have found that the fastest way to get content removed is by filing copyright claims, a tactic those working in the online safety industry say is inadequate.\nThe lack of consistency in policies and processes among tech companies contributes to delays in securing takedowns, according to Emma Pickering, the head of technology facilitated abuse at Refuge, the UK‚Äôs largest domestic abuse organization. ‚ÄúThey all just respond however they choose to‚Äîand the response usually is incredibly poor,‚Äù she says. (Google introduced new policies in July 2024 to accelerate removals.)\nPickering claims Microsoft, in particular, has been difficult. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve recently been told if I want to engage with them, we need to provide evidence that we use their platform and we promote them,‚Äù she says, adding Refuge is trying to engage with as many tech platforms as possible.\nMicrosoft‚Äôs Gregoire says she will look into these concerns and is open to dialogue. The company hopes to stem the need for takedowns, in part, by scaring off perpetrators. This past December, Microsoft sued a group of 10 unknown individuals who allegedly circumvented safeguards on Azure and used an AI tool to generate offensive images, including some Gregoire described as sexually harmful. ‚ÄúWe don't want our services to be abused to cause harm,‚Äù she says.\nFor Liu, the challenges haven‚Äôt ended. Videos and images depicting her naked remain available on at least one self-styled ‚Äúfree porn‚Äù website, according to links reviewed by WIRED. She also has had to pour her savings into developing Alecto AI because investor support has been lackluster. Some investors allegedly told her not to use her own experience in her pitch. Liu says that when she pitched one male-female pair who were considering investing, they burst into laughter at the idea of building a business around the use of AI to detect online image abuse. Even responding that she had almost killed herself after being victimized did little to sway them, Liu says.\nIn December 2024, more than four and a half years since her nightmare began, Liu found a glimmer of hope. A proposal she has advocated for in the US Congress to require websites to remove unwanted explicit images within 48 hours nearly ended up on then-President Joe Biden‚Äôs desk. It was ultimately shelved, but real progress had never felt so close. Liu and a bipartisan group of over 20 lawmakers haven‚Äôt given up; in January, they reintroduced the proposal, which threatens potential penalties of up to $50,000 per violation. Despite objections from rights groups worried about over-censorship, the bill passed the Senate last week. Even Microsoft has gotten behind it.\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for free, 24-hour support from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Subscription video service HBO Max not only has The Sopranos, but other content from the best entertainment libraries, including: Warner Bros., Discovery Channel, CNN, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Animal Planet, and other brands.\nWe at WIRED also watch a lot of content‚Äîobviously, because we are always testing TVs, soundbars, and streaming devices‚Äîand regularly round up our newest favorites from HBO Max so that you‚Äôll know what to watch once you nab an HBO Max promo code. Whether you‚Äôre wanting to watch an HBO original series like Succession or a smash hit movie like Barbie, HBO Max has the content you‚Äôre looking for, and WIRED has the perfect promo codes to help you save on these sometimes-pricey subscription plans.\n50% Off HBO Max Promo Code for Students\nStudents rejoice, you don‚Äôt have to try to mooch off your friends‚Äô parents' HBO Max subscriptions anymore when you want to rewatch Euphoria for the 15th time (...not speaking from personal experience or anything). HBO Max is offering a Student Discount, where you can save and get 50% off subscriptions with a promo code. This means the price is only $5 a month. This discounted plan is eligible for The HBO Max Basic With Ads monthly plan, so you‚Äôll get unlimited access to all of HBO, hit series, movies, news, sports, and more on up to two devices at once.\nSave 35% by Bundling HBO Max, Disney+ and Hulu\nThis deal is honestly one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen, and I‚Äôve been thinking of switching as well, because with this Magic Bundle, you can get HBO Max, Disney+, and Hulu for just $17 a month. (which is crazy because I pay that much alone for my Hulu! Again, I‚Äôm convincing myself while writing this that I should switch to this plan.) This crazy good deal is for those three streaming services with ads, but you‚Äôll be saving 35% on the original price. If you‚Äôre impatient like me, you can get the same deal without ads for $30 a month, which is definitely higher than with ads but you‚Äôre still saving almost $19 a month with this Evergreen deal.\nHBO Max Deals: Save up to $41\nLike other streaming services, HBO Max has different tiers at different prices for streaming, so you can choose which one fits you (or your ‚Äúhousehold;‚Äù wink) best. Basic with ads allows you to stream on two devices at once in full HD for $10 a month. Standard is midrange, where you get everything from the previous basic plus 30 available downloads so you can watch on the go, for $17 a month. If you are impatient and a movie/TV buff, you might want to choose the premium, where you can stream on four devices at once, have 4k Ultra HD video quality, Dolby Atmos immersive audio, and 100 downloads to watch on the go for $21 a month.\nStream Sports Games for Free With Your HBO Max Subscription\nAs an added bonus, you can also stream live sports through the B/R Sports add-on at no extra cost. This includes super popular events from the NBA, NHL, March Madness, MLB, U.S. Soccer, Bellator, and premier cycling events. Act soon though, because after the promo period, the add-on will be available for $10 a month.\nWatch Your Favorite Shows on HBO Max for Free\nBecause HBO knows how tempting (and sexy) teasing can be, folks can sample episodes of new and fan-favorite original steamy series, like Euphoria, Industry, or The Idol for free without a subscription. When you inevitably get hooked (too soon after the Euphoria reference?) on that sweet, sweet content, you‚Äôll need an HBO Max subscription to stream the full library. To continue to tease, you can stream nearly endless options, like House of the Dragon from the wildly popular Game of Thrones series, Dune, and my personal faves: The Last of Us, The Penguin, and Hacks, right now.

He has been tracked at the General Services Administration (GSA), the Office of Personnel Management, the State Department, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. At State‚Äôs Bureau of Diplomatic Technology, he potentially had access to systems containing sensitive information about diplomats and many sources around the world who provide the US government with intelligence and expertise.\nAs the journalist Marisa Kabas was first to report, he has now moved to CISA, a division of DHS. He is listed in the staff directory as a senior adviser.\nA second DOGE worker, Schutt, has also joined Coristine at CISA. Schutt has reportedly also been at the GSA. Prior to his work with DOGE, he worked on the launch of WinRed, a fundraising platform for Republicans that helped the party raise $1.8 billion during the 2024 election campaigns.\nIt‚Äôs not clear what level of access Coristine might have to data and networks at CISA, but the agency, which is responsible for the defense of civilian federal government networks and works closely with critical infrastructure owners around the country, stores a lot of sensitive and critical security information on its networks. This includes information about software vulnerabilities, breaches, and network risk assessments conducted for local and state election offices. Since 2018, CISA has helped state and local election offices around the country assess vulnerabilities in their networks and help secure them. CISA also works with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency to notify victims of breaches and process information about software vulnerabilities before the information becomes public.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening?

Coristine has not been associated with the Snowflake breaches, but as WIRED has reported, an account that has been associated with him did appear to suggest the owner of the account was seeking help to conduct a distributed denial-of-service attack‚Äîa criminal technique that involves launching extensive traffic at a domain to disable it and prevent legitimate traffic from reaching it.

    "content_text": "The director of data science and engineering for the United States Digital Service‚Äîwhich Elon Musk rebranded as the US DOGE Service‚Äîhas resigned from her position.\nAnne Marshall, the now former director, spent more than a decade as an engineer at Amazon before joining USDS in September 2023. In December, she was promoted to director of data science and engineering, but only served around two months in the role before resigning on Wednesday.\n‚ÄúToday I resigned from the US Digital Service. It has been the greatest privilege of my life to be able to do this work, with this team of amazing people,‚Äù Marshall wrote on LinkedIn on Wednesday evening. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, DOGE chose to fire one third of them last week. These cuts were shortsighted, ill-informed, and indiscriminate. The government and the American people will be worse off from the loss of these people.‚Äù\nYesterday, legacy USDS employees met with two representatives from DOGE to discuss the organization‚Äôs future, following the Friday evening firings of around 50 product managers, designers, and others at USDS. Amy Gleason, a former Trump administration USDS official, and Kendall Lindemann, formerly of McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm, explained to the remaining staff members that DOGE would become increasingly more hands-on within the organization over the coming weeks and months, USDS sources say.\nGleason and Lindemann, who did not provide their roles at DOGE, said that anyone not already terminated would be considered part of the DOGE team going forward and that the two previously separated teams would merge. The consolidation of the two different groups, the new DOGE members and the legacy USDS staff, is a marked difference compared to the rest of the last month at the organization: Earlier this month, USDS workers told WIRED that DOGE had built a ‚Äúfirewall‚Äù separating the two groups. Up until Tuesday, the only DOGE representative to join a broader legacy USDS team meeting was Stephanie M. Holmes, who identified herself as the group‚Äôs new HR person.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all DOGE going forward,‚Äù one USDS source tells WIRED.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening?

Learn more.\nYesterday, the cheapest iPhone cost $429 if you wanted to buy directly from Apple. Today? It's $599. The new iPhone 16e replaced the iPhone SE, giving the aging device a much-needed cosmetic upgrade and power boost, but it comes at a cost. The overhaul is so big that the iPhone 16e is essentially a new class of device in Apple's smartphone lineup, hence the name change. (Apple didn't say what the ‚Äúe‚Äù stands for.)\nApple also took this opportunity to cut the $599 iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus from its roster, though it has kept the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, which cost more than the iPhone 16e. All of this effectively means Apple no longer sells an iPhone for less than $500. Does it matter? It might not make much of a difference in the United States, where most people purchase phones subsidized through carriers, and globally, there's a ‚Äúpremiumization‚Äù trend where consumers are opting for higher-end phones. First, let's dig into the details.\nThe iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 15\nThese are Apple‚Äôs two cheapest iPhones right now. The iPhone 16e has the more powerful A18 processor with access to Apple Intelligence, and the new Apple-designed C1 modem is supposedly so efficient that it enables better battery life than even the iPhone 16 despite the same 6.1-inch screen size. It also includes the same easy-to-replace battery mechanism.\nBut there are a few reasons to pay a bit more for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15. The screens are brighter, portrait photos might look better, and there's a spare ultrawide camera lens. Also, some camera features are available on the 15 series that aren't on the 16e, such as Cinematic and Action mode.\nThe iPhone 15 series also features Qi2/MagSafe wireless charging, so you can access a wealth of MagSafe accessories, whereas the iPhone 16e is stuck on the slower and less energy-efficient Qi wireless charging standard. You'll have to make do with MagSafe cases that replicate the functionality, though it doesn't improve energy efficiency or charging speed. (Weirdly, maybe Apple should have followed Samsung's ‚ÄúQi2 Ready‚Äù approach?)\n|Specs\n|iPhone 16e (2025)\n|iPhone 15 (2023)\n|Display:\n|6.1 inches, OLED, 60 Hz, 1,200 nits peak brightness (HDR)\n|6.1 inches, OLED, 60 Hz, 2,000 nits peak brightness outdoors\n|Build:\n|Aluminum and Ceramic Shield\n|Aluminum and Ceramic Shield\n|Processor:\n|Apple A18\n|Apple A16\n|Storage:\n|128, 256, and 512 GB\n|128, 256, and 512 GB\n|Cameras:\n|48-megapixel main camera, 12-MP selfie camera\n|48-megapixel main camera, 12-MP ultrawide, 12-MP selfie camera\n|Battery:\n|26 hours of video playback, 21 hours of streamed video playback\n|20 hours of video playback, 16 hours of streamed video playback\n|Extras:\n|Qi wireless charging, Face ID, USB-C, Apple Intelligence, IP68\n|Qi2/MagSafe wireless charging, Face ID, USB-C, Dynamic Island, Ultra Wideband (2nd Gen), IP68\n|Colors:\n|Black, White\n|Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, Black\n|Price:\n|$599\n|$699\nThen there's the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 15, which is baked into the floating selfie camera bar. It makes use of the camera cutout by letting you access live app activities, like seeing how far away an Uber is or quickly hopping back into the Maps app. This is unavailable on the iPhone 16e, which has a static notch like the original iPhone X.\nFinally, the iPhone 15 also has the second-gen ultra-wideband (UWB) chip, whereas the iPhone 16e doesn't feature it at all‚Äîthis is what enables you to precisely track the location of nearby AirTags. You can still track AirTags with the iPhone 16e, but the iPhone can't point out exactly where it is in your vicinity.\nBy and large, those are most of the differences between the phones. It's worth pointing out that the iPhone 16e is launching in fewer countries than other models‚Äî59 countries to be exact. Apple didn't share why, but it may have something to do with the new C1 modem, as carriers often need to certify them for use.\nThe pro move? Stick to a used iPhone 15 Pro, which you can find for roughly $600 these days on sites like Swappa in Good condition, even less if you buy a carrier version. It includes Apple Intelligence if you really want it, plus you get many more extra features.\nNo More ‚ÄòCheap‚Äô iPhone?\nThe lack of a sub-$500 iPhone seems like a gaping hole in Apple's smartphone strategy, but Maurice Klaehne, a senior research analyst at Counterpoint Research, doesn't think it will affect consumers much, particularly in the US.\nHe says roughly 10 percent of iPhone sales in America come from Apple Stores, meaning the vast majority of the population purchases subsidized devices from carriers. While Apple may not directly sell older iPhones like the now-gone iPhone 14, these carriers still carry these devices that consumers can purchase for cheaper, not to mention the enticing promotions for newer devices. (Of course, these subsidized phones have caveats in that they're locked to a network. That's why we recommend unlocked phones as it doesn't force you into a contract and allow you to freely switch carriers.)\nGlobally, there's far more choice in the sub-$500 smartphone category than there is in the US, especially from Chinese companies. However, Klaehne says there's a premiumization trend, where consumers are opting to shell out for higher-end devices, whether it's as a status symbol‚ÄîApple is an aspirational brand after all‚Äîor for more premium features. This is compounded by an apparent desire for smartphones with generative AI capabilities‚Äîa Counterpoint survey found that 59 percent of respondents were open to upgrading to a GenAI phone in 2025‚Äîand that number is even higher in the US with 67 percent.\n‚ÄúThere's more of an interest now for these devices especially as we're getting away from generation one GenAI to AI agents that do more specific tasks for you and are able to be more integrated into your device,‚Äù he says.\nIt all comes back to artificial intelligence. There's a reason why Apple did not choose to use the iPhone SE branding but include ‚Äú16‚Äù in the name of the iPhone 16e. Apple Intelligence was heavily tied to the launch of the iPhone 16, and naturally, people will expect those capabilities with the iPhone 16e.\nWhile Apple Intelligence is free at the moment, Klaehne thinks it opens up a future where it could add to Apple's Services revenue stream‚ÄîGoogle already offers a subscription tier for phones to access a more powerful model of its AI assistant (along with other perks), and an offering like that seems ripe for Apple and its Apple One plans. Getting capable AI-ready devices into people's hands now means a larger pool to pull subscription revenue from in the future.\nBut in the end, if you walk into an Apple Store hoping for a cheap, unlocked iPhone, you're out of luck. Instead, Apple will try to sway you into the iPhone 16e‚Äîit's $200 cheaper than the iPhone 16 after all. What a bargain.",

    "content_text": "Microsoft is wading deeper into generative artificial intelligence for gaming with Muse, a new AI model announced today. The model, which was trained on Ninja Theory‚Äôs multiplayer game Bleeding Edge, can help Xbox game developers build parts of games, Microsoft says. Muse can understand the physics and 3D environment inside a game and generate visuals and reactions to players‚Äô movements.\nAmong the various use cases for Muse that Microsoft outlines in its announcement, perhaps the most intriguing involves game preservation. The company says Muse AI can study games from its vast back catalog of classic titles and optimize them for modern hardware.\nFatima Kardar, Microsoft‚Äôs corporate vice president for Gaming AI wrote in the company‚Äôs press release: ‚ÄúTo imagine that beloved games lost to time and hardware advancement could one day be played on any screen with Xbox is an exciting possibility for us.‚Äù\nThe company says it will continue to explore generative AI, including how to help game teams prototype their projects. In its announcement, Microsoft says the Xbox team interviewed 27 game creators globally ‚Äúto make sure the research was shaped by the people who would use it.‚Äù\nThe response from developers and the larger community online, however, has been swift, with Muse being poorly received. As longtime game developer and founder of the development studio The Outsiders, David Goldfarb said in response to the news: ‚ÄúFuck this shit.‚Äù\nWhile executives continue to grow more interested in generative AI, the technology is becoming less popular with the people who actually make games. In a direct message, Goldfarb says he doesn‚Äôt believe generative AI is good for video games, ‚Äúbecause the people who are promoting it are doing it to reduce capital expenditure and whether they intend to do it or not, are effectively disenfranchising and devaluing millions of collective years of aesthetic effort by game devs and artists.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe primary issue is that we are losing craft,‚Äù Goldfarb says. ‚ÄúWhen we rely on this stuff we are implicitly empowering a class of people who own these tools and don‚Äôt give a fuck about how they reshape our lives.‚Äù\nA WIRED investigation found that AI is pushing human workers out of the work of creating video games at the same time the games industry is undergoing massive constriction. Thousands of developers have been laid off over the past few years, and that trend is continuing in 2025. While some developers believe AI cannot replace creativity in games, others are still concerned about their job security in an industry that is spinning up new tools that obviate the need for their skills.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the classic issue of Xbox bleeding talent but also so heavily invested in GenAI that they can‚Äôt see the forest for the trees,‚Äù said a AAA developer who asked to remain anonymous because they are not allowed to talk publicly about Muse. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt see that nobody will want this. They don‚Äôt CARE that nobody will want this ‚Ä¶ internal discussions about these sorts of things are quiet because EVERYONE fears being against this and losing their jobs due to the tumultuous time in our industry.‚Äù\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former game developer who wants to talk about work conditions, AI, or anything else related to game development? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at meganfarokhmanesh.76.\nAnother developer who also asked to remain anonymous because they fear professional repercussions from speaking out against Muse seconded this sentiment. ‚ÄúIt is gross that I feel I have to be anonymous because with the state of the game industry I also still need to beg them for money for a game pass deal, and attaching my name would reduce my chances,‚Äù they say.\n‚ÄúIt seems to me that the real target of this model is not game developers but shareholders, to show that Microsoft is all in on AI, which has yet to deliver a product that anyone wants,\" the developer says.\nMicrosoft says it‚Äôs already using Muse to create a ‚Äúreal-time playable AI model‚Äù that‚Äôs been trained on first-party games. And generative AI may have some use in certain aspects of game development. The prototyping stage, when a developer creates iterative, bare-bones versions of their game in order to work through their ideas and craft a final vision, is one area where AI proponents‚Äîincluding Microsoft‚Äîargue computer-generated playable models will prove helpful.\nMarc Burrage, development director at Creative Assembly says that even so, computers can‚Äôt draw the same knowledge from the process that humans can. ‚ÄúPrototyping is as much about the journey as the result, and you need to have been on it to get all those learnings,‚Äù Burrage says. ‚ÄúFast prototyping is a valuable skill you can‚Äôt just shortcut and think you‚Äôll still be as prepared afterwards.‚Äù\nIn the Muse announcement, Kardar writes: ‚ÄúWe believe it‚Äôs important to shape how these new generative AI breakthroughs can support our industry and game creation community in a collaborative and responsible way.‚Äù When it comes to convincing developers, Microsoft still has work to do.",

    "content_text": "Engineers who work for Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX have been brought on as senior advisers to the acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), sources tell WIRED.\nOn Sunday, Sean Duffy, secretary of the Department of Transportation, which oversees the FAA, announced in a post on X that SpaceX engineers would be visiting the Air Traffic Control System Command Center in Virginia to take what he positioned as a tour. ‚ÄúThe safety of air travel is a nonpartisan matter,‚Äù Musk replied. ‚ÄúSpaceX engineers will help make air travel safer.‚Äù\nBy the time these posts were made, though, according to sources who were granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, SpaceX engineers were already being onboarded at the agency under Schedule A, a special authority that allows government managers to ‚Äúhire persons with disabilities without requiring them to compete for the job,‚Äù according to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\nThese new hires come after the terminations of hundreds of FAA probationary employees, and the most deadly month of US aviation disasters in more than a decade.\nAccording to a source with knowledge of the situation, none of the SpaceX engineers were fully vetted by their start date. Unlike the very young technologists associated with Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) who have been given access to critical systems at agencies ranging from OPM and the Treasury Department to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in recent weeks, though, the engineers identified by WIRED‚ÄîTed Malaska, Thomas Kiernan, Sam Smeal, and Brady Glantz‚Äîdo appear to have experience relevant to the FAA.\nMalaska is currently, according to his LinkedIn profile, a senior director of application software at SpaceX, where he started working in May 2021. Formerly the senior director of data engineering at Capitol One and a senior architect at FINRA, he graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County in 2000 and cowrote a 2015 book on Hadoop application architectures.\nKiernan is currently a lead software engineer at SpaceX, according to his LinkedIn page. Before joining SpaceX in May 2020, he worked at Wayfair and is a 2017 Dartmouth graduate.\nSmeal is a software engineer who has worked at SpaceX since September 2021, according to his LinkedIn. He graduated from Saint Vincent College in 2018.\nGlantz is a software engineer who has worked at SpaceX since May 2024 and worked as an engineering analyst at Goldman Sachs from 2019 to 2021, according to his LinkedIn, and graduated from the University of Michigan in 2019.\nMalaska, Kiernan, Smeal, and Glantz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The FAA also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at velliott88.18 and aarianm.30.\nIn his post on X, Duffy wrote, \"Because I know the media (and Hillary Clinton) will claim Elon‚Äôs team is getting special access, let me make clear that the @FAANews regularly gives tours of the command center to both media and companies.‚Äù\nBut on Wednesday, FAA acting administrator Chris Rocheleau wrote in an email to FAA staff, viewed by WIRED, that DOGE and the teams of special government employees deployed in federal agencies were ‚Äútop-of-mind,‚Äù before noting that the agency had \"recently welcomed‚Äù a team of special government employees who had already toured some FAA facilities. ‚ÄúWe are asking for their help to engineer solutions while we keep the airspace open and safe,‚Äù he wrote, adding that the new employees had already visited the FAA Command Center and Potomac TRACON, a facility that controls the airspace around and provides air traffic control services to airports in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia areas.\nIn a Department of Transportation all-hands meeting late last week, Duffy responded to a question about DOGE's role in national airspace matters, and without explicitly mentioning the new employees, suggested help was needed on reforming Notice to Air Mission (NOTAM) alerts, a critical system that distributes real-time data and warnings to pilots but which has had significant outages, one as recently as this month. ‚ÄúIf I can get ideas from really smart engineers on how we can fix it, I‚Äôm going to take those ideas,‚Äù he said, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by WIRED. ‚ÄúGreat engineers‚Äù might also work on airspace issues, he said.\nSpaceX functioned as the pre-inauguration staging ground for the DOGE team, according to reporting from The New York Times and sources who spoke to WIRED. In the months between November 5 and January 20, members of DOGE including Steve Davis (president of Musk‚Äôs Boring Company) and the young engineer Luke Farritor were operating out of the company‚Äôs DC office, according to a source with knowledge.\nThe company did not respond to questions about whether these employees will retain their salaries and positions at the company during their time with DOGE. Many of the so-called department‚Äôs operatives have joined as ‚Äúspecial government employees,‚Äù who are limited to working 130 days in a year. Last week WIRED reported that Tom Krause, a DOGE operative at the Treasury Department, would continue to maintain his position as CEO of the Cloud Software Group while also performing the duties of fiscal assistant secretary. Other members of Musk‚Äôs companies, including xAI and Tesla, have also taken on positions with DOGE.\nLate last week, the Trump administration laid off 400 FAA workers, according to Duffy. One union that represents some of these workers, the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, says these included probationary employees who worked on aviation safety and maintenance. Air traffic controllers were not affected by the layoffs, Duffy said in an X post.\nJust two weeks before that, the US suffered its most deadly aviation incident in more than a decade, when 67 people died after an Army helicopter collided with a passenger jet in Washington, DC. Though initial findings suggest complex equipment and communications issues possibly played roles in the disaster, President Trump was quick to blame ‚ÄúDEI,‚Äù railing against a decade-old program that helps the FAA identify talent among populations with disabilities. People with disabilities hired into the FAA and other federal agencies are often accepted under the Schedule A authority‚Äîexactly the route these new engineers have taken into the agency.\nThe FAA has frequently tangled with Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, as the rocket company and others fight to operate their own interests in crowded American airspace. In January, the FAA temporarily grounded SpaceX‚Äôs program after one of its Starship rockets broke apart midflight, reportedly damaging public property on Turks and Caicos in the Caribbean. The FAA diverted dozens of commercial airline flights following the explosion and announced an investigation into the incident, which is ongoing and being led by SpaceX. Musk, however, characterized the failure as ‚Äúbarely a bump in the road‚Äù and did not seem to indicate that the investigation would slow SpaceX‚Äôs launch cadence. Last year, the company indicated it was aiming for 25 launches of the Starship in 2025.\nFAA spokesperson Steven Kulm told WIRED that ‚Äúthe FAA is overseeing the SpaceX-led mishap investigation.‚Äù The FAA did not respond to further questions about whether the presence of SpaceX engineers at the agency would constitute a conflict of interest.\nIn September, the FAA proposed $633,000 in fines following two 2023 incidents in which SpaceX allegedly did not follow its license requirements, violating regulations. Responding to an X user posting about the penalties, Musk wrote, ‚ÄúThe fundamental problem is that humanity will forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA!‚Äù Shortly afterward, Musk called for FAA head Mike Whitaker to resign.\nIn January, more than three years before his term was due to end, Whitaker did resign.\n‚ÄúI told Elon, any conflicts, you can‚Äôt have anything to do with that,‚Äù said President Trump in a press conference this week, in response to a question about Musk, SpaceX, the FAA, and conflicts of interest. ‚ÄúSo anything to do with possibly even space, we won‚Äôt let Elon partake in that.‚Äù\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSpaceX is directly regulated by a small FAA agency called the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which since 1984 has licensed the launch of US space rockets. ‚ÄúThe purpose is to ensure public safety,‚Äù says George Nield, a former associate administrator of the office. ‚ÄúPeople on the ground did not consent‚Äù to rocket launches above them, he says. ‚ÄùWe absolutely need to keep them safe. The office has done a great job of that.‚Äù The office oversaw 157 launches in 2024 alone.\nOn February 10, several days after Musk posted on X that DOGE ‚Äúwill aim to make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system,‚Äù a group of Democratic legislators wrote to Rocheleau‚Äîa career civil servant whose ties to the FAA go back to 1996‚Äîrequesting information about any planned changes to FAA systems.\n‚ÄúWe are extremely concerned that an ad hoc team of individuals lacking any expertise, exposure, certifications, or knowledge of aviation operations being invited, or inserting themselves, to make ‚Äòrapid‚Äô changes to our nation‚Äôs air traffic systems,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúAviation safety is not an area to ‚Äòmove fast and break things.‚Äô‚Äù\nUpdated February 24, 2025, at 11:15 am EDT: This story was updated with a clarification of which employees were included in the recent layoffs.",

    "content_text": "One of the first things Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) did was push for extreme cuts to the United States‚Äô primary international aid agency, the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Musk insisted that USAID was too wasteful and corrupt to exist, but by effectively dismantling the agency, DOGE ended projects like the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (Fews Net), a long-running, broadly successful data analysis initiative that provides guidance to ensure that food aid is delivered in the least-wasteful way possible.\nDeprived of USAID funding, the Fews Net program is currently offline. The international development firm Chemonics, which staffs a large portion of the project, says it has furloughed 88 percent of its US-based workforce. For now, that means the United States may be facing a new, less efficient era of food assistance, one that could leave the country more vulnerable to future global crises.\nThe goal of Fews Net is to crunch a wide array of variables‚Äîfrom weather patterns to armed conflicts‚Äîto predict where famines will occur ahead of time and deploy resources to prevent and curb disasters. Its reports are used both internally by USAID and by other governments, nonprofit groups, and aid agencies around the world. It can‚Äôt flat-out prevent people from going hungry or guarantee that foreign governments will take its recommendations, but it has a fruitful track record of providing advance warnings and guidance that keep people alive. For example, Fews Net has been credited with saving up to a million lives in 2016, when it predicted and responded to a famine in the Horn of Africa.\n‚ÄúWe are really a pillar,‚Äù says Laouali Ibrahim, a former Fews Net West Africa regional technical manager who retired last year. ‚ÄúIf you withdraw Fews Net, systems will collapse. The quality of early warnings will decrease.‚Äù\nA current Fews Net worker in southern Africa, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they are currently furloughed and still hopeful the program might restart, tells WIRED that some countries are already feeling the impact of the program going offline, especially since it‚Äôs the ‚Äúlean season,‚Äù the time when food aid is most acutely needed. While the United Nations and private-sector programs still offer their own insights into how to distribute aid, the worker says that Fews Net produced more timely reports. ‚ÄúIt leaves a huge gap,‚Äù the worker says.\nUSAID launched Fews Net in 1985 in response to a series of famines that ravaged Ethiopia and Africa‚Äôs Sahel region. The severity of the humanitarian disaster sparked a new wave of interest in humanitarian aid. (Remember the celebrity-studded song to raise money for the cause, ‚ÄúWe Are the World?‚Äù)\nThe Trump administration‚Äôs stance on foreign aid today is markedly more negative, but secretary of state Marco Rubio, who is currently serving as acting administrator of USAID, has repeatedly emphasized that DOGE‚Äôs cuts do not represent the total end of US international assistance. Rubio‚Äôs office has offered emergency waivers to allow ‚Äúlifesaving‚Äù work to continue, but many aid groups say the system is not working, causing a number of crucial programs, including HIV medical assistance, to screech to a halt. Similarly, even though predicting and detecting famines can save lives, Fews Net‚Äôs work is currently on hold.\nChemonics spokesperson Payal Chandiramani says USAID has indicated that Fews Net should qualify for a waiver, and it is working with the agency to determine how it should apply. USAID and the US State Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Kateknibbs.09.\nFrom the beginning, Fews Net was notable for the sheer range of variables that it factored into its analyses. In addition to looking at more obvious signals‚Äîsuch as drought levels and current grain supplies in different countries‚Äîit also examined tertiary causes. ‚ÄúLike locusts,‚Äù says historian Christian Ruth, whose forthcoming book on the history of USAID will be published later this year. The swarming grasshoppers can have a devastating effect on crops, especially in Africa, which can then spark or exacerbate ongoing food supply issues. Fews Net used satellite imaging to predict where problematic spikes in locust populations might lead to swarms.\nTo make predictions, Fews Net leveraged artificial intelligence models that could estimate the likelihood of political conflict. It monitored markets, trade, and on-the-ground household finances in local communities to predict economic causes of famine.

    "content_text": "Humans have been selectively breeding cats and dogs for thousands of years to make more desirable pets. A new startup called the Los Angeles Project aims to speed up that process with genetic engineering to make glow-in-the-dark rabbits, hypoallergenic cats and dogs, and possibly, one day, actual unicorns.\nThe Los Angeles Project is the brainchild of biohacker Josie Zayner, who in 2017 publicly injected herself with the gene-editing tool Crispr during a conference in San Francisco and livestreamed it. ‚ÄúI want to help humans genetically modify themselves,‚Äù she said at the time. She‚Äôs also given herself a fecal transplant and a DIY Covid vaccine and is the founder and CEO of The Odin, a company that sells home genetic-engineering kits.\nNow, Zayner wants to create the next generation of pets. ‚ÄúI think, as a human species, it‚Äôs kind of our moral prerogative to level up animals,‚Äù she says.\nCofounded with biotech entrepreneur Cathy Tie, a former Thiel Fellow, the Los Angeles Project is all about making animals that are ‚Äúmore complex and interesting and beautiful and unique‚Äù than ones that currently exist, Zayner says. The Austin-based company‚Äôs name is a nod to another controversial effort‚Äîthe Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb during WWII.\nFor the past year, the Los Angeles Project has been operating in stealth mode while its five-person team has been experimenting on embryos from frogs, fish, hamsters, and rabbits. They‚Äôve used Crispr to delete genes and insert new ones‚Äîthe latter being more technically difficult to achieve. They‚Äôre also testing out a lesser-known technique known as restriction enzyme mediated integration, or REMI, for integrating new DNA into embryos. Making these modifications at the embryo level changes the genetic makeup of the resulting animal.\nThe team has used Crispr to add a gene to rabbit embryos so they produce green fluorescent protein, or GFP. Zayner says they‚Äôre aiming to transfer the engineered embryos to female rabbits this week. If all goes well, the company will have glowing baby bunnies in a month. (Rabbits have a gestation period of just 31 to 33 days.)\nThey won‚Äôt be the first glowing animals ever created. GFP is commonly used by scientists to visually track and monitor gene activity or cellular processes within an organism, often to study diseases. Researchers have previously made fluorescent rodents, monkeys, dogs, cats, and rabbits, but none of these animals were created for commercial purposes. But the Los Angeles Project is designing glowing bunnies and other animals to sell to consumers. ‚ÄúI think the pet space is huge and totally undervalued,‚Äù Zayner says.\nFish genetically engineered to have the GFP protein are sold in pet stores across the country. Called GloFish, they were made with an older technique called recombinant DNA technology. The company that developed the fish, Yorktown Technologies, sold the brand for $50 million in 2017.\nThe Los Angeles Project is starting with the GFP edit because it‚Äôs relatively simple. It‚Äôs also observable in embryos when they‚Äôre exposed to blue or ultraviolet light, showing that the gene editing worked. After fluorescent bunnies, the company has its sights on making cats that lack the Fel d1 protein, the primary allergen that cats produce, but also jackalopes, dragons, and unicorns. But more complex editing will be needed to achieve those more ambitious creations.\n‚ÄúAs we continue, our goal is to really look at multiple genes at the same time, really understand the multiple genes that contribute towards a very complex trait, and then be able to transfer those changes from one species to another,‚Äù Tie says. One company, eGenesis, has made pigs with 69 gene edits to make their organs more compatible for human transplants.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm personally really interested in the unicorn,‚Äù Tie says. It‚Äôs a tall order that would require understanding the genetics behind the narwhal‚Äôs twisted horn, then figuring out how to transfer it into a small animal first before engineering it into a horse. ‚ÄúBig ideas take a long time to achieve, and as a company, you have to evolve to meet the needs of the market but also really understand the long-term vision of the technology that you‚Äôre building,‚Äù she says.\nThe idea of making gene-edited pets is sure to raise eyebrows. In fact, bioethicists warned about such ‚Äúfrivolous‚Äù uses of CRISPR a decade ago when the technology was in its infancy. The company‚Äôs glowing rabbits will be an initial test to see how consumers respond.\n‚ÄúI think most people are going to think it‚Äôs crazy and will dismiss it as crazy,‚Äù says Andy Weissman of Union Square Ventures, who has personally invested in the Los Angeles Project. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to convince people to come into a reality that doesn‚Äôt yet exist.‚Äù\nHe sees the company as part business, part art project. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find out if they can accomplish both, or just one or the other.‚Äù\nThere‚Äôs the question of what happens if something goes wrong. Crispr can cause unintended edits, which could lead to cancer or other health problems in an animal. Plus, no one really knows how many edits can be made to an animal‚Äôs genome without causing harm.\n‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to harm animals,‚Äù Tie says. Both she and Zayner say they take the treatment of animals seriously. The company has not killed any animals for its experiments and doesn‚Äôt plan to. They create the embryos by mixing eggs and sperm sourced from ovaries and testes they get from veterinarians and a local butcher.\nAnd GloFish offer a cautionary tale. In Brazil, the fluorescent fish have escaped fish farms and are multiplying in creeks in the Atlantic Forest, raising concerns about whether they pose a threat to native species. Zayner says the animals they create would be spayed and neutered so they wouldn‚Äôt be able to reproduce and pass on the genetic changes to offspring,\nThe company has been in touch with the US Food and Drug Administration about its plans, but it‚Äôs unclear how the agency would regulate them. Back in 2003, the FDA determined that the sale of transgenic GloFish were not subject to regulation, based on evidence that the fish do not pose a risk to public health or the environment.\nZayner‚Äôs new venture will no doubt test the bounds of gene-editing regulation, as her self-experimentation and DIY genetic engineering kits have in the past. But the Los Angeles Project may also spark much-needed societal conversations around what humans can‚Äîand should‚Äîdo with genetic engineering.\n‚ÄúThe crazy thing is, this technology is so advanced, and nobody‚Äôs doing shit with it,‚Äù Zayner says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kind of our motto: Let‚Äôs do stuff with it.‚Äù",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nApple has launched a new iPhone, but what was expected to be a new iPhone SE announcement this morning has turned into a completely new product line: the iPhone 16e. This isn't exactly a follow-up to the iPhone SE from three years ago, though it officially replaces it. Also gone is the iPhone 14, meaning Apple's iPhone lineup now consists of the iPhone 16e, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16 series. Apple announced the new device online without much fanfare.\nThe iPhone 16e is available for preorder starting on February 21 for $599, which effectively eliminates the option of a sub-$500 iPhone. Official sales kick off on February 28. Here's what's new with Apple's latest iPhone.\nA Modern, ‚ÄòCheaper‚Äô iPhone\nThe new iPhone 16E, which is a spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, says goodbye to hallmarks like the Touch ID-infused home button and thick bezels around the display in favor of the modern look that's been headlining Apple's iPhones for the past few years. That means an all-screen front, now employing an OLED panel, with Face ID baked into the camera notch.\nUnlike the current iPhone 16 lineup, this iPhone does not use the Dynamic Island system of a floating bar around the front-facing camera that shows live information from apps like Maps and Uber. Here, the camera notch is just a static void. The screen is 6.1 inches, the same size as the iPhone 16, a big leap from the 4.7-inch screen on the third-gen iPhone SE. This is not a tiny phone anymore, a blow to anyone hoping for another small iPhone‚Äîespecially since Apple killed off the iPhone Mini series a few years ago.\nAnnoyingly, this iPhone is still stuck with a 60-Hz screen refresh rate even though most other smartphones at this price feature a 90- or 120-Hz refresh rate. A higher rate means a smoother experience using the phone with fluid animations. Apple calls this ProMotion, and it's still only available in the iPhone Pro series, though it's expected to arrive in the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Plus later this year for the first time.\nAlso notable is the switch from a Lightning charging port to a USB-C port. Apple first switched to the universal port on the iPhone 15 range in 2023, and this update means the entire iPhone lineup finally features USB-C. Unfortunately, like the iPhone 16, the port's data transfer speeds remain the same at 480 Mbps. For faster speeds, you'll need to buy the iPhone 16 Pro.\nApple stopped selling the 2022 model of the iPhone SE and other Lightning-based devices in the European Union in December 2024 to comply with regulations that required the universal USB-C port on devices like phones and tablets. The earlier-than-expected release of the iPhone 16e suggests Apple wanted to quickly fill in the gap and bring a low-cost iPhone back to that market.\n|Specs\n|iPhone 16e (2025)\n|Display:\n|6.1 inches, OLED, 60 Hz\n|Build:\n|Aluminum and Ceramic Shield\n|Processor and RAM:\n|Apple A18 with 8 GB of RAM\n|Storage:\n|128, 256, and 512 GB\n|Cameras:\n|48-megapixel main camera, 12-MP selfie camera\n|Extras:\n|Qi wireless charging, Face ID, USB-C\n|Colors:\n|Black, White\n|Price:\n|$599\nApple's A18 chipset sits inside with 8 GB of RAM, meaning you get the same power as the iPhone 16. Nearly. This chipset has one less GPU core than the A18 inside the iPhone 16, meaning there may be a slight hit to graphics performance when playing games. Naturally, the A18 chip brings access to Apple Intelligence. It's the most affordable iPhone with the suite of AI features, though it's not the cheapest way to access it. That would be the $499 iPad Mini.\nWhile Apple has brought over the Action Button from the higher-end iPhones‚Äîthis user-customizable button replaced the mute switch and debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro‚Äîthe 16e is missing the Camera Control button found on those flagship devices.\nCamera Control is the fifth physical button on the iPhone 16 lineup. It enables quick access to the camera and allows users to slide a finger on it to change shooting modes. Pressing and holding the button activates Apple‚Äôs Visual Intelligence, which lets Siri understand what it's looking at, provide context, and take action. Apple initially restricted the feature to the new iPhone 16 range which has the physical Camera Control button, even if the iPhone 15 Pro was capable of this computer vision trick. However, the iPhone 16e can now make use of Visual Intelligence through the Action Button. (Update: Apple confirmed Visual Intelligence will come to the iPhone 15 Pro via a software update, enabling you to activate it through the Action Button or Control Center.)\nSpeaking of the camera, it's been upgraded to a 48-megapixel sensor, and Apple touts that the higher megapixel count allows the camera to crop in and offer a 2X optical-like image quality‚Äîeffectively giving you the experience of two camera lenses in one. The selfie camera is the same 12 megapixels as the rest of the iPhone 16 series.\nThe other big introduction is Apple's first in-house 5G modem, the C1. This new chip further reduces the company's dependence on external chip suppliers like Qualcomm. This modem won't allow the iPhone 16e to connect to millimeter-wave 5G‚Äîthe superfast 5G speeds you'll find in certain locations, like dense urban areas, airports, or stadiums. This is a common omission on phones within this price range, which rely on the more widespread sub-6 GHz 5G spectrum.\nApple says the new C1 modem helps improve battery life. The iPhone 16e's battery can last 21 hours when streaming videos, which is 11 more hours than the iPhone SE, and it's even better than the 18-hour claim for the same-sized iPhone 16. Bizarrely, Apple did not add Qi2 and MagSafe functionality to this iPhone, gatekeeping its magnetic accessory system to pricier devices. The iPhone 16e still supports Qi wireless charging, which is slower and doesn't have the benefits of magnets.\nWhat it does retain are the satellite communication features that debuted in the iPhone 14‚Äîwhen you're away from cellular coverage and Wi-Fi, you can message friends and family via satellite and also connect to emergency services and roadside assistance. You can also share your location via satellite through the Find My app. The iPhone 16e also includes Apple's Crash Detection, which can contact emergency services if the device detects you've been in a car crash.\nThe iPhone 16e makes the iPhone lineup a little confusing because Apple still sells the iPhone 15 ($699) and iPhone 15 Plus ($799), which are more expensive but have a weaker processor that lacks access to Apple Intelligence. Unless you really want an ultrawide camera, MagSafe, or the Dynamic Island, there doesn't seem to be much reason to buy them anymore.",

Apple initially restricted the feature to the new iPhone 16 range which has the physical Camera Control button, even if the iPhone 15 Pro was capable of this computer vision trick. However, the iPhone 16e can now make use of Visual Intelligence through the Action Button. (<strong>Update:</strong> Apple confirmed Visual Intelligence will come to the iPhone 15 Pro via a software update, enabling you to activate it through the Action Button or Control Center.)</p><p class=\"paywall\">Speaking of the camera, it's been upgraded to a 48-megapixel sensor, and Apple touts that the higher megapixel count allows the camera to crop in and offer a 2X optical-like image quality‚Äîeffectively giving you the experience of two camera lenses in one. The selfie camera is the same 12 megapixels as the rest of the iPhone 16 series.</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nHave you looked closely at your earbuds lately? I did, and I was horrified at how gross they were. My trusty Apple AirPods had become so mucky and caked in ear wax I was genuinely embarrassed, and almost reluctant to put something so nasty back in my ears.\nBut are my yellowing Airpods actually a risk to my health? I asked physician Jonathan Webster, from Doctify, who explained that while earwax is protective and part of the normal cleaning process of the ear, ‚Äúproblems arise because long-term use of the earbuds prevents the wax from naturally migrating outwards‚Äîand so it builds up, trapping moisture, and making it prone to getting infected.‚Äù\nEarbuds can also push earwax deeper into the ear canal, leading to blockages and discomfort. There‚Äôs a reason your ENT surgeon likes the saying ‚ÄúDo not put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear.‚Äù Webster also explained that ‚Äúthere has definitely been a rise in problems associated with earbud use, including hearing loss, tinnitus, and infections.‚Äù\nHearing loss has little to do with my poor headphone cleanliness, but it is worth remembering that ‚Äúprolonged exposure to loud noise can damage the very delicate hair cells in the inner ear (cochlear), leading to permanent hearing loss. With the in-ear headphones, there is a concentration of the sound directed into the ear, which may make it more likely to cause a problem.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs also worth noting that the UK‚Äôs National Health Service advises that headphone users should not listen to music at higher than 60 percent of the maximum volume, and not for more than an hour at a time.\nCan Dirty Earbuds Really Cause Infections?\nThere‚Äôs not been a huge amount of clinical research into headphone cleanliness, but according to an investigation by ABC 11 back in 2019, microbiologist Michael Taveirne, from North Carolina State University, swabbed several different headphones and sent the cultures in for testing. The results showed staphylococcus and pseudomonas, two types of bacteria that can cause infection under the right circumstances.\nSimilarly, according to a Florida-based ENT specialist, headphones house around 2,700 times more bacteria than the average cutting board, or six times more bacteria than the kitchen sink. That‚Äôs pretty gross‚Äîbut even then you‚Äôre not guaranteed to get infected.\nBacteria isn‚Äôt inherently problematic, but if your earbuds don‚Äôt fit properly and you‚Äôre always fiddling with them, there‚Äôs a higher risk of you scraping or damaging the ear canal, which will create the perfect conditions for bacteria to thrive. Add in sweat from sports, and hours of daily wear, and you could be in for a nasty surprise.\nHow to Clean Your Earbuds\nSo, your earbuds are disgusting‚Äîbut fortunately, it is surprisingly easy to restore their cleanliness safely with just a few household essentials.\n- Disinfectant spray or wipes: Alcohol-free wipes and sprays won't harm rubber, plastic, silicone, or acrylic, but will make quick work of your grubby buds, dissolving wax quickly.\n- Earbud cleaning tool: There are countless options available, each designed to get into the smallest spaces. But before you invest, try using an old toothbrush or Q-tip first.\n- A microfiber cloth: If you have a lens cleaner with your sunglasses this will work fine, although specific tech cloths are available. The key is to use a fabric that won‚Äôt scratch and will minimize static build-up.\n- Soapy water: A mild soap without added moisturizers will remove any exterior residue. Check the IP water resistance rating of your buds before you do anything other than a careful wipe.\n- Silica gel pack: Chuck one in your gym kit bag along with your headphones and it will help to absorb excess moisture.\nSome people recommend using isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), but do so with caution as it can damage certain materials. If you do, always dilute it with water and use a small amount on a soft, lint-free cloth.\nApple has a comprehensive guide to AirPod maintenance that is equally relevant for other earbud brands. The main takeaway from its guide is that everything from soap to moisturizer, hair dye, and acidic food can stain your earbuds, but a quick wipe with a disinfectant wipe should do the trick.\nSimilarly, Kimberley Bradshaw from Hearing Aid UK suggests ‚Äúwiping down your earbuds and case with a microfiber cloth after each use [especially after sport] to remove dirt and sweat. Alcohol-free disinfectant wipes are great for earbuds, but avoid getting moisture on the internal parts.‚Äù\nUse a cotton bud or old toothbrush: This ensures that you can get deep into every corner. With AirPods, for instance, the protective mesh over the ear tip gets blocked easily, but a quick brush should remove even the smallest particles. Having done this, I also noticed my headphones sounded better too.\nSoak your ear tips: Once you‚Äôve removed any wax or dust, let the silicone tips soak in soapy water for half an hour. Dry thoroughly before reattaching them to the headphones.\nDon't forget the cable: If you‚Äôre a hipster or an audiophile you may still have wired headphones. You‚Äôd be surprised how often you touch the cable, so remember to give it a regular wipe to remove any bacteria buildup.\nClean the charging case: There‚Äôs no point cleaning your buds if you‚Äôre just going to plonk them back in a wax-smeared charging cradle. A once-over inside with a clean cotton bud will remove any debris and keep the charging points clear. The outside can be wiped down with soapy water, although avoid contact with the charging socket. Remember to remove any dust from the socket with the toothbrush or (carefully) with a bent paperclip if it‚Äôs really impacted.\nHeadphone Cleaning Kits\nIf you want to go to town on your wax-off overhaul, here are our recommended all-in-one solutions to give your earbuds (and your ears) a treat.\n- iFixit Precision Cleaning Kit: This includes 12 precision cleaning tips and contact cleaning liquid that‚Äôs safe for electronics. A bargain at $10.\n- Belkin AirPods Cleaning Kit: A simple, Apple-approved cleaning kit consisting of a brush, cleaning liquid, deionized water, microfiber, and cloth.\n- Jlab headphone cleaning kit: Multipurpose one-piece tech cleaning kit with push-up pen nib for getting in the cracks, refillable cleaning spray bottle, soft sponge, and brush‚Äîplus the outer case is covered in microfiber for polishing.",

    "content_text": "On the final day of my visit to Japan, I‚Äôm alone and floating in some skyscraper‚Äôs rooftop hot springs, praying no one joins me. For the last few months, I‚Äôve been using ChatGPT‚Äôs Advanced Voice Mode as an AI language tutor, part of a test to judge generative AI‚Äôs potential as both a learning tool and a travel companion. The excessive talking to both strangers and a chatbot on my phone was illuminating as well as exhausting. I‚Äôm ready to shut my yapper for a minute and enjoy the silence.\nWhen OpenAI launched ChatGPT late in 2022, it set off a firestorm of generative AI competition and public interest. Over two years later, many people are still unsure whether it can be useful in their daily lives outside of work.\nA video from OpenAI in May of 2024 showing two researchers chatting back and forth, one in English and the other in Spanish, with ChatGPT acting as a low-latency interpreter, stuck in my memory. I wondered how practical the Advanced Voice Mode could be for learning how to speak bits of a new language and whether it‚Äôs a worthwhile app for travelers.\nTo better understand how AI voice tools might transform the future of language learning, I spent a month practicing Japanese with the ChatGPT smartphone app before traveling to Tokyo for the first time. Outside of watching some anime, I had zero working knowledge of the language. During conversation sessions with the Advanced Voice Mode that usually lasted around 30 minutes, I often approached it as my synthetic, over-the-phone language tutor, practicing basic travel phrases for navigating transportation, restaurants, and retail shops.\nOn a previous trip, I‚Äôd used Duolingo, a smartphone app with language-learning quizzes and games, to brush up on my Spanish. I was curious how ChatGPT would compare. I often test new AI tools to understand their benefits and limitations, and I was eager to see if this approach to language learning could be the killer feature that makes these tools more appealing to more people.\nMe and My AI Language Tutor\nJackie Shannon, an OpenAI product lead for multimodal AI and ChatGPT, claims to use the chatbot to practice Spanish vocabulary words as she‚Äôs driving to the office. She suggests beginners like me start by using it to learn phrases first‚Äîmore knowledgeable learners can immediately try free-flowing dialogs with the AI tool. ‚ÄúI think they should dive straight into conversation,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúLike, ‚ÄòHelp me have a conversation about the news on X.‚Äô Or, ‚ÄòHelp me practice ordering dinner.‚Äô‚Äù\nSo I worked on useful travel phrases with ChatGPT and acting out roleplaying scenarios, like pretending to order food and making small talk at an izakaya restaurant. Nothing really stuck during the first two weeks, and I began to get nervous, but around week three I started to gain a loose grip on a few key Japanese phrases for travelers, and I felt noticeably less anxious about the impending interactions in another language.\nChatGPT is not necessarily designed with language acquisition in mind. ‚ÄúThis is a tool that has a number of different use cases, and it hasn't been optimized for language learning or translation yet,‚Äù says Shannon. The generalized nature of the chatbot‚Äôs default settings can lead to a frustrating blandness of interactions at first, but after a few interactions ChatGPT‚Äôs memory feature caught on fairly quickly that I was planning for a Japan trip and wanted speaking practice.\nThe ‚Äúmemory‚Äù instructions for ChatGPT are passively updated by the software during conversations, and they impact how the AI talks to you. Go into the account settings to adjust or delete any of this information. An active way you can adjust the tool to be better suited for learning languages is to open the ‚Äúcustom instructions‚Äù options and lay out your goals for the learning experience.\nWhat frustrated me most was the incessant, unspecific guideline violation alerts during voice interactions, which ruined the flow of the conversation. ChatGPT would trigger a warning when I asked it to repeat a phrase multiple times, for example. (Extreme repetition is sometimes a method used by people hoping to break a generative AI tool‚Äôs guardrails.) Shannon says OpenAI rolled out improvements related to what triggers a violation for Advanced Voice Mode and is looking to find a balance that prioritizes safety.\nAlso, be warned that Advanced Voice Mode can be a bit of a yes-man. If you don‚Äôt request it to role-play as a tough-ass tutor, you may find the personality to be saccharine and annoying‚ÄîI did. A handful of times ChatGPT congratulated me for doing a fabulous job after I definitely butchered a Japanese pronunciation. When I asked it to provide more detailed feedback to really teach me the language, the tool still wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was able to respond in a manner that fit my learning style better.\nComparing the overall experience to my past time with Duolingo, OpenAI‚Äôs chatbot was more elastic, with a wider range of learning possibilities, whereas Duolingo‚Äôs games were more habit forming and structured. Are ChatGPT‚Äôs language abilities an existential threat to Duolingo? Not according to Klinton Bicknell, Duolingo‚Äôs head of AI. ‚ÄúIf you're motivated right now, you can go to ChatGPT and get it to teach you something, including a language,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúDuolingo‚Äôs success is providing a fun experience that's engaging and rewarding.‚Äù\nThe company partnered with OpenAI in the past and is currently using its AI models to power a feature where users can have conversations with an animated character to practice speaking skills.\nPutting ChatGPT to the Test in Tokyo\nChatGPT really became useful when I wanted to practice a phrase or two before saying it while out and about in Tokyo. Over and over, I whispered into my smartphone on the sidewalk, requesting reminders of how to ask for food recommendations or confess that I don‚Äôt understand Japanese very well.\nUsing Advanced Voice Mode to translate back and forth live may be great for longer conversations you‚Äôd want to have in more intimate settings, but at a buzzy restaurant, crowded shrine, or other common tourist spots in Japan, it‚Äôs just easier to do asynchronous translations with the tool.\nAt a barbecue spot with an all-you-can-drink special and a mini-keg of lemon sour right under the table, the food came out but not the requested drinking mugs. I had a tough time requesting them. The waitress was patient with us as I spoke a few lines into ChatGPT and showed her the translation on my smartphone. She then explained I hadn‚Äôt yet signed a waiver promising not to drink and drive and brought out a form to sign. A few minutes later, she returned with the mug. In this instance, OpenAI‚Äôs chatbot was quite helpful, but I likely would have been just fine using the Google Translate app.\nMore times than I would like to admit, though, the phrases I thought I had down pat by practicing with ChatGPT ended up sloshing around in my head and embarrassing me. For example, while trying to get back to the hotel around 10 pm via the train, I got disoriented looking for the correct station exit. I was able to ask for help from one of the station staff members, but instead of saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù (arigato gozaimasu) at the end, my tired mind blurted out the phrase for ‚Äúthis one, please‚Äù (kore wo onegaishimasu) as I confidently strode away.\nAfter a month of ChatGPT practice, did I really know Japanese? Of course not. But a few of the polite greetings and touristy phrases stuck well enough, most of the time at least, to navigate my way around Tokyo and feel like I could really enjoy the thrill of adventure in a new country.\nAs generative AI tools improve, they will keep getting better at helping language learners practice speaking skills, as well as their reading skills. Tomotaro Akizawa, an associate professor and program coordinator at Stanford‚Äôs Inter-University Center for Japanese Language Studies in Yokohama, gives me an example. ‚ÄúStudents who have just completed the beginner level can now try to read challenging literary works from the Sh≈çwa era by using AI for translations, explanations, and word lists,‚Äù he says.\nIf students eventually end up relying only on generative AI tools and go their entire language learning journey sans human instructor, then the complexities of spoken language and communication may get flattened over time.\n‚ÄúThe opportunity to personally experience the human elements embedded in the target language‚Äîsuch as emotions, thoughts, hesitations, or struggles‚Äîwould be lost,‚Äù says associate professor Akizawa. ‚ÄúWords spoken in conversation are not always as structured as those from a large language model.‚Äù AI may be more patient with you than a human tutor, but language learners risk losing the rough edges and experience-based insights.\nHave you tried to learn to do anything with AI? Would you feel confident using AI to help with translation in public? Let us know your experiences by emailing hello@wired.com or commenting below.",

For the last few months, I‚Äôve been using ChatGPT‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-advanced-voice-mode-first-impressions/\">Advanced Voice Mode</a> as an AI language tutor, part of a test to judge generative AI‚Äôs potential as both a learning tool and a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/48-hours-in-tokyo-with-my-ai-travel-companion/\">travel companion</a>. The excessive talking to both strangers and a chatbot on my phone was illuminating as well as exhausting. I‚Äôm ready to shut my yapper for a minute and enjoy the silence.</p><p class=\"paywall\">When <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/openai/https://www.wired.com/tag/openai/\">OpenAI</a> launched <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a> late in 2022, it set off a firestorm of generative AI competition and public interest. Over two years later, many people are still unsure whether it can be useful in their daily lives outside of work.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzUnEfiIqP4\">video from OpenAI in May</a> of 2024 showing two researchers chatting back and forth, one in English and the other in Spanish, with ChatGPT acting as a low-latency interpreter, stuck in my memory. I wondered how practical the Advanced Voice Mode could be for learning how to speak bits of a new language and whether it‚Äôs a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/japan-travel-useful-apps/\">worthwhile app for travelers</a>.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">To better understand how AI voice tools might transform the future of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-language-learning-apps/\">language learning</a>, I spent a month practicing Japanese with the ChatGPT smartphone app before traveling to Tokyo for the first time. Outside of watching some anime, I had zero working knowledge of the language. During conversation sessions with the Advanced Voice Mode that usually lasted around 30 minutes, I often approached it as my synthetic, over-the-phone language tutor, practicing basic travel phrases for navigating <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/category/business/transportation/\">transportation</a>, restaurants, and retail shops.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">On a previous trip, I‚Äôd used <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/duolingo-language-learning-family-relationships/\">Duolingo</a>, a smartphone app with language-learning quizzes and games, to brush up on my Spanish. I was curious how ChatGPT would compare. I often <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ai-financial-advisers-apps-chatbots/\">test new AI tools</a> to understand their benefits and limitations, and I was eager to see if this approach to language learning could be the killer feature that makes these tools more appealing to more people.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Me and My AI Language Tutor</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Jackie Shannon, an OpenAI product lead for multimodal AI and ChatGPT, claims to use the chatbot to practice Spanish vocabulary words as she‚Äôs driving to the office. She suggests beginners like me start by using it to learn phrases first‚Äîmore knowledgeable learners can immediately try free-flowing dialogs with the AI tool. ‚ÄúI think they should dive straight into conversation,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúLike, ‚ÄòHelp me have a conversation about the news on X.‚Äô Or, ‚ÄòHelp me practice ordering dinner.‚Äô‚Äù</p><p class=\"paywall\">So I worked on useful travel phrases with ChatGPT and acting out roleplaying scenarios, like pretending to order food and making small talk at an <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/finding-the-real-midnight-diner/\">izakaya restaurant</a>. Nothing really stuck during the first two weeks, and I began to get nervous, but around week three I started to gain a loose grip on a few key Japanese phrases for travelers, and I felt noticeably less anxious about the impending interactions in another language.</p><p class=\"paywall\">ChatGPT is not necessarily designed with language acquisition in mind. ‚ÄúThis is a tool that has a number of different use cases, and it hasn't been optimized for language learning or translation yet,‚Äù says Shannon. The generalized nature of the chatbot‚Äôs default settings can lead to a frustrating blandness of interactions at first, but after a few interactions ChatGPT‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-chatgpt-memory-feature/\">memory feature</a> caught on fairly quickly that I was planning for a Japan trip and wanted speaking practice.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "For more than a decade now, Russian cyberwarfare has used Ukraine as a test lab for its latest hacking techniques, methods that often target Ukrainians first before they're deployed more broadly. Now Google is warning of a Russian espionage trick that's been used to obtain Ukrainians' messages on the encrypted platform Signal‚Äîand one that both Ukrainians and other Signal users worldwide should protect themselves against with a new update to the app.\nGoogle's threat intelligence team on Wednesday released a report revealing how multiple hacker groups that serve Russian state interests are targeting Signal, the end-to-end encrypted messaging tool that has become widely accepted as a standard for private communications and is now often used by Ukrainians, including in the Ukrainian military's battlefield communications. Those Russia-linked groups, which Google has given the working names UNC5792 and UNC4221, are taking advantage of a Signal feature that allows users to join a Signal group by scanning a QR code from their phone. By sending phishing messages to victims, often over Signal itself, both hacker groups have spoofed those group invites in the form of QR codes that instead hide javascript commands that link the victim's phone to a new device‚Äîin this case, one in the hands of an eavesdropper who can then read every message the target sends or receives.\n‚ÄúIt looks exactly like a group invite, and everything would function exactly like that, except when you scan it, it links the device out,‚Äù says Dan Black, a Google cyberespionage researcher and former NATO analyst. ‚ÄúIt instantly pairs your device with theirs. And all your messages are now, in real time, being delivered over to the threat actor while you're receiving them.‚Äù\nTwo months ago, Google began warning the Signal Foundation that maintains the private communications platform about Russia's use of the QR code phishing technique, and Signal last week finished rolling out an update for iOS and Android designed to counter the trick. The new safeguard warns users when they link a new device and checks with them again at a randomized interval a few hours after that device is added to confirm that they still want to share all messages with it. Signal now also requires a form of authentication such as entering a passcode or using FaceID or TouchID on iOS to add a new linked device.\nIn fact, Signal had already been working to update those forms of phishing protections aimed specifically at exploitation of its linked device feature prior to Google's warning, says Signal's senior technologist, Josh Lund. But Google's report about Russia's spying in Ukraine provided an ‚Äúacute‚Äù example of the problem that pushed them to move quickly to protect users, he says.\n‚ÄúWe're really grateful to the Google team for their help in making Signal more resilient to this type of social engineering,‚Äù says Lund, using the cybersecurity term for tricks that deceive victims into giving hackers sensitive information or access to their systems.\nBoth Google and Signal emphasized that the phishing technique Google has seen in use in Ukraine doesn't suggest that Signal's encryption is broken or that the app's messages can otherwise be eavesdropped in transit. Instead, the trick essentially combines two legitimate features‚ÄîQR-code group invites and QR-code device linking that pairs a smartphone with a laptop‚Äîinvisibly swapping one with the other to deceive users. ‚ÄúPhishing is a big problem on the internet, and it's never nice to hear that someone has fallen victim to one of these attacks,‚Äù Lund says. ‚ÄúBut we're trying to do our best to keep users safe, and we think these recent improvements will really help.‚Äù\nGoogle notes that it's seen Russia use similar techniques to target other communications platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, too. But the hackers tied to Russia's military have focused on Signal because of its widespread tactical use in the Ukrainian military. One of the two hacker groups that has exploited the QR code phishing technique, for instance, has disguised the codes as invites to groups associated with an artillery guidance app used by the Ukrainian military called Kropyva. In other instances, the spoofed QR codes have impersonated invites to other groups from a trusted contact, or security alerts from Signal itself.\nRussia's hackers have targeted Signal as part of the country's war efforts in Ukraine since as early as 2023, a year into its full-scale invasion, says Google's Black. That's when the Russian hacker group known as Sandworm, a notorious unit of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, began pivoting from disruptive cyberattacks to tactical espionage that included penetrating tablet computers used by the Ukrainian military. In some cases, Sandworm's hackers have also aided front-line Russian troops in off-loading Signal messages from captured devices, including by using the linked-device feature to pair compromised phones with their own PCs. Google says that Turla, a hacker group linked to Russia's FSB security agency, has also targeted Signal messages on PCs that it's infected with malware.\nGoogle's Black says that the company's analysts nonetheless waited to highlight Russia's use of the QR-code phishing technique to target Signal until the Signal Foundation could push out new protections, in part to prevent other hackers from copying the technique. Black warns, in fact, that Russia's targeting of Signal in Ukraine shouldn't be seen as a problem limited to Ukraine nor to military conflicts in general. The trick is just as likely to be used for targeting dissidents and activists who use Signal worldwide, or even a broader set of targets. In December, for instance, US officials recommended Americans use end-to-end encrypted apps in response to the Chinese hacker group Salt Typhoon's widespread penetrations of US telecom networks.\n‚ÄúThe use case for these techniques is just so wide,\" says Black. ‚ÄúWe've seen history tell us a very particular story in terms of tradecraft, that the things that happen in Ukraine don't seem to stay confined there.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "As Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency rampages through the US government, its access to sensitive data is alarming federal agencies and Americans who interact with them. In the month since the Trump administration began its purge of federal workers, opponents fighting DOGE in court have been pinning their hopes of stopping the world‚Äôs richest man on a 50-year-old law.\nIn just a few weeks, DOGE staffers have accessed federal employee records at the Office of Personnel Management, government payment data at the Department of the Treasury, data on student loan recipients at the Department of Education, information on disaster victims at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and vast amounts of employment- and workplace-related data at the Department of Labor. White House staffers are even pressuring the Internal Revenue Service to grant DOGE access to US taxpayer records. The acting head of the Social Security Administration recently resigned rather than give DOGE access to her agency‚Äôs reams of sensitive personal data.\nMore than half a dozen lawsuits are seeking to block DOGE employees from rifling through these vast troves of data. One thing they all have in common: They allege that DOGE‚Äôs actions violate the Privacy Act of 1974.\nHere‚Äôs how a law passed after Watergate could rein in another president whose self-professed zeal for retribution is unnerving constitutional experts.\nWhat Is the Privacy Act?\nThe Privacy Act is a law that limits how the federal government can collect, use, and share information about US citizens and other people in the United States.\nThe law‚Äôs core features include letting people access government records about them; letting people correct those records if they contain mistakes; requiring agencies to limit information collection, publish lists of records databases, and protect data from hackers; and restricting how agency employees and third parties can access records.\nThose restrictions on accessing data are at the heart of the ongoing DOGE saga.\nThe Privacy Act prohibits an agency from disclosing someone‚Äôs records‚Äîeven within the agency‚Äîunless that person approves in writing or the agency meets one of the law‚Äôs 12 exceptions. Most of the exceptions deal with fairly specific circumstances, such as congressional oversight, law enforcement investigations, court orders, census work, statistical research, and National Archives preservation. But there are also two broad, vague exceptions: Agencies can share records with their own employees who ‚Äúhave a need for the record in the performance of their duties‚Äù or with third parties for ‚Äúa routine use‚Äù (defined as one that is ‚Äúcompatible with the purpose for which [the data] was collected‚Äù).\nWhy Did Congress Pass the Privacy Act?\nPresident Richard Nixon illegally used the powers of the government to investigate, intimidate, and punish his political enemies. He tried to use the IRS to target liberal political groups with audits and scrutiny of their tax exemptions, and he deployed the FBI to spy on and harass his political opponents. After Nixon‚Äôs resignation over the Watergate scandal, lawmakers sought to prevent future presidents from weaponizing government power.\n‚ÄúCongress must act before sophisticated new systems of information gathering and retention are developed, and before they produce widespread abuses,‚Äù North Carolina Democratic senator Sam Ervin said as he introduced one of the bills that inspired the Privacy Act. ‚ÄúThe peculiarity of new complex technologies is that once they go into operation, it is too late to correct our mistakes or supply our oversight.‚Äù\nAfter months of congressional wrangling that saw the elimination of Ervin‚Äôs proposed independent privacy oversight board, President Gerald Ford signed the Privacy Act into law on December 31, 1974. Ford, who had chaired the Domestic Council Committee on the Right of Privacy that Nixon created during his final months in office, highlighted ‚Äúthe vital need to provide adequate and uniform privacy safeguards for the vast amounts of personal information collected, recorded, and used in our complex society.‚Äù\nHow Is This Relevant Today?\nDOGE‚Äôs critics‚Äîincluding Democratic lawmakers, federal employee unions, and government watchdog groups‚Äîargue that giving the office‚Äôs young, controversial, and seemingly largely unvetted staffers access to sensitive government data constitutes a major privacy breach. The incidents represent ‚Äúthe largest and most consequential breach of personal information in US history,‚Äù according to John Davisson, a lawyer for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, one of the groups suing to block DOGE‚Äôs access.\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, says DOGE employees need this data access to accomplish their mission of eliminating wasteful spending and shuttering programs that conflict with President Donald Trump‚Äôs agenda. After one federal judge temporarily blocked DOGE‚Äôs access to government payment systems, a White House spokesperson called the ruling ‚Äúabsurd and judicial overreach.‚Äù Musk targeted the judge on X, saying, ‚ÄúHe needs to be impeached NOW!‚Äù\nCan the Privacy Act Stop DOGE?\nIt will depend on whether multiple judges agree with the Trump administration‚Äôs arguments claiming the law doesn‚Äôt prevent DOGE staffers from accessing agencies‚Äô sensitive data.\nThe government contends that people can only sue agencies under the Privacy Act in one of four scenarios: when an agency refuses to grant someone access to a record about them; when an agency refuses to modify someone‚Äôs record as they requested; when an agency fails to keep someone‚Äôs record up to date and they experience concrete harm, such as a denial of benefits; or when an agency otherwise violates the law‚Äôs requirements in ways that adversely affect someone. It remains to be seen whether judges will determine that DOGE‚Äôs access to data adversely affects people.\nAgencies have also argued that they aren‚Äôt violating the Privacy Act because DOGE‚Äôs activities fall under the law‚Äôs ‚Äúroutine use‚Äù and ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù exceptions. In a court filing responding to one legal challenge, the Treasury Department said that DOGE personnel were accessing the data to identify potentially improper payments ‚Äúin furtherance of [their] duties‚Äù as directed by Trump (triggering the ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù exception) and that sharing this information with other agencies fell under one of the ‚Äúroutine uses‚Äù that the agency had previously disclosed as required by the Privacy Act.\nThe strength of that argument rests on how judges weigh two questions: whether the DOGE personnel accessing each agency‚Äôs data are employees of those agencies, and whether the two exceptions apply to the situations in which they accessed and shared the data.\nWho‚Äôs Using the Privacy Act to Sue DOGE?\nThere are at least eight lawsuits against the Trump administration over DOGE‚Äôs access to federal data, and all of them rely at least in part on the Privacy Act.\n- The American Federation of Government Employees, the Association of Administrative Law Judges, and more than 100 current and former federal workers are suing DOGE, Musk, and the Office of Personnel Management over what they claim is OPM‚Äôs illegal decision to give DOGE staffers access to a federal employee database, alleging that DOGE staffers ‚Äúlack a lawful and legitimate need for such access.‚Äù\n- The Electronic Privacy Information Center, on behalf of an unnamed federal worker, is suing OPM, DOGE, and the Department of the Treasury for allegedly giving DOGE access to OPM‚Äôs personal database and Treasury‚Äôs payment system ‚Äúfor purposes impermissible under the Privacy Act.‚Äù\n- The University of California Student Association is suing the Department of Education for allegedly turning over student data to DOGE staffers who are not, in the language of the Privacy Act, ‚Äúemployees who have a need for the records in the performance of their duties.‚Äù\n- Six government labor unions, two nonprofit groups, and the think tank Economic Policy Institute are suing the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and DOGE to prevent the office from accessing a wide range of data, including federal workers‚Äô wage-theft complaints and injury reports, for purposes allegedly ‚Äúinconsistent with the Privacy Act.‚Äù\n- Two government labor unions and the advocacy group Alliance for Retired Americans are suing Treasury for allegedly giving DOGE access to Americans‚Äô tax returns in alleged violation of both the Privacy Act and the Internal Revenue Service‚Äôs own special rules.\n- The National Treasury Employees Union is suing Acting CFPB director Russell Vought for giving information about CFPB employees to DOGE staffers, alleging their status as ‚Äúspecial government employees‚Äù places them outside the CFPB and thus outside the Privacy Act‚Äôs need-to-know exception.\n- Nineteen state attorneys general are suing Trump and Treasury over DOGE‚Äôs access to federal payment systems, arguing that because ‚Äúmany of the DOGE members given access to [the system] were not employees of Treasury,‚Äù that constitutes ‚Äúa violation of the Privacy Act.‚Äù\n- Six Americans are suing the Treasury and DOGE over what they describe as breaches of the sensitive personal data they gave the government while filing tax returns, applying for student loans, requesting disability payments, and receiving retirement benefits.\nWhere Do These Cases Stand?\nIn the state AGs case, a judge quickly issued a temporary restraining order restricting access to all Treasury systems storing sensitive personal and financial data. The case has since been assigned on a permanent basis to a different judge, who adjusted the order slightly after the Trump administration objected to its restrictions on political appointees. A status hearing took place on February 14.\nIn the EPIC case, the organization has asked the judge for a temporary restraining order blocking further DOGE access to certain Treasury and OPM systems. A status hearing will be held on February 21.\nIn the UC students case, the Department of Education is arguing, among other things, that the students haven‚Äôt shown any harm; that the Privacy Act only allows courts to pause agency actions in two situations not applicable here; and that the DOGE staffers are Education Department employees allowed to access the data. On February 17, a judge denied the students‚Äô motion for a temporary restraining order, saying they had not suffered ‚Äúirreparable injury.‚Äù\nIn the Labor, HHS, and CFPB case, the judge rejected the plaintiffs‚Äô request for a temporary restraining order, saying they failed to demonstrate the likely success of their arguments about the Privacy Act and other laws. But he also questioned whether DOGE staffers were employees of the agencies whose data they were accessing‚Äîa crucial question for a Privacy Act case.\nIn the Treasury case, the unions and ARA have asked for a temporary restraining order, but Treasury is making many of the same arguments as the Education Department, including that the Privacy Act can‚Äôt be used to pause DOGE staffers‚Äô access to data and invoking the need-to-know and routine-use exception. The judge in the case has temporarily limited access to Treasury‚Äôs payment system while weighing the plaintiffs‚Äô request for a restraining order. A hearing is scheduled for February 24.\nThe AFGE, NTEU, and class-action lawsuits haven‚Äôt proceeded beyond the filing of initial complaints.",

    "content_text": "President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have repeatedly affirmed Musk‚Äôs leadership of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But according to a new court filing from the White House, the administrator of DOGE isn‚Äôt Elon Musk after all. Who is? No one knows. The White House won‚Äôt tell the public, an administration lawyer has reportedly said he had no idea, and even people who work for the US DOGE Service can‚Äôt get a straight answer.\nOn Monday evening, Joshua Fisher, the director of the White House Office of Administration, claimed Musk wasn‚Äôt actually in charge of the so-called department he has championed for months. Fisher issued a sworn statement in a lawsuit brought by the state of New Mexico and 13 other Democratic attorneys general accusing Musk of exercising authority beyond the scope of his role. Rather than serving as the DOGE administrator or an employee of DOGE at all, Fisher said, Musk‚Äôs formal role is ‚Äúsenior advisor‚Äù to the president with ‚Äúno greater authority than other senior White House advisors.‚Äù This could make Musk‚Äôs authority and standing at USDS legally murky‚Äîespecially as a number of lawsuits embroil the organization‚Äôs activities.\nThe statement has also compounded confusion at USDS, formerly called the US Digital Service and rebranded as the US DOGE Service on January 20. Multiple legacy USDS employees tell WIRED they have no idea who the acting administrator is, despite requesting their identity multiple times.\nMusk announced that he would lead DOGE shortly after Trump won the presidential election last year and has spent the weeks since Trump took office championing DOGE‚Äôs work on X, the media platform that he owns, and spreading misinformation about the role and expenditures of numerous government agencies targeted by DOGE. In a recent Oval Office appearance, Trump referred to DOGE as Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúteam.‚Äù If Musk is not serving as the administrator, his leadership appears to be unofficial and in name only. But this would leave it unclear who the official administrator actually is‚Äîor whether the office is vacant.\nThis isn‚Äôt a trivial matter. The executive order establishing DOGE plainly states, ‚ÄúThere shall be a USDS Administrator established in the Executive Office of the President who shall report to the White House Chief of Staff.‚Äù It goes on to say that an organization called the U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization will be set up within the USDS, to be headed by the administrator and ‚Äúdedicated to advancing the President‚Äôs 18-month DOGE agenda.‚Äù\nAccording to Fisher‚Äôs statement, Musk has nothing to do with any of this.\n‚ÄúThe U.S. DOGE Service is a component of the Executive Office of the President. The U.S. DOGE service Temporary Organization is within the U.S. DOGE Service. Both are separate from the White House Office,‚Äù Fisher wrote in his statement. ‚ÄúMr. Musk is an employee in the White House Office.

    "content_text": "The National Science Foundation fired nearly 170 workers in a Zoom call on Tuesday morning as part of the Trump administration‚Äôs agenda to reduce the federal workforce. The terminated workers, who were told their employment would end at 5 pm EST today, included those still under probation, but also workers who had already completed the requisite one-year probationary period to become permanent workers and at-will workers who were considered permanent employees.\nEarlier this month, however, these permanent workers were suddenly told by NSF that their one-year probationary period should have been two years and they were no longer safe from being terminated.\nThe Trump administration has ordered federal agencies to fire nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained permanent status, thereby receiving civil service protections. But NSF workers who believed they were safe suddenly found themselves without jobs today.\nThe National Science Foundation is an independent agency within the federal government that provides grants to universities and other bodies in support of scientific and engineering research. The foundation‚Äôs grants account for about a quarter of all federal support to academic institutions for research. NSF‚Äôs grants were paused in late January due to a funding freeze, but the agency resumed issuing grants following a court order early this month.\nMany of the people terminated on Tuesday work as program managers and experts who make decisions about funding by aligning research proposals with the right program and matching those proposals to the most qualified reviewers to assess them and make recommendations.\n‚ÄúIt is hard to imagine this being accomplished successfully with automated algorithms,‚Äù one fired program manager told WIRED. ‚ÄúWith fewer program officers to steward the evaluation process, the overwhelming concern is that it will become harder to identify and support the transformative but unconventional projects that could otherwise be game changers in terms of advancing scientific progress in the USA.‚Äù\nAll sources who spoke with WIRED requested anonymity for fear of retribution.\nSources say 168 workers received an email at 9:02 am EST this morning requesting their presence at a 10 am Zoom call for a ‚ÄúMeeting with NSF probationary employees.‚Äù Many workers did not receive the Zoom link, however, and missed the start of the call. At the meeting, they were told that their network access would be shut out at 1 pm and they had until 5 pm to clear out their desks, though workers were told that accommodations would be made to obtain things they weren‚Äôt able to clear out by 5 pm.\nThe termination action this morning also included all permanent employees who were designated as ‚Äúat-will‚Äù workers. One terminated worker tells WIRED that they were a permanent federal employee working on a part-time basis, with an annual contract that was up for renewal in September.\nThe decision to terminate at-will employees came from NSF alone, not from the administration, NSF management told workers during the meeting. When asked whether at-will employees were just terminated out of fairness to the probationary workers, NSF management replied that the decision was ‚Äúpartly due to fairness, but that‚Äôs not all.‚Äù\nThe source says management then indicated that this was just the first step in subsequent termination rounds. The worker said they understood from this that the NSF believed at-will workers would be targeted in a subsequent round anyway, so they decided to terminate those workers now as well.\nThe fired program manager who spoke with WIRED came to NSF from academia on a temporary rotation position. Rotationary workers are those who work for a university but spend some of their time working for the NSF for a specific period. When a permanent position suddenly opened up during the worker‚Äôs rotation, NSF asked the worker to apply for it. They were hired in the summer of 2023 as a program manager, with a one-year trial period that ended in the summer of 2024. Paperwork that the worker shared with WIRED showed that the worker became a permanent employee at that time. But the worker says they and others were suddenly told recently that NSF had made a mistake.\nDuring the Tuesday Zoom call, the worker says, staff from NSF human resources seemed to indicate they had been caught off guard by the decision. ‚ÄúThey were watching their words carefully,‚Äù the worker says. ‚ÄúMy sense is that they were caught unawares and probably somebody pointed to some federal statute somewhere that made them rethink how they had been doing things in the past.‚Äù\nThe program manager says management and HR personnel told workers on the call that they believed the foundation had discretion to decide the probationary period but were recently told that the foundation did not have that discretion and that the probationary period should have been two years for all workers.\nNot everyone still on that probationary period got fired on Tuesday. The source tells WIRED that some workers who were very close to completing two years were not included in the terminations today. But workers were told that today‚Äôs action was just the first in what will be other termination actions at the foundation.\n‚ÄúThere were exceptions made for people who were very close to completing their two-year period,‚Äù the worker says.\nThe temporary rotation worker and other workers at NSF were told in January that they could accept the so-called fork-in-the-road resignation deal that would allow them to continue to draw a salary through September if they resigned their positions, but the worker says that because he had completed his probationary period he believed his job was safe. Once they were told that the probationary period was in question, he says, he had only a couple of days to decide about the buyout, but the union had advised workers to not take it. Now he says his life and the lives of other workers have been thrown into chaos.\nThe at-will worker says that during a question-and-answer portion of the Zoom call, several workers brought up the fact that federal agencies were supposed to condition the terminations based on merit, but this didn‚Äôt seem to be happening. Workers have been receiving termination letters from the Office of Personnel Management saying that the government has determined they or their position no longer has value to the government.\n‚ÄúThere were a number of employees who commented that they had nothing but exemplary performance reviews and director awards for meritorious services, so this notion that they were being let go [for poor performance] was ludicrous,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúThe answer was that they were simply copying the verbiage from OPM and that their value to the nation is no longer required.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "Argentina‚Äôs president, Javier Milei, has come under fire for the abrupt collapse of a cryptocurrency he promoted, in a move that has triggered lawsuits and calls for his impeachment.\nMilei is facing more than 100 complaints against him at the country‚Äôs supreme court, accusing him of participating in an alleged scam related to the cryptocurrency $Libra, which opposition politicians estimate has resulted in financial losses for 40,000 people.\nOn February 14, the Argentine leader posted a message on his X account, which has 3.8 million followers: \"Liberal Argentina grows! This private project will be dedicated to encourage the growth of Argentina's economy, funding small Argentine companies and ventures. The world wants to invest in Argentina. $Libra,\" he wrote.\nIn a matter of minutes, $Libra went from being worth fractions of a cent to $4.97 per unit. But unfortunately for investors, this hike was short-lived. Within hours it plummeted to $0.19.\nNow, prosecutors will determine if there are sufficient elements to move forward with a criminal investigation against the president and other possible suspects.\nMilei is accused of helping to inflate the price of the currency by promoting it on X, then withdrawing his support causing the cryptocurrency to collapse.\nFormer Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner claimed that Milei was a ‚Äúcrypto fraudster‚Äù in a lengthy post on X in which she also accused him of turning the country into a casino in which he was the croupier.\n‚ÄúThe president has to come to congress. He cannot investigate himself,‚Äù said politician Esteban Paulon, a member of the opposing socialist party, in a message on X calling for Milei‚Äôs impeachment.\nMilei has since distanced himself from this collapse, claiming he did not benefit from the memecoin.\n‚ÄúA few hours ago I posted a tweet, as I have done countless times before, about private initiatives that seek to contribute to the development of our country. I have no relationship with the company that created this cryptocurrency nor have I received any benefit.‚Äù In a statement on X, the official account for the office of the Argentinian president posted, ‚ÄúGiven the facts, President Javier Milei has decided to immediately involve the Anti-Corruption Office (OA) to determine whether there was improper conduct on the part of any member of the National Government, including the President himself.‚Äù\nEntrepreneur Hayden Mark Davis, one of the creators of the cryptocurrency $Libra, also blamed Milei for the collapse.\n‚ÄúHis team had secured his public support at launch and assured me that his support would continue throughout the process,‚Äù the American investor said in a statement released by his firm, Kelsier Ventures. ‚ÄúDespite prior commitments, Milei and his team unexpectedly reversed their position, withdrawing their support and removing all previous endorsements on social media,‚Äù Davis claimed, indicating that this setback would have triggered panic selling of the token.\n‚ÄúIt is critical to recognize that memecoin investments are driven by trust and endorsement. When Milei and his team removed their posts, investors who had purchased the token, basing their trust on that endorsement, felt betrayed.‚Äù\nDespite the allegations, Davis said in a video posted on X that Milei still has his support. He even introduced himself as ‚Äúhis adviser‚Äù and said that he will continue to collaborate on other tokenization projects in Argentina.\n\"My primary responsibility was to ensure that the token had sufficient volume, liquidity, and a solid treasury to support its price and execute the vision of the project,\" Davis said, by way of personal justification. ‚ÄúHowever, as an adviser, there were many factors beyond my control.‚Äù\nIn January, Milei wrote about a meeting he had with Davis, who allegedly \"advised him on the impact and applications of blockchain technology\" that could be expected in Argentina.\nFaced with this response, Davis, his alleged adviser, contradicted the head of Argentina's executive branch, assuring that prior assurances were not respected, and regretted Milei's actions. \"To my surprise, Milei later issued a statement indicating that his withdrawal was due to alleged misconduct on the part of the project's sponsors, calling them swindlers.\"\nDavis came out in defense of the other project partners, emphasizing ‚Äúthat Julian Peh, founder of KIP Network and lead sponsor of Libra Token, is completely innocent of any wrongdoing.‚Äù\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Espa√±ol and has been translated from Spanish.",

Learn more.\nIf you're running out of storage space on your laptop, or if you need to back up your data and store that backlog of videos you're going to edit one day (I am, I swear), an external hard drive can solve your problem. The trouble is, there are hundreds of drive options ranging from dirt cheap to crazy expensive‚Äîwhich one is right for your needs? I've tested dozens, across operating systems and with different use cases in mind, to find the best external hard drives for storage, backups, gaming, video editing, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, and more.\nCheck out our other guides, including How to Back Up and Move Your Photos Between Services, How to Back Up Your Digital Life, and How to Back Up Your iPhone.\nUpdated February 2025: We've added the Western Digital My Passport Ultra, LaCie's Rugged Pro5, and the Samsung EVO 990 bare drive.

Subscribe Today.\nHard Drive Buying Advice\nPicking the right hard drive comes down to balancing three things: speed, size, and price. If you're making nightly backups, then speed probably doesn't matter. Go for the cheapest drive you can find‚Äîup to a point. Drives don't last forever, but some last longer than others. I suggest sticking with known brands with a good reputation, like Seagate, Western Digital, Samsung, and the others featured here. This is based partly on experience and partly on the drive failure data that Backblaze has been publishing for years now. Backblaze goes through massive amounts of hard drives backing up customers' data, and its report is worth reading. The takeaway is simple: Stick with names you know.\nWhich Are the Most Reliable Brands of External Hard Drives?\nThis is difficult to answer, as it depends on too many factors. But if you go by Backblaze's stats report for 2023, the best drive makes are Toshiba, Seagate, Western Digital, and Hitachi (HGST in Backblaze's charts). The current best-performing drives appear to be Seagate's 6- and 8-TB SSDs. With that in mind, if I were building a network-attached storage (NAS) system, the Seagate Exos 8 TB HDD is what I would use. After that though, failures‚Äîespecially among SSDs‚Äîappear pretty random.\nWhich Is Better, SSD or HDD?\nIt depends on what you're doing. If you need fast data transfer speeds, then you want a solid-state drive (SSD). If you have massive amounts of data to store or back up, then a spinning drive (hybrid hard drive, or HDD) is the cheaper option. If you're a videographer, you need both‚Äîopen your wallet wide. In general, SSDs are the way to go when you can afford it.\nIf speed trumps price, then you want to look at the solid-state drives we've listed here. SSDs don't just have a speed advantage. They also lack moving parts, which means they'll withstand the bumps and falls of life in a bag on the road better than spinning drives. The disadvantage is that they can wear out faster. Every write operation to an SSD‚Äîthat is, when you save something to it‚Äîslightly degrades the individual NAND cells that make up the drive, which wears it out somewhat faster than a spinning drive. Just how much faster depends on how you use it. That said, I have several SSDs that are more than five years old, and I've used them for daily backups throughout that time. None of them have had any problems.\nDo you need an SSD over a spinning drive? The answer is almost always yes‚Äîif you can afford it. But they're especially useful for any drive you're working with regularly: your main boot drive, an external drive you use to edit documents from, and for backups, if you need them to happen fast.\nThe one caveat is that if your Mac or PC doesn't support the same USB standard as the external SSD you're considering, then you might be wasting your money. A drive claiming USB 3.0 speeds in the neighborhood of 2,000 MB/s will do you no good if all your laptop has is USB 2.0 ports. Be sure to check the specs for your laptop, and don't waste your money paying for transfer speeds you'll never see.\nWhich Backup Software Should You Use?\nThe answer depends on whether we‚Äôre talking about macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, or whatever Apple operating system you might be using now or in the future. Unfortunately, there is no one solution for everything. We suggest using one (or two) of the storage devices here and some kind of cloud storage backup as well. That way, even if your drives fail, your data is still backed up in the cloud. See our complete guide to backing up your digital life for our top-pick backup solutions for every platform.\nHow We Tested External Hard Drives\nI tested these drives by first running them through a suite of benchmarking tools. On Windows, I use CrystalDiskMark to measure both sequential read/write speeds and random read/write speeds. On macOS, I do the same with the Blackmagic Disk Speed Test and sometimes AmorphousDiskMark, and on Linux, I use KDiskMark (and I usually reformat the disk from exFAT to ext4). I run tests six times and then take the average. In addition to benchmarks, I have two folders for testing real-world speeds. I transfer a 25-gigabyte folder of MP3 files, and then a folder with three files that together are 25 gigabytes in size. For top end drives I also test read and write speeds for ProRes RAW video files.\nOnce I've run the tests, I use the drive in day-to-day tasks‚Äîediting files directly off it (booting from it in the case of bare drives), making nightly backups, tossing it in my camera bag, and so on. All these data points, along with price, form factor, portability, and other functionality (does it offer encryption, etc.), go into informing the decisions about which disk is best.\nBest for Backups\nFor incremental backups, which we recommend, speed isn't a huge factor. That's why the first drive I recommend is this Western Digital Elements hard drive. I have been using a variation of the Elements desktop hard drive to make incremental backups of my data for more than a decade now. These drives are big and require external power, but they're some of the cheapest, most reliable drives I've used.\nTransfer speeds are not off the charts‚Äîthe Elements drive I tested scored 120 megabytes per second (MB/s) for sequential writes on Windows‚Äîbut again, you should ideally be running backups overnight anyway, and even at these speeds the average PC backup will be done by morning. These drives use USB-C with support for USB 3, and I've had no problem using them with Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nStorage options go all the way up to 20 terabytes. Just check the prices; sometimes you can get a 10- or even 12-TB drive for not much more than the 8-terabyte version. And I have not seen a huge difference between the Elements line, the WD My Book drives, or the WD My Passport drives. The My Passport drives command a premium price because they're smaller, and the My Book drives have some encryption features that drive up the price, but I find the basic Elements drive is sufficient for most people.\n- Seagate Expansion 8-TB External Hard Drive for $159: Seagate is another reliable drive maker. It never hurts to have more backups, and if you do want multiple backups, use drives from different brands, since it will reduce the chance that both fail simultaneously.\nBest for Portable Backups\nIf you travel a lot, you'll want something that's easier to carry than the Elements drives, which aren't the best in a suitcase. For backups when traveling, I love Western Digital's My Passport series, especially the new ‚ÄúUltra‚Äù version, which uses a standard USB-C cord, eliminating the need to carry a separate cable. It's not the thinnest drive on the market, but it's less than an inch thick and solid enough that I never worried about tossing it in my bag. (Although it should be said that this is a spinning drive, so don't literally toss it.) I also like that the corners are nicely rounded and there are no screws or anything else that will catch on fabric in your bag.\nThere are a variety of colors available and you can get from 1 TB to 6 TB. I tested the 5-TB model, but Western Digital claims the same speeds regardless of drive size. I tested it using CrystalDiskMark on Windows, AmorphousDiskMark on macOS, and KDiskMark on Linux and averaged the results to come up with 121 MB/s for read speed and 115 MB/s write speed. It's not what you'd want to copy photos quickly for a client in the field, but fast enough to run a daily backup in your hotel room.\n- Western Digital Elements 5-TB Portable HDD for $115: This drive is slightly thinner than our top pick, but feels flimsier in my experience. Speeds are tad slower as well, but if you're on a budget this will save you a little cash.\nThe Best Drive for When Speed Is Everything\nLaCie has updated its rugged SSD line with the Rugged Pro5. This one ditches the iconic orange padding for blue, but it is otherwise just like the ordinary LaCie padded drives on the outside. On the inside, this is an amazingly fast drive. The 5 in the name is for, you guessed it, Thunderbolt 5, which despite being announced seemingly forever ago, has been painfully slow to trickle onto the market. This made testing a bit tricky, but fortunately a friend let me borrow his brand-new MacBook Pro 14 for testing. And the results were impressive.\nLaCie claims read/write speeds of up to 6,700 MB/s and 5,300 MB/s, which it says are enough for real-time editing of 8K and 6K RAW footage. In testing the highest speeds, file transfers were 5,787 MB/s read and 5,188 MB/s write‚Äîwhich, while not quite matching the claim, is still far and away the fastest drive on the page. But raw speeds are just numbers for spreadsheets; I was more interested in real-world performance. Since I happened to also be testing the Nikon Z6III (8/10, WIRED Recommends), which can shoot 6K ProRes RAW, I loaded a good bit of footage on the Pro5 and was indeed able to edit using DaVinci Resolve Studio.\nThe downside here is the price. At $600 for the 4-TB version (which is the minimum you'd want for working with ProRes RAW video files), this is a very pricey drive. It is however, well worth the money if it's speed you're after.\nBest Budget Portable SSD\nThese Crucial drives are my favorite general-purpose external storage drives. They're reasonably priced (for a portable SSD) and speedy enough for most uses. The X6 is lightweight and tiny, making it a good choice for working at the coffee shop.\nThis isn't a blinding-fast hard disk. In fact, under the hood, the X6 uses an older drive interface (Serial AT Attachment, or SATA), which was more common with spinning hard drives. So while it's small and light, its speed is limited by that older interface technology. In my testing on Windows and macOS, that works out to about 550 MB/s read speed and 208 MB/s write speed. That's good enough for backup and use as an external drive, but I don't recommend it for Xbox or PlayStation use. It does work fine with the iPad Pro though.\nThe major downside is the plastic construction‚Äîit‚Äôs a portable hard drive, not an indestructible hard drive. If you're worried about it breaking in your bag, grab a padded case. There are plenty out there, like this one. The Crucial X9 (below) is a step up from the X6, both in terms of build quality (it's metal to the X6's plastic) and speed, but the X9 is considerably more expensive.\n- Kingston XS1000 2-TB for $120: This tiny little drive is the smallest in this guide. Like the Crucial X6, it has a mostly plastic enclosure, but it has withstood life in my bag quite well. While it's not as robust as the padded options below, it's strong enough for most things. It's also speedy. Kingston claims up to 1,050 MB/s. I never managed that, but I routinely hit around 800 MB/s, with some older laptops closer to 600 MB/s, which is still quite good. The drive bogs down a bit with large files (MP4s, for example), so it's not the best for pro videographers, but for everyone else, this is a solid, slightly cheaper option.\nBest for Photographers\nCrucial's X9 Pro hits the sweet spot of speed, portability, and price to be one of the best drives out there for photographers looking to make backups in the field. These drives are tiny, about half the size of a deck of cards, and weigh a mere 1.3 ounces (38 grams). They'll connect to just about anything. I tested the X9 Pro on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS and never hit any issues with any of them. When it comes to speed, the X9 Pro claims symmetrical read and write speeds, at 1,050 MB/s. I actually consistently got higher speeds, up to 1,110 MB/s for read and 1,100 MB/s for write. That puts the X9 Pro at the top of the pack in terms of portable drive speed.\nI've been testing the X9 Pro for several months now, and while I can't yet speak to the long-term survival rate, I have been testing X6 and X8 drives from Crucial for over two years now without issue. There is also the X10 Pro drive ($180), which offers even faster speeds if you have a PC that supports USB 2X2. (The latest Intel chips support this spec, but Apple does not, so there's no point in buying the X10 Pro if you have a Mac.) I do not own a PC that supports USB 2X2 for extensive testing, but I did get a chance to at least try it, and the X10 Pro does indeed deliver on its promise of 2,100 MB/s (I got it up to 2,050 MB/s). If your hardware supports it, the X10 Pro is worth the extra money.\nBest Go-Anywhere Drive\nIf you need a drive that can stand up to life in a backpack or camera bag, get wet, or handle a drop onto hard surfaces, OWC drives are your best choice. It's tough to pick a winner here because there are many solid options, but OWC's Elektron drive narrowly beat others in benchmark tests. I also like that you can swap out the drive inside the aluminum casing (it's easy to unscrew), which means two years from now, you can pick up a faster bare SSD and drop it in the hardy Elektron enclosure.\n- Sabrent Rocket Nano 1-TB SSD for $120: I really like this one. It's smaller and slightly faster than the OWC, but it has two drawbacks. The first is that it can get hot. If you're trying to work with it in your lap, it can be downright uncomfortable. The other issue is that sometimes it's slow to be recognized by my PC. I could find no pattern to this; sometimes it appeared right away, and other times it took a couple of minutes. If those things don't bother you, this drive is tiny, cheaper, and includes a padded rubber case.\nBest Padded Drive\nThe go-anywhere drives above are a solid solution for people who need to make backups in the field, like photographers and videographers. But if you want an extra level of comfort, this padded drive from LaCie has long been a favorite of travelers. LaCie makes both an SSD version and a traditional spinning drive version. If speed isn't an issue, as with making nightly backups, then the cheaper spinning drive makes more sense. If you're backing up in the middle of a photo shoot or similar situation where backing up needs to happen fast, the SSD version is what you want.\n- Samsung T7 Shield 2-TB SSD for $149: It isn't as padded as LaCie's rugged drives, but it's cheaper and delivers nearly the same speed. It has an IP65 rating, which means it's fine in the rain and is protected from dust and sand. The T7 line is notable for its built-in security features like hardware-based encryption, but unlike the Touch model, the Shield does not have a fingerprint reader. Still, if you don't need the full padded protection of the LaCie and want to save a little money, the T7 Shield is a good option.\nBest Gaming Drive\nTake this category with a grain of salt. Most of the drives here will work just fine for gaming (just stick with the fastest you can afford). That said, Western Digital's new P40 does have some cool RGB lights on the bottom if that's your jam. In my testing, that didn't seem to impact power consumption.\nAs for speed, my tests were inconsistent. This drive is capable of speeds that handily beat both the Envoy Pro and Samsung T7, but at other times it seemed to bog down (at least in benchmarks). In real-world use, the bottleneck I consistently hit was some lag in transferring huge amounts of data. That might be a deal-breaker for some, but for the price, it remains a solid choice.\nBest Bare Drive\nIf you want to put a bigger SSD in your laptop, all you need is a bare drive, which is generally cheaper than the drives with enclosures listed above. The first thing to figure out is which drive your PC uses. Consult your manufacturer's documentation to find out. In my experience, the most common form factor is M.2 2280, which is the long, thin drive in the image above. More compact laptops may use the similar, but shorter, M.2 2242 design. Again, check your PC to confirm the drive it needs before you buy. There are a ton of these on the market, and I haven't had time to test many yet, but so far, out of the half dozen I have tried, Western Digital's WD Black series has stood out for speed, and it doesn't run very hot.\nThe SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 MB/s in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. I've been using it as my main drive for several months and found it fast enough for everything I do, including editing 5.2K video footage and compiling software. My favorite part? It generates very little heat. My older Dell XPS 13 used to get too hot to use without something between it and my lap. Now it doesn't get hot until I start trying to export video, but quickly cools off as soon as it's done.\n- Western Digital SN850X 2-TB SSD for $85: This drive is so screaming fast I had to run my tests twice because I didn't believe the first result. Western Digital claims up to 7,300 MB/s read speeds, and in benchmark tests, this drive's results came close. To take full advantage of the speed here, you'll need a system that supports the PCIe 4.0 SSD standard, but this is a great drive if you want to upgrade a gaming system, whether it's a desktop PC or your PlayStation. This drive is also one of the few I've seen that's available up to 8-TB capacity.\n- Samsung 990 Evo Plus 2-TB for $143: The 990 EVO Plus is an upgrade to the very popular 990 EVO. The original did not offer anything compelling and never made this guide, but the new version manages to be impressively speedy and not overly hot, as many Gen 5 PCIe disks I've tested have been. The 990 EVO Plus also launched with a 4-TB model, something missing the first time around. In terms of speed it doesn't quite match the SN850X above, topping out at 5,677 MB/s read, but it's plenty fast for most uses and remains quite cool even when pushed. If you're looking for a good all-around drive that stays cool, this one makes a good choice, though it is on the pricey side for what you get.",

external storage drives. They're reasonably priced (for a portable SSD) and speedy enough for most uses. The X6 is lightweight and tiny, making it a good choice for working at the coffee shop.</p><p class=\"paywall\">This isn't a blinding-fast hard disk. In fact, under the hood, the X6 uses an older drive interface (Serial AT Attachment, or <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SATA</a>), which was more common with spinning hard drives. So while it's small and light, its speed is limited by that older interface technology. In my testing on Windows and macOS, that works out to about 550 MB/s read speed and 208 MB/s write speed. That's good enough for backup and use as an external drive, but I don't recommend it for Xbox or PlayStation use. It does work fine with the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-ipad/\">iPad Pro</a> though.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The major downside is the plastic construction‚Äîit‚Äôs a portable hard drive, not an indestructible hard drive. If you're worried about it breaking in your bag, grab a padded case.

Like the Crucial X6, it has a mostly plastic enclosure, but it has withstood life in my bag quite well. While it's not as robust as the padded options below, it's strong enough for most things. It's also speedy. Kingston claims up to 1,050 MB/s. I never managed that, but I routinely hit around 800 MB/s, with some older laptops closer to 600 MB/s, which is still quite good. The drive bogs down a bit with large files (MP4s, for example), so it's not the best for pro videographers, but for everyone else, this is a solid, slightly cheaper option.</li></ul><p

and price to be one of the best drives out there for photographers looking to make backups in the field. These drives are tiny, about half the size of a deck of cards, and weigh a mere 1.3 ounces (38 grams). They'll connect to just about anything. I tested the X9 Pro on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS and never hit any issues with any of them. When it comes to speed, the X9 Pro claims symmetrical read and write speeds, at 1,050 MB/s.

(The latest Intel chips support this spec, but Apple does not, so there's no point in buying the X10 Pro if you have a Mac.) I do not own a PC that supports USB 2X2 for extensive testing, but I did get a chance to at least try it, and the X10 Pro does indeed deliver on its promise of 2,100 MB/s (I got it up to 2,050 MB/s).

handle a drop onto hard surfaces, OWC drives are your best choice. It's tough to pick a winner here because there are many solid options, but OWC's Elektron drive narrowly beat others in benchmark tests. I also like that you can swap out the drive inside the aluminum casing (it's easy to unscrew), which means two years from now, you can pick up a faster bare SSD and drop it in the hardy Elektron enclosure.</p><p aria-level=\"3\" class=\"paywall heading-h3\" role=\"heading\">Other Great Rugged SSDs</p><ul class=\"paywall\"><li><strong><a class=\"external-link\" data-aps-asc-tag=\"w050b-20\" data-aps-asin=\"B07ZWPH7G3\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2EvexLQGf2tBVT3UMMaJRgpxFKy5peL3MbjRinT3QRn516KGBjYqS17R28XiNwtvHZFhxMAbnfPE7QxW7BBRVsE5vpuELg9AzJKKDa8Uf9VKiGonoxupVdzQiGUPvB8z5Dgmi9r5TGj1kR9fdhd7YP2ggREcYmvG7PqCPcM7uR8uXXDHbakZ95LPUzzXbhRwwLKBpAwnhNspjuUSQvzJ49mZnLvUbB3KyXGyYvMDJ2AxuMcA6yA7AHqKfrAEfd7ThTmBeezXQ75VRi4vMR7Ze6JFzuqWcthC3DU9cZv7sJS2XkYC8ErBRbNS85cS19e4YzmtYyG5fWdPPu8hPMB6sXZBaTZB7oNtgM3K8zgrQrEH6NxUsdN2\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-Rocket-External-Aluminum-SB-1TB-NANO/dp/B07ZWPH7G3/?tag=w050b-20\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2EvexLQGf2tBVT3UMMaJRgpxFKy5peL3MbjRinT3QRn516KGBjYqS17R28XiNwtvHZFhxMAbnfPE7QxW7BBRVsE5vpuELg9AzJKKDa8Uf9VKiGonoxupVdzQiGUPvB8z5Dgmi9r5TGj1kR9fdhd7YP2ggREcYmvG7PqCPcM7uR8uXXDHbakZ95LPUzzXbhRwwLKBpAwnhNspjuUSQvzJ49mZnLvUbB3KyXGyYvMDJ2AxuMcA6yA7AHqKfrAEfd7ThTmBeezXQ75VRi4vMR7Ze6JFzuqWcthC3DU9cZv7sJS2XkYC8ErBRbNS85cS19e4YzmtYyG5fWdPPu8hPMB6sXZBaTZB7oNtgM3K8zgrQrEH6NxUsdN2\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Sabrent Rocket Nano 1-TB SSD for $120</a>:</strong> I really like this one. It's smaller and slightly faster than the OWC, but it has two drawbacks. The first is that it can get hot. If you're trying to work with it in your lap, it can be downright uncomfortable. The other issue is that sometimes it's slow to be recognized by my PC. I could find no pattern to this; sometimes it appeared right away, and other times it took a couple of minutes. If those things don't bother you, this drive is tiny, cheaper, and includes a padded rubber case.</li></ul><p id=\"five\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Best Padded Drive</h2></p><div

class=\"paywall\">Take this category with a grain of salt. Most of the drives here will work just fine for gaming (just stick with the fastest you can afford). That said, Western Digital's new P40 does have some cool RGB lights on the bottom if that's your jam. In my testing, that didn't seem to impact power consumption.</p><p class=\"paywall\">As for speed, my tests were inconsistent. This drive is capable of speeds that handily beat both the Envoy Pro and Samsung T7, but at other times it seemed to bog down (at least in benchmarks). In real-world use, the bottleneck I consistently hit was some lag in transferring huge amounts of data. That might be a deal-breaker for some, but for the price, it remains a solid choice.</p><p id=\"six\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Best Bare Drive</h2></p><div

is a bare drive, which is generally cheaper than the drives with enclosures listed above. The first thing to figure out is which drive your PC uses. Consult your manufacturer's documentation to find out. In my experience, the most common form factor is M.2 2280, which is the long, thin drive in the image above. More compact laptops may use the similar, but shorter, M.2 2242 design. Again, check your PC to confirm the drive it needs before you buy. There are a ton of these on the market, and I haven't had time to test many yet, but so far, out of the half dozen I have tried, Western Digital's WD Black series has stood out for speed, and it doesn't run very hot.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 MB/s in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. I've been using it as my main drive for several months and found it fast enough for everything I do, including editing 5.2K video footage and compiling software. My favorite part? It generates very little heat. My older Dell XPS 13 used to get too hot to use without something between it and my lap. Now it doesn't get hot until I start trying to export video, but quickly cools off as soon as it's done.</p><p aria-level=\"3\" class=\"paywall heading-h3\" role=\"heading\">Other Options</p><ul class=\"paywall\"><li><a class=\"external-link\" data-aps-asc-tag=\"w050b-20\" data-aps-asin=\"B0B7CKVCCV\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/5a1FMimJbzYezMeMToA4fa2KPpoGk6a3mjMwdfkBSx8vqeN5ZYTnYXCCPjYH6EcN1Byfudtbuz74PQFnPGuVdBtTa1guPypeFYt7dY6XSU57V7nt6b3rXUiHXguLpgTWMPU7m7TyJeRgxEYSiFX6BrKwYzFmchcYMwW2qjVKdqPGYFRaihkppk2uXmphxpi5rAgxLNmXgyj9ebJnY99Z5ZxTLU3rc3KVxYVYXSX7iFygZtjnYukevzqS8e1mbD3pNn3nSueSGGCEKHFXavjBFenSgvJ3ssaH6REtAbZgQ9TYNE2UatKEpPQWvE7LGSYCsz9eLa9WpVYXHDDKL3NsQTt\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN850X-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B0B7CKVCCV\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/5a1FMimJbzYezMeMToA4fa2KPpoGk6a3mjMwdfkBSx8vqeN5ZYTnYXCCPjYH6EcN1Byfudtbuz74PQFnPGuVdBtTa1guPypeFYt7dY6XSU57V7nt6b3rXUiHXguLpgTWMPU7m7TyJeRgxEYSiFX6BrKwYzFmchcYMwW2qjVKdqPGYFRaihkppk2uXmphxpi5rAgxLNmXgyj9ebJnY99Z5ZxTLU3rc3KVxYVYXSX7iFygZtjnYukevzqS8e1mbD3pNn3nSueSGGCEKHFXavjBFenSgvJ3ssaH6REtAbZgQ9TYNE2UatKEpPQWvE7LGSYCsz9eLa9WpVYXHDDKL3NsQTt\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Western Digital SN850X 2-TB SSD for $85</strong></a>: This drive is so screaming fast I had to run my tests twice because I didn't believe the first result.

The 990 EVO Plus also launched with a 4-TB model, something missing the first time around. In terms of speed it doesn't quite match the SN850X above, topping out at 5,677 MB/s read, but it's plenty fast for most uses and remains quite cool even when pushed.

    "content_text": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nWhile software makers and app developers continue to make their wares safer and less open to attack, you can never get complacent with digital security‚Äîand you need to be aware of all the different methods of attack that bad actors use to get at your accounts.\nThose methods include targeting Google Calendar: An app so basic and everyday, you might never think it could be used to channel malware in your direction. But with millions of users worldwide, and a reliable tech brand name behind it, Google Calendar is a platform hackers and scammers regularly take aim at.\nThe ways in which Google Calendar can be targeted vary, but there are some common themes across these types of attacks‚Äîand some general rules you can abide by to minimize your chances of being caught out.\nHow Google Calendar Malware Works\nThe majority of Google Calendar scams involve links to fraudulent websites designed to trick you out of personal details: The classic digital con. These links can either be embedded in Google Calendar event descriptions, or in emails purporting to be Google Calendar invites: In both cases, a lot of care will be taken to make the links appear normal and genuine.\nA standard Google Calendar invite comes with links to both the event itself and the list of guests‚Äîthe event is also included as an .ics file attachment to open in a calendar app. Events themselves, meanwhile, can come with links embedded in the description and files from Google Drive attached. All of these elements can be taken advantage of in some way by bad actors.\nTake the recent security vulnerability reported by Check Point as one example: The attack works by spoofing a genuine Google Calendar invite over email. Responding to the invite leads to a reCAPTCHA form or support button‚Äîand after that, the intended target is prompted to enter personal details on an official-looking site, details which can then be used to access other accounts or make unauthorized purchases.\nGoogle Calendar invites have been consistently used to try and dupe users, and if you're in an organization with a lot of meetings and appointments to keep track of, the dangerous ones can easily blend in with the authentic ones. On top of that, hackers may leverage information they have about your company or your contacts to make invites seem more plausible‚Äîfrom the names of executives to the addresses of offices.\nNot all attacks involve phishing links. While it was never exploited in the wild, a Remote Access Trojan attack was previously built as a proof of concept using code embedded in Google Calendar event descriptions to take control of a computer over the web. Google has since patched this particular vulnerability, but it shows the variety of attacks that are possible.\nHow to Protect Against Google Calendar Malware\nThankfully, Google isn't sitting back and accepting security vulnerabilities inside its calendar app: Google keeps it regularly updated with new protections against ‚Äúspam, phishing, and malware‚Äù in an attempt to stay ahead of new and evolving threats. As always, ensuring you keep your Google Calendar app and web browser up to date is one of the best ways to stay protected against the latest methods of attack.\nThe usual advice for avoiding phishing attempts and social engineering scams applies here too. Be wary of anything coming into your inbox with a link embedded, even if it seems to come from Google Calendar or someone in your contacts list‚Äîand be particularly suspicious of anything out of the ordinary (like a lunch date out of the blue from an ex-colleague who left the company the previous year).\nFollowing only invite links that you're expecting is a good general rule‚Äîyou can always check directly with the sender of the invite if you're not sure‚Äîand if you find a link leads you anywhere other than Google Calendar, don't go any further. Even if you think you are on Google Calendar, double-check the browser address bar to make sure.\nIn most email clients, you can dig deeper to check the origin of an email: In Gmail on the web, for example, click the three dots in the top-right corner of an email and Show original to see the full header information. This should include the full email address the invite has come from, and the sender field should read \"calendar-notification@google.com\" if it's an actual Google Calendar invite.\nMore generally, keeping your Google account protected with two-factor authentication is a must, as is regularly checking the apps and services connected up to your Google account: You can do this by heading to your Google account page on the web and from there choosing Security and See all connections. If there's anything here you no longer need, like a third-party calendar client, disconnect it.",

    "content_text": "‚ÄúKetamine is helpful for getting one out of the negative frame of mind,‚Äù Elon Musk told an interviewer last year. The unelected man currently gutting US federal programs isn‚Äôt the only one who thinks so. Ketamine, approved decades ago as a surgical anesthetic and long used as a party drug, is the off-label mental-health treatment of the moment. It induces a ‚Äútrancelike‚Äù state of ‚Äúsensory isolation,‚Äù researchers say, and may temporarily boost the brain‚Äôs neuroplasticity‚Äîwhich, in theory, makes mental ruts easier to escape. At the same time, ketamine abuse can be deadly, and the drug remains illegal to use without a prescription. (Musk says he has one from ‚Äúan actual, real doctor.‚Äù)\nWIRED spoke to the cofounders of an organization that offers ketamine-assisted leadership coaching in the San Francisco Bay Area. The two speakers are identified by pseudonyms, which they selected for themselves. Aria Stone has a doctorate in psychology. Shuang Shuang is a spiritual coach. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nShuang Shuang: We fast-track coaching by really locking it in with the psychedelics. We deliver it to you on a cellular level.\nAria Stone: With ketamine, there‚Äôs a 24- to 48-hour window of optimization, when people‚Äôs brains are literally more neuroplastic, which is why this is a multiday experience.\nSS: We call it an off-site, not a retreat, because we‚Äôre not retreating from anything. We don‚Äôt do them big‚Äînine or 10 clients‚Äîpartially due to the importance of confidentiality. Our clientele is primarily CEOs of Fortune 100 companies, CFOs, C-level founders of startups. All of them are in a pressure cooker.\nAS: Those are the kind of leaders that come‚Äîpeople who have achieved so much in their life, and they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúOK, what‚Äôs the next horizon? Because I‚Äôve checked pretty much every box.‚Äù\nSS: Here are all the loneliest people. They have to lead and go through so many things by themselves. They can come and see that they‚Äôre not alone, and let go of the burden of being so protected all the time. They just want to be people.\nTo screen clients, we ask about their medical and psychological background, whether they currently work with a therapist, and whether they‚Äôve participated in a group program before. We would slow down around accepting someone with a significant trauma history, someone who is actively suicidal or has a history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, the latter of which can be contraindicated with ketamine.\nAS: And since ketamine can certainly be misused, a history of substance abuse would also give us pause.\nSS: Our off-site costs $2,600 for three days, plus a $350 fee for a medical assessment and ketamine prescription. Meals are included, but transportation and lodging are not.\nAS: Over the course of a three-day off-site in the Mission, in a beautiful, open space with a tall ceiling, clients have two ketamine experiences. When you walk in, all of these BackJack floor chairs are in a circle. In the center are candles. We put a rose on every seat, and information about what to expect.\nSS: The vibes are witchy.\nThe first day is about settling into that radical acceptance, welcoming what‚Äôs coming to us on ketamine. Our opening ceremony could include movement, dancing, getting into the body, or we might just talk to each other about what‚Äôs alive for us. We have an intention-setting session.\nWe check with everybody to see if we have their consent, from every part of their body, to receive medicine. Then our medical doctor and registered nurse distribute the medicine through a shot‚Äîit‚Äôs all intramuscular.\nIf it‚Äôs your first time using ketamine and you‚Äôre nervous about it, thank God! That‚Äôs the way it should be. But there‚Äôs also the option to not do ketamine at all: You thought you wanted to do it, and then when push comes to shove, you‚Äôre on your journey mat and you‚Äôre just like, ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt want to do it.‚Äù\nKetamine and psychedelics are not a panacea. We know that it‚Äôs not for everyone. You don‚Äôt have to push yourself to do this new, innovative, cutting-edge type of therapy. Yes, there is great promise, and the data over and over again makes this area very frothy and enthusiastic. But it‚Äôs perfectly OK if you‚Äôre scared and anxious. Just listen to your body and heart.\nAS: When we transition into the journey, we pull the BackJacks out.\nSS: It‚Äôs pretty sweet. They have little nests, little beds. They‚Äôre all tucked in. They have blankets and pillows, and earplugs if the ambient music playing on the speakers gets too loud. They‚Äôre wearing eye masks, because ketamine is more of a dissociative medicine‚Äîthere is this sense of naturally going inward and being quiet. There are a bunch of stuffed animals there that some people take for their journey.\nAS: There‚Äôs this huge teddy bear holding a cup of the intramuscular ketamine.\nWe encourage clients to bring things that are meaningful for them‚Äîlike a journal, photos of loved ones, loved ones that have passed, rocks. It‚Äôs just really loving, grounding, and open.\nSS: It‚Äôs like an executive-coaching psychedelic slumber party.\nOn the first day we do a psycholytic dose of ketamine. It‚Äôs not exactly a psychedelic dose, but it lets you kind of just teeter onto the realms. The next day is a mid-dose. That day is all about medicine and integration, and there‚Äôs coaching around it.\nAS: Four of us facilitate the off-sites. While people are on their ketamine journey, we‚Äôre all very attentive. We‚Äôre in silent communication with each other. Collectively, we‚Äôre really holding this space, seeing what emerges. I mean, we‚Äôve seen over 100 ketamine journeys at this point.\nSS: In a supportive clinical setting, the chance of having a bad trip is severely diminished. Also, I hold the faith that there‚Äôs no such thing as a bad trip. Rather, there are challenging or uncomfortable journeys.\nLet‚Äôs say someone‚Äôs trauma comes through. One way that could show up is you are screaming, or a lot of energy is just ripping through your body. You‚Äôll get off your mat and you‚Äôll just want to run. You‚Äôll think you‚Äôre in a dangerous situation. The first thing we do is make sure you‚Äôre in a safe hold so that you feel cared for. We‚Äôll let you take your eye mask off. Some people need a handhold or would like to be walked around the room. All these things help bring you back to now.\nThe third day is all integration and coaching: ‚ÄúWhat does this mean for me? How did I feel? And how do I bring something positive from that journey into my everyday life?‚Äù\nAS: And about a week and a half after, we have a follow-up virtual integration session, focused on the application of what they‚Äôve learned to their leadership.\nSS: One person came in not being able to feel their body. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a head, and this is my meat sack,‚Äù basically is what they said. After the off-site, they were able to pinpoint, ‚ÄúActually, I feel like I can feel my chest. I can go to other places inside my body and be connected to it.‚Äù\nAS: People are floating away at the end. They‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this to end. Can I integrate this way of being into my life?‚Äù\n‚ÄîAs told to Elana Klein",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>SS:</strong> The vibes are witchy.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The first day is about settling into that radical acceptance, welcoming what‚Äôs coming to us on ketamine. Our opening ceremony could include movement, dancing, getting into the body, or we might just talk to each other about what‚Äôs alive for us. We have an intention-setting session.</p><p class=\"paywall\">We check with everybody to see if we have their consent, from every part of their body, to receive medicine. Then our medical doctor and registered nurse distribute the medicine through a shot‚Äîit‚Äôs all intramuscular.</p><p class=\"paywall\">If it‚Äôs your first time using ketamine and you‚Äôre nervous about it, thank God! That‚Äôs the way it should be. But there‚Äôs also the option to not do ketamine at all: You thought you wanted to do it, and then when push comes to shove, you‚Äôre on your journey mat and you‚Äôre just like, ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt want to do it.‚Äù</p><p class=\"paywall\">Ketamine and psychedelics are not a panacea. We know that it‚Äôs not for everyone. You don‚Äôt have to push yourself to do this new, innovative, cutting-edge type of therapy. Yes, there is great promise, and the data over and over again makes this area very frothy and enthusiastic. But it‚Äôs perfectly OK if you‚Äôre scared and anxious. Just listen to your body and heart.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>AS:</strong> When we transition into the journey, we pull the BackJacks out.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>SS:</strong> It‚Äôs pretty sweet. They have little nests, little beds. They‚Äôre all tucked in. They have blankets and pillows, and earplugs if the ambient music playing on the speakers gets too loud. They‚Äôre wearing eye masks, because ketamine is more of a dissociative medicine‚Äîthere is this sense of naturally going inward and being quiet. There are a bunch of stuffed animals there that some people take for their journey.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>AS:</strong> There‚Äôs this huge teddy bear holding a cup of the intramuscular ketamine.</p><p class=\"paywall\">We encourage clients to bring things that are meaningful for them‚Äîlike a journal, photos of loved ones, loved ones that have passed, rocks. It‚Äôs just really loving, grounding, and open.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>SS:</strong>¬† It‚Äôs like an executive-coaching psychedelic slumber party.</p><p class=\"paywall\">On the first day we do a psycholytic dose of ketamine. It‚Äôs not exactly a psychedelic dose, but it lets you kind of just teeter onto the realms. The next day is a mid-dose. That day is all about medicine and integration, and there‚Äôs coaching around it.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>AS:</strong> Four of us facilitate the off-sites. While people are on their ketamine journey, we‚Äôre all very attentive. We‚Äôre in silent communication with each other. Collectively, we‚Äôre really holding this space, seeing what emerges. I mean, we‚Äôve seen over 100 ketamine journeys at this point.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>SS:</strong> In a supportive clinical setting, the chance of having a bad trip is severely diminished. Also, I hold the faith that there‚Äôs no such thing as a bad trip. Rather, there are challenging or uncomfortable journeys.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "In the eastern Pacific Ocean, mobulas alternate between silent undulation underwater and acrobatic leaps out of it. These magnificent rays are at risk of disappearing due to targeted fishing, being caught as bycatch, and climate change. Scientists at the research collaboration Mobula Conservation are teaming up with artisanal and industrial fishermen to protect them.\nAlso known as ‚Äúdevil rays,‚Äù mobulas are elasmobranchs: a subclass of fish‚Äîincluding sharks, skates, and sawfish‚Äîthat are distinguished by having skeletons primarily made from cartilage. More than a third of the species in this group are threatened with extinction. Of the nine species of mobulas, seven are endangered and two are vulnerable according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nResearchers Marta Palacios, Melissa Cronin, and Nerea Lezama-Ochoa founded Mobula Conservation in 2020 with support from the international charity organization the Manta Trust. ‚ÄúWe do science for action, everything contains a conservation objective,‚Äù says Palacios. The marine biologists met years ago on El Pardito Island, in the Gulf of California, whose waters are home to five mobula species. The smallest, Mobula munkiana, has a 1.10-meter wingspan; the largest, Mobula birostris, reaches 7 meters across with its fins extended.\nThe scientists at Mobula Conservation do everything they can to protect these rays: implanting acoustic transmitters and flying drones over their groups to trace their movements, chasing them to film them underwater, sailing at night to record the impact of fishing bycatch, or uncovering the black market for mobula meat and parts around the world. Lezama has worked for years modeling the critical habitats of mobulas in the Pacific Ocean, and Cronin collaborates with geneticists at the University of California, Santa Cruz to uncover the dynamics of their populations.\nA recent study led by Palacios revealed that mobulas are caught in 43 countries and consumed in 35. In Latin America, the rays are fished for food, while in African and Asian countries the demand is for their meat and gill plates because of their popularity in the Asian medicinal market. Tonics made from mobulas are said to treat multiple ailments, although there‚Äôs no scientific evidence to support their efficacy.\nEven when mobulas are not targeted, they can end up in fishing nets as bycatch. Instances of up to 200 rays being caught in a single net have been reported. Between 1993 and 2014, more than 58,000 mobulas were reported caught in the eastern Pacific across the five species that inhabit the region. About 13,000 individuals are caught as bycatch each year by the tuna industry.\nIt‚Äôs not known how many mobulas ply the seas, but landings of them suggest severe and rapid declines across species and in various regions. To better understand the situation, Cronin and Lezama study industrial fishing in Ecuador, while Palacios focuses on artisanal fisheries in the Gulf of California. All of these researchers are seeking to unravel the life histories of these animals and to involve fishermen in their conservation.\nFrom Research to Action\nFor 11 years, Palacios has made the Baja California Sur desert her home and mobulas her cause. In 2014, while sailing the Gulf of California, she came across Mobula munkiana for the first time. During five days at sea, hundreds of the rays jumped alongside her boat. ‚ÄúThey were everywhere, jumping all over the place, and no one knew what they were doing or where they were going,‚Äù she recalls. The lack of answers ignited the Spanish biologist‚Äôs curiosity.\nMobula munkiana can form massive aggregations in the sea, with thousands of individuals sometimes grouping together across hundreds of kilometers of ocean. These rays can be found in the eastern Pacific, from Peru to Mexico, where they are nicknamed ‚Äútortillas‚Äù because of the sound they make when they return to the sea after jumping out of the water, which is similar to making tortillas by hand.\nThese rays are not the only elasmobranchs that jumps out of the water. Many species do so to remove parasites, clean their gills, or as part of courtship. However, while sharks and manta rays jump alone, M. munkiana jump in groups. They jump year-round, regardless of whether they are newborns, adults, females, or males. ‚ÄúIt probably has different functions within their communication, but we don‚Äôt understand what they are communicating,‚Äù Palacios explains.\nIn coastal areas, aggregating can be a death sentence for these rays if they coincide with artisanal tuna fisheries that use gillnets and purse seines. And if that were not enough of an existential risk, their biology also conspires against them too: their reproduction rate is slow. Depending on the species, it takes between five and 10 years for mobulas to acquire the capacity to reproduce, and they have long gestation periods of more than 12 months, producing only one offspring at a time. They can go between two and seven years between pregnancies.\nFurthermore, in the Tropical Eastern Pacific, 23 percent of the 132 species of chondrichthyans‚Äîthe class to which elasmobranchs belong‚Äîhave been found to be highly vulnerable to climate change; the worst affected are species that use the coasts as nurseries, such as M. munkiana. Sea warming encourages ocean waters to separate into layers of different densities, a process known as stratification, which makes it difficult for cold, nutrient-rich bottom water to rise to the top of the sea, which can affect food production.\nYears ago, on the Gulf of California, Palacios began implanting small acoustic devices in rays that transform them into data messengers. Fishermen, hired for the task, capture the animals and then return them to the water. This strategy is known as passive acoustic telemetry, and although seemingly invasive, is carried out with extreme care. Once released, the animals resume their swim.\nEach time a tagged animal passes near an underwater receiver, the date and duration of its visit is recorded. With this data, in 2021 Palacios was able to describe for the first time a breeding area of M. munkiana in a bay in the Gulf of California. To further reconstruct the life history of these creatures, the scientist collects testimonies from fishermen and observes their monumental groups using drones.\nPalacios sleeps little these days. She spends her nights watching the fishermen of bottom-spotted stingrays, a commercial and legally fished species in Mexico, as they cast their nets into the sea. In those nets, mobulas are caught incidentally. One experiment of hers consisted of more than 40 nights documenting the situation and assessing whether the use of lighter nets could reduce bycatch.\nA Lack of Strict Protection\nBecause of their supposed medicinal properties, the meat and gill plates of mobulas are increasingly in demand in Asia. Palacios recently led a study to try to understand the magnitude of the problem, which involved 100 surveys and interviews in 19 countries. The research team analyzed data from 75 nations, including photos and records of seizures in Palestine, Somalia, Vietnam, and Hong Kong.\nThe study revealed that meat is exported from countries such as Bangladesh (to mainland China, India, and Myanmar), Ecuador (to Peru), India, Madagascar, Madagascar, Mauritania, Myanmar (to Thailand), Oman (to United Arab Emirates), Senegal, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. The highest prices for dried meat‚Äîup to $10/kg‚Äîwere found in Bangladesh and Myanmar, while fresh meat reached $8/kg in Benin, Mexico, Brazil, and the Republic of Congo, with M. mobular and M. alfredi being the most hunted species.\nGill plates are harvested in 14 countries across Africa and Asia, and are imported mainly to mainland China and Hong Kong, where a kilogram can cost $1,260. They also reach Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand.\nThe researchers also found that although international mobula trade involves 20 countries, only five reported it to CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Since 2013, CITES has allowed regulated trade of mobulas in an effort to prevent their extinction, but trafficking of these animals‚Äô meat and parts has not decreased. Some researchers therefore recommend moving to a full prohibition of trade.\nHabitat care is also weak. UN biodiversity targets have called for nations to designate 30 percent of their waters as marine protected areas (MPAs) by 2030. While MPAs have increased dramatically in size over the past 15 years, currently only 16 percent of marine habitats critical to sharks and rays fall inside an MPA, and only 7 percent of these habitats are ‚Äúno take‚Äù zones, where fishing is completely banned.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Espa√±ol and has been translated from Spanish.\nUpdated 2-20-2025 12:30 pm GMT: Marta Palacios was erroneously identified as a man in a previous version of this piece.",

    "content_text": "Last spring, Austin Federa was eyeing up a new property in Brooklyn, New York. After passing an initial round of vetting for a mortgage with HSBC, he put in an offer, eager to avoid getting beaten to the punch. But then the bank began to ask about his job.\nFedera worked as head of strategy at the Solana Foundation, a nonprofit in the cryptocurrency industry, he told HSBC. That didn‚Äôt go down well: After repeated delays and back-and-forth, the bank said it would grant the mortgage only if Federa left his job, he claims.\nFedera was dumbstruck: ‚ÄúThe guy explicitly told me: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs because of crypto,‚Äô‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHow could I be a more attractive person to lend to as someone who is unemployed?‚Äù HSBC did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn crypto circles, tales of difficulties in securing loans, banking, and other ordinary financial services in the US are common. Multiple firms report being stonewalled by tens of different banks before finding one willing to provide a checking account; others say banks have closed their accounts at short notice, sometimes without giving a reason.\nThat‚Äôs a major problem: Without a banking partner, crypto firms cannot accept dollars in exchange for services, store funds raised from investors, nor pay employees or vendors. Their quest to build a peer-to-peer financial system free of rent-seeking intermediaries is dependent, inconveniently, on an accord with those same intermediaries‚Äîthe banks.\nLarge US banks have been reluctant to do business with crypto firms for many years; in 2017, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon described bitcoin as ‚Äúfraud.‚Äù But during the Joe Biden administration, members of the industry‚Äîwith crypto venture capitalist Nic Carter leading the chorus‚Äîbegan to cry conspiracy. The federal government was deliberately trying to destroy crypto businesses by surreptitiously cutting them out of the banking system, they claimed.\nIn the end, Federa managed to secure a mortgage with Citizens Bank, which he had been speaking to at the same time as HSBC. Though his friends were sympathetic, they were largely skeptical of the idea of a conspiracy to debank crypto. ‚ÄúThey thought it must have been an anomaly,‚Äù says Federa.\nHowever, under the Donald Trump administration, the debanking allegations are being taken seriously by Congress. In early February, both the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Banking Committee held separate hearings on the topic, at which crypto executives testified. The hearings mark the start of an inquiry into Operation Chokepoint 2.0, the term widely used to describe the alleged anti-crypto conspiracy, coined by Carter.\n‚ÄúConsider what happens when a bank refuses to provide services to your company at the direction of a bank regulator,‚Äù said Republican congressman French Hill, chair of the House Committee on Financial Services, at one of the hearings. ‚ÄúThat is exactly what was happening under the Biden and Harris policy of Chokepoint 2.0, which nearly severed the digital asset ecosystem from financial institutions,‚Äù he alleged.\nThe term Operation Chokepoint was first used in reference to a program launched by the Barack Obama administration under which US officials were said to have pressured banks into severing ties with pornography, payday lending, and other disfavored industries. This time, the argument goes, crypto was in the crosshairs.\nSpecifically, the theory is that the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the agencies responsible for the stability of the US banking system, strong-armed banks into refusing to serve the crypto industry. They did so by issuing informal guidance, skirting the public consultation process required to instate formal policy, crypto figures have claimed.\nIn a joint statement issued in January 2023, in the wake of the spectacular collapse of crypto exchange FTX and various other crypto businesses, the three agencies claimed that crypto represented a ‚Äúsignificant risk‚Äù for banks. ‚ÄúIt is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled do not migrate to the banking system,‚Äù the agencies wrote, although they also made clear that US banks are ‚Äúneither prohibited nor discouraged‚Äù from servicing crypto businesses. In additional statements issued around that time, both the banking regulators and White House further warned banks to limit their exposure to crypto.\nIn a statement to WIRED, Rodney Hood, acting comptroller of the currency said, ‚ÄúThe OCC does not direct banks to open, close, or maintain individual accounts. Nor does the OCC recommend or encourage banks to engage in the wholesale termination of categories of customer accounts.‚Äù\nThe Federal Reserve declined to comment but pointed to statements made by its chairman, Jerome Powell, at a January press conference: ‚ÄúBanks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers, as long as they understand and can manage the risks,‚Äù he said at the time. ‚ÄúWe certainly don‚Äôt want to take actions that would cause banks to terminate customers who are perfectly legal.‚Äù\nThe FDIC did not respond to a request for comment.\nPreviously, crypto entrepreneurs have been reluctant to go public with tales of their debanking, partly to avoid being stigmatized and partly for fear of jeopardizing their new banking relationships, says Nick Neuman, CEO at crypto custody firm Casa. In 2021, Silicon Valley Bank informed Casa that it would close its bank account, which the company had held for three years. Neuman‚Äôs cofounder wanted to tweet about it, but he objected.\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worried that if you talk about this publicly you‚Äôre going to flag yourself to the current banking relationship that you barely got by the skin of your teeth, then they are going to debank you too. You‚Äôre back to square zero,‚Äù says Neuman. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in this mode where you‚Äôre hoping that nobody in the bank‚Äôs risk committee realizes that you‚Äôre a crypto business. You want to stay under the radar.‚Äù\nNow that Donald Trump has assumed the White House, having vowed on the campaign trail to ‚Äúimmediately shut down Operation Chokepoint 2.0,‚Äù members of the industry feel emboldened. After the issue was mentioned by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen on the Joe Rogan podcast in December, they flooded X with war stories about their dealings with banks. ‚ÄúThe tide had turned, and the new administration was clearly coming in and changing things,‚Äù says Neuman.\nFew would now dispute that crypto businesses had trouble accessing financial services in the US‚Äîthe anecdotes are too many. But it remains for Congress to firmly establish why. While Trump and other politicians have spoken in terms that imply the Operation Chokepoint 2.0 theory has been proven categorically, no smoking gun‚Äîwhether documentary evidence or insider testimony‚Äîhas yet emerged.\nAt the hearing held by the House Committee on Financial Services on February 6, the discussion returned repeatedly to 700 pages of documents released by the FDIC, partly in response to a request filed under the Freedom of Information Act by the crypto exchange Coinbase. The documents chronicle the FDIC‚Äôs communications with banks about crypto during the Biden presidency.\nThe document payload contains letters in which the FDIC directed banks to pause plans to provide various crypto-related services to clients. In other examples, the regulator posed long lists of questions to banks about their crypto activities.\nThere is no explicit instruction for banks to withhold or withdraw accounts from crypto businesses in the documents, but industry executives have argued that the impression given to banks of a general suspicion toward crypto at the FDIC had the same practical effect.\n‚ÄúThe pause letters show that, over and over again, banks were subject not to regulation by examination but regulation by exhaustion,‚Äù said Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, in his testimony. ‚ÄúYou had question after question raised.‚Äù\nThe perceived implication that the FDIC was likely to subject crypto-curious banks to heightened scrutiny was sufficient for financial institutions to decide that the hassle of working with crypto businesses was not worth the revenue they would bring in, others have claimed.\n‚ÄúThese efforts make it uneconomic to serve the crypto industry. While there is no legal ban, there is a functional ban,‚Äù argued Austin Campbell, an adjunct professor at NYU Stern School of Business and CEO at the crypto payments company WSPN, in his testimony.\nAt a separate hearing held by the same congressional committee on February 12, proponents of the Operation Chokepoint 2.0 theory received the closest thing yet to confirmation of discrimination faced by crypto businesses, claims Caitlin Long, CEO at Custodia, a crypto-focused bank in an ongoing licensing dispute with the Federal Reserve.\n‚ÄúWe are all struck at the number of complaints and the breadth of them ‚Ä¶ We are not telling banks that they can‚Äôt bank certain people or anything like that. But nonetheless we are hearing [that crypto companies are being refused bank accounts],‚Äù said Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in his testimony. ‚ÄúI take at least some of it as real. We need to understand it and stop it from happening.‚Äù\nHowever, not everyone believes that conspiracy is the most likely explanation for the caution or aversion toward crypto among banks.\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that there was any conspiracy,‚Äù says Mercedes Tunstall, a partner at the law firm Cadwalader, formerly an in-house lawyer at the Bank of America and HSBC. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a real concern about money laundering, fraud, and terrorist financing occurring with cryptocurrency.‚Äù\nAfter FTX collapsed amid allegations of fraud, says Tunstall, the banks had particular reason for limiting the number of crypto clients they worked with: Both to protect themselves from the reputational risk associated with providing services to a company later revealed to be fraudulent and the operational risk tied to the possibility that other crypto businesses might become casualties in the FTX fallout.\n‚ÄúThe banking industry is very gossipy,‚Äù says Tunstall. ‚ÄúI think there was maybe a crowd mentality driving [the unwillingness to work with crypto businesses] but not anything more nefarious than that.‚Äù\nNevertheless, crypto figures are using this opportunity to call for various reforms. During the hearing held by the House Committee on Financial Services, Campbell recommended that banks be required to provide a written justification to any client whose account they intend to close, and that banking regulators should be permitted to deliver guidance only in writing, never verbally.\nOthers are baying for Congress to name the individuals involved in the alleged Operation Chokepoint 2.0 plot. ‚ÄúThe truth is going to come out,‚Äù Long told WIRED in an interview late last year. ‚ÄúIf they follow through [with the investigation,] a lot of faceless bureaucrats‚Äô names will be out there.‚Äù\nBut irrespective of whether Congress unearths a genuine conspiracy, the very existence of an investigation is already making a difference, Federa claims.\nIn November, Federa left the Solana Foundation to launch DoubleZero, a new crypto venture incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Initially, the organization was turned away by a range of US banks. But two of those banks have since agreed to supply DoubleZero with an account, Federa claims, after a sudden change in policy.\n‚ÄúThe last thing anyone building a company wants to worry about is banking. But for years there was no other option,‚Äù says Federa. ‚ÄúSomething has changed‚Äîand that change is good. If the political process wants to assign repercussions, Godspeed. But hopefully this is something I never have to think about again.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) project had uncovered massive government fraud when it alleged that 150-year-olds were claiming Social Security benefits.\nBut Musk has provided no evidence to back up his claims, and experts quickly pointed out that this is very likely just a quirk of the decades-old coding language that underpins the government payment systems.\nMusk first made the claims during his Oval Office press conference last week, when he claimed that a ‚Äúcursory examination of Social Security, and we got people in there that are 150 years old. Now, do you know anyone that's 150? I don't know. They should be in the Guinness Book of World Records ‚Ä¶ So that's a case where I think they're probably dead.‚Äù\nWhile no evidence was produced to back up this claim, it was picked up by right-wing commentators online, primarily on Musk‚Äôs own X platform, as well as being reported credibly by pro-Trump media outlets.\nComputer programmers quickly claimed that the 150 figure was not evidence of fraud but rather the result of a weird quirk of the Social Security Administration‚Äôs benefits system, which was largely written in COBOL, a 60-year-old programming language that undergirds SSA‚Äôs databases as well as systems from many other US government agencies.\nCOBOL is rarely used today, and as such, Musk‚Äôs cadre of young engineers may well be unfamiliar with it.\nBecause COBOL does not have a date type, some implementations rely instead on a system whereby all dates are coded to a reference point. The most commonly used is May 20, 1875, as this was the date of an international standards-setting conference held in Paris, known as the Convention du M√®tre.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former employee of the Social Security Administration with insight into what's happening? We‚Äôd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact David Gilbert at david.gilbert@wired.com or securely on Signal on DavidGilbert.01.\nThese systems default to the reference point when a birth date is missing or incomplete, meaning all of those entries in 2025 would show an age of 150.\nThat‚Äôs just one possible explanation for what DOGE allegedly found. Musk could also have simply looked up the SSA‚Äôs own website, which explains that since September 2015 the agency has automatically stopped benefit payments when anyone reaches the age of 115.\nHowever, on Monday morning Musk doubled down, posting a screenshot of what he claims were figures from ‚Äúthe Social Security database‚Äù to X, writing that ‚Äúthe numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to FALSE!‚Äù\nThe figures suggested that over 10 millions people aged over 120 were collecting benefits.\n‚ÄúMaybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security,‚Äù Musk wrote.\nThe database Musk took the screenshot from listed almost 400 million people, which is more than five times the number of people receiving benefits in 2024, according to the SSA‚Äôs own website. It‚Äôs also significantly more than the entire US population.\nThe fact that the Social Security system contains millions of entries from people who are dead is likely distinct from a potential COBOL-caused error, and also not news. A report written by the SSA‚Äôs inspector general in 2023 found that 98 percent of those aged 100 or older in the Social Security databases are not in receipt of any benefits. The report added that the database would not be updated because it would cost too much money to do so.\n‚ÄúDOGE going into all these agencies with largely unfettered access with a wrecking ball and no understanding of the business logic and structure behind the code, database, and configured business logic, related payment systems, and integrated decision trees, poses real risks to the privacy and persona-level data of millions of people across all of those records,‚Äù Thomas Drake, a former National Security Agency executive-turned-whistleblower, tells WIRED.\nMusk, during the Oval Office press conference which was attended by his son, claimed the payments to 150-year-olds was part of the billions, maybe even tens of billions, in corruption and waste that his DOGE effort had already uncovered.\nBut just like condom shipments to Gaza or payments to Politico, Musk‚Äôs claims of Social Security fraud seems to be a gross misrepresentation of what‚Äôs actually happening and why.\nIn the same press conference where he made the remarks about 150-year-olds collecting Social Security benefits, Musk said his DOGE project would be ‚Äúmaximally transparent‚Äù with all savings being made posted to its website.\nBut when the site came online last week, not only was it just a repurposed Twitter feed with terrible security, it also lacked any details in a section dedicated to savings.\nAt the time, the site‚Äôs administrators claimed the savings section would be updated no later than Valentine‚Äôs Day. When that deadline came and went without any update, the administrator wrote: ‚ÄúReceipts coming over the weekend!‚Äù The page was briefly populated on Saturday before being taken down; at the time of publication on Monday, no receipts were posted.\n‚ÄúI do worry about bait-and-switch and further transfers of wealth and even more debt financing into the hands of even fewer, driven and riven by power and abject self-interest, not public interest,‚Äù Drake believes. ‚ÄúDemocracy is in real danger.‚Äù\nNeither DOGE nor the White House responded to requests for comment about Musk‚Äôs claims.",

    "content_text": "The Best Theraguns and Therabody Tools for Recovery\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nTheraguns are the gold standard for massage guns, so much so that the name has become synonymous with the category. But Therabody, the innovative company behind Theragun, has expanded its repertoire to boost wellness for more than just sore muscles. It now offers a suite of gadgets to alleviate eye strain, soothe menstrual cramps, and depuff your skin (to name a few). We haven't tried every product in their lineup‚Äîwe're getting there‚Äîbut we've put several to the test, and these are our favorites.\nWhile Theraguns are an excellent investment for active individuals, it's worth noting that percussive massage guns are available at lower price points. If you're not married to the brand, see our Theragun Alternatives guide for more recommendations that won't break the bank. But if you do opt for a Theragun, you can purchase a range of accessories and foam tips separately. You don't need to commit to the high-end Theragun Pro for high-quality relief. Just remember to double-check compatibility with your model.\nFor similar recommendations, read our Best Massagers, Best Leggings, and Top Fitness Apps guides.\nUpdated February 2025: We added the TheraFace Depuffing Wand, the JetBoots Prime, and the SmartGoggles (2nd Generation). We also moved the PowerDot 2.0 Duo to Honorable Mentions.\n|Next Up\n|I'll be testing the RecoveryTherm Back, a heat and vibration therapy wearable for $249, and the RecoveryTherm Cube, a heat, cold, and contrast therapy portable device for $159.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nHonorable Mentions\nPowerDot 2.0 Duo for $349: The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator uses neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to ease muscle pain, spasms, and even period cramps. You simply attach a reusable pad (or pads) to the sore muscle, and the device connects magnetically to the pad. The accompanying app gives you the power to control the intensity or select a specific session tailored to your needs. The key is to start low and gradually increase the intensity based on your tolerance. During my first two days of severe period cramps, I found that the PowerDot provided temporary relief. If you‚Äôre looking to treat multiple or larger areas (like your abdomen), I would recommend the Duo version. My beef with this device is that it tends to disconnect mid-session.\nTheraFace SleepMask for $99: I‚Äôve tested a couple of sleep masks, and the TheraFace SleepMask is one of my favorites. It vibrates with three patterns designed to nudge your brain into deeper rest. The contoured padding feels plush, and the adjustable strap keeps the mask in place and doesn‚Äôt tug at my hair, even when I shift around at night. I struggle with staying asleep, but when I wake up in the middle of the night, I just tap the button to start a session, and it usually puts me back to sleep. That said, the vibrations are almost too subtle, you barely feel them. You will notice the mask is pretty audible and not as soothing as a white noise machine, so if you‚Äôre a light sleeper, this might be a dealbreaker.\nTheraFace Pro for $299: The TheraFace Pro includes six detachable magnetic heads for cleansing, microcurrent, percussive massage, and LED light therapy‚Äîblue light for acne, red light, and infrared for anti-aging. One WIRED writer tried the fancy facial device and said her skin was softer and brighter, but she noted that no studies prove that microcurrent is an effective facial treatment. You don't need to spend $400 on a skin-care gadget, but if you can afford it and like to pamper yourself‚Äîand you won't use it for a week and then forget about it in a drawer‚Äîit's nice to have a bunch of tools in one.\nTheragun Pro 5th Gen for $399: Therabody still sells a few older generations as well as refurbished models directly. Those are all likely still great. You may find even older models for sale on Amazon. While we haven't tried them all, we think it comes down to price. Anything older than 2019 or 2020 releases might not be worth it unless the price is shockingly low. This Pro came out in 2022, so it's still a solid device for athletes. If you can find it on sale and don't need all the latest updates, you should be happy with this one over the Pro Plus.\nTheragun Prime 4th Gen for $299: We did not test the Prime, but based on its specs, it's right in the middle of Theragun's pack. This probably isn't the best fit for a professional athlete who constantly working their body to the max, but for everyday aches and pains, it's more than sufficient.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nLast week, President Donald Trump announced he was adding to his growing list of tariffs with a new 25 percent charge on imported aluminum and steel, regardless of country of origin.\nAt first glance, things may not seem all that different from what happened in Trump‚Äôs first term. Back then, he announced a 25 percent tariff on imported steel, and a 10 percent one on imported aluminum, which both went into effect in 2018. Duty-free exemptions were later agreed with the likes of Canada, Mexico, and countries in the EU, but it seems these will be off the table when the new tariffs begin in March. \"No exemptions, no exceptions,‚Äù was Trump‚Äôs line on the fresh fees.\nBut what does that mean for the price of consumer electronics‚Äîand namely, your next phone? Aluminum is used heavily in the casing for premium handsets like Samsung's Galaxy S25 and Apple's iPhone 16. The iPhone's Pro line used stainless steel for years, and while it switched to titanium for the iPhone 15 Pro, rumors suggest the iPhone 17 family will be switching to aluminum across the board come September. Won‚Äôt these metal tariffs affect the cost of metal phones?\nIt‚Äôs not quite that simple. The US tariffs on aluminum and steel affect raw materials, not finished products or processed components, and we already know that almost no phones from Samsung or Apple are manufactured or assembled in the United States‚Äîsomething Trump could be trying to influence.\n‚ÄúThe products enter as finished goods, so it doesn't matter,‚Äù says Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research and a specialist in the tech supply chain.\n‚ÄúThere is some assembly happening in Texas for some Macs [the Mac Pro has been assembled in Texas since 2013], but those components are also with finished machining and not raw, so there's not much implication on pricing there either.‚Äù\nSo if you're planning on buying an iPhone this year or next, can you expect any impact on the cost at all? According to our own analysis of Apple‚Äôs latest supply chain disclosures, of the 13 metal ore and metal processing companies listed, eight operate predominantly in China. Two are in Japan, one is in Taiwan, Tata Electronics has a base in India, while POSCO International operates across South Korea and China for Apple‚Äôs purposes.\nThese territories would all be eligible for tariffs if the imported metal was raw, but by the time the metals Apple uses pass the US border, they have become something else.\nTrump‚Äôs metal tariffs won‚Äôt affect Apple (or any other smartphone manufacturer) directly, then, even if they cause significant turmoil in the cost of aluminum and steel in general. But the 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods Trump announced earlier could have a direct impact on the price you pay.\nAround 80 percent of the world's phones are made in China, and while Apple has moved some of its manufacturing and assembly to India, millions of iPhones are still produced by Foxconn in factories in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou.\nThe 10 percent tariffs, as it stands, will apply to these phones. And according to the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), it‚Äôs the American public who will end up paying the price.\n‚ÄúTariffs are taxes on American consumers, not foreign governments or companies. Increasing tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico will fuel inflation and raise prices on tech products, automotive manufacturing, and services,‚Äù says Gary Shapiro, CEO of the CTA, which is behind the annual CES tech trade show.\n‚ÄúTariffs are tools for resolving trade disputes‚Äînot political bargaining chips for issues like immigration or drug control.‚Äù\nThat probably explains why Apple‚Äôs share price dropped 3 percent after the China tariffs were officially announced. But even with those tariffs in place right now, they have not caused a sudden 10 percent rise in US iPhone prices. According to analysts, they may not even result in a 10 percent jump come September when the new iPhones are announced either.\n‚ÄúA 10 percent increase for the consumer will be a hard pill to swallow in a still-tough economy. So it‚Äôs quite possible the full 10 percent may not be passed to the end consumer or be negotiated down by that time,‚Äù says Nabila Popal, a senior research director at market intelligence firm IDC.\n‚ÄúAlthough the China tariff has ‚Äòstuck‚Äô so far, it is also possible the situation can change by then. Especially with Trump, anything can change at any time.‚Äù\nThese tariffs being a starting point for negotiations is something Apple is familiar with. The company was granted numerous tariff exemptions during Trump's first term, with Tim Cook even sending Trump a $6,000 Mac Pro after the added import costs on the line‚Äôs components were waived. This might help to explain why Cook was so visible at the inauguration this time around, or why he donated $1 million to Trump‚Äôs inaugural fund.\n‚ÄúApple, and other tech giants, work closely with the US government to carve out special exceptions,‚Äù says Popal. ‚ÄúWe have already seen Trump grant Apple exceptions from China tariffs in the past, so I won‚Äôt be surprised if it happens again.‚Äù\nMade in the USA?\nOf course, Trump's public rhetoric on the tariffs is that they are, in part, an effort to reinvigorate the American domestic industry. Phones might be small potatoes in the wider metal industry, but could these tariffs‚Äîand tariffs like them‚Äîever really encourage the iPhone, and other smartphones, to be made in the USA?\nOne somewhat lazy answer to that is, they would cost several times the price, thanks to higher US wages‚Äîa price consumers simply don't want to pay.\nHowever, this also downplays the importance of the expertise and infrastructure built up outside the West over not just years, but decades. Even if the metal for these phones could be found on US soil, the production of an iPhone is a global effort, and it‚Äôs the most complex components that can‚Äôt simply be shifted to homegrown production.\nFor example, Apple‚Äôs A18 and A18 Pro chipsets are made by TSMC, mostly in Taiwan. A few steps down the complexity chart, the iPhone 16 Pro‚Äôs IMX903 camera sensor is made by Sony Semiconductor Solutions Group in Japan. If this stuff isn‚Äôt made in America, you have to question whether you can really have a phone that is as US-made as Trump might want‚Äîeven if Apple was to make the bold step of opening an iPhone assembly plant within the United States.\nThere are some brighter signs for US domestic production, though. After years of development, TSMC‚Äôs first fabrication plant in Arizona is finally up and running, and in the process of producing the Apple A16 chips. But there's already a problem.\nThe A16 is two generations behind the latest iPhone CPU designs on the market from TSMC, and in late 2024, the Taiwanese government confirmed that production of TSMC‚Äôs very latest 2-nanometer designs is prohibited outside of the country.\nThe latest iPhones don‚Äôt use 2-nm architecture chips just yet, but they are expected to break that barrier next year. So where are America‚Äôs homegrown semiconductor giants?\nNvidia and AMD are fabless producers, meaning they outsource the production of their designs to other entities, predominantly‚Äîyou guessed it‚ÄîTSMC. Qualcomm is also almost entirely fabless, leaving Intel as the most well-known player that actually produces its own chipsets. There are early tenuous rumors that Apple may use Intel‚Äôs 2-nm processor production process for the iPhone 18 series in 2026.\nIt‚Äôs an expensive move Apple seems unlikely to make without significant government pressure, but it would be a key step forward in the long and uncertain journey to a more US-made iPhone.",

Subscribe Today.\nFirst, Shoes\nThe knit material and ventilated toe area give these shoes a socklike fit that hugs your feet while remaining breathable. Thanks to the BOA lacing system, you can make micro-adjustments, even while on the bike‚Äîa perk you don't get with a Velcro system. The one-button release also makes it quick and easy to get in and out of these shoes, which is a major perk if you tend to run late to class. They're compatible with both Delta and SPD cleats, and they come with Delta cleats, saving you from the extra purchase.\nCare Instructions: After your ride, wipe them down with a damp sponge or cloth. Stuff the insides with paper to maintain their shape. If the outsole gets dirty, a quick scrub with a soft brush should do the trick. Let them air dry.\nDelta cleats are the best for beginners, and they're my go-to too. Designed with a three-hole arrangement, this set is meant for optimal stability. They keep your feet secure so you don't have to worry about falling off your bike during some of those questionable choreography moves instructors love to throw in. To unlock, these cleats require a rotational foot movement, twisting your heel inward or outward, for safe disengagement. The built-in memory positioning is another handy feature, letting you save your cleat alignment when it's time to snap in a new pair.\nThese cleats pair with most Shimano SPD pedals, making them a reliable choice for most spin classes. Built from heat-treated forged steel, they're tough enough to handle the grind of daily sessions. You can adjust the spring tension to find your ideal resistance. But the standout feature here is the 13-degree release angle that lets you easily unclip after class‚Äîand without needing to over-rotate your heel to free yourself.\nHeart Rate Monitors\nHere are some of the best for indoor cycling, pulled from our guides to the Best Heart Rate Monitors and Best Fitness Trackers.\nThe Polar H10 is our favorite heart rate monitor for a couple of reasons. Chest straps, which place EKG sensors nearest to your heart, beat wrist-based monitors when it comes to precision. Contributor Michael Sawh especially loves the Polar H10 because of its buckle-style strap, which is way less irritating than the standard loop-and-hook connector. It's also designed with grippy silicone dots on the strap to keep it firmly in place no matter how much you sweat. Other features include built-in memory to store workout data and ANT+ connectivity to sync with stationary bikes. It's also waterproof, and the battery lasts for about a year.\nThe Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) strikes a balance between affordability and accessibility. The redesigned app offers features like skin temperature readings, 24/7 heart rate monitoring, and YouTube Music compatibility‚Äîif you have a premium subscription. Editor Adrienne So says the heart rate tracking is more accurate with the improved algorithm, and the battery lasts over a week. Many of its features are locked behind the $10-per-month Fitbit Premium subscription, but you can take advantage of its basic functionality without it. For more options, check out our guide to the Best Fitbits.\nThe 4iiii Viiiiva chest strap is our budget-friendly pick for heart rate monitors. At just $56, it delivers EKG-level accuracy and versatility for riders who may switch up their spin bike or studio. Its Bluetooth connectivity and ANT+ bridge let it send data from ANT+ devices, like indoor trainers, to your phone (iPhone or Android)‚Äîa major perk for Zwift users. The IPX7 rating means it can handle a post-spin soak in water (up to one meter for 30 minutes), but you'll still need to hand-wash it.\nGym Bags and Towels\nDon't be underestimated by the Lululemon 3-in-1 Gym Bag Duffle's compact design; it's deceptively spacious with thoughtful compartments to keep your gear tidy. It features a separate shoe compartment to stash your cycling cleats (or sneakers), a drawstring pouch for sweaty clothes, and a side zippered pocket that holds a 34-ounce water bottle. Carry it by the handles, sling it crossbody with the detachable strap, or repurpose the strap to haul a yoga mat if you're mixing workouts.\nCarry this duffle as a handbag, backpack, or crossbody bag, depending on how you commute to your studio. It's packed with compartments: a front zippered pocket for essentials, a shoe section, a wet/dry pocket for sweaty towels or wet toiletries, and a mesh bag for post-workout clothes. There's also a main compartment if you're commuting straight from work, plus zippered sections for tech essentials like an iPad and headphones. The AirFit Hyperbag is waterproof, dust-resistant, and easy to clean with a simple wipe-down.\nSpin class might not be hot yoga, but you'll still break a sweat. A workout towel is essential to keep the handlebars from getting slippery, your palms dry for a better grip, and sweat from streaming into your eyes mid-sprint. The Alo Yoga Performance No Sweat Hand Towel is soft and gentle on the skin, and it's quick-drying, too. It's a compact towel that I would normally wish to be larger, but it's the perfect size to tuck into your bike's storage slot.\nReusable Water Bottles\nFor spin class, I like bottles I can easily pop open and close during five-second breaks. I've highlighted a couple of favorites below, but our Best Reusable Water Bottles guide has more recommendations.\nThe Owala FreeSip makes water breaks efficient; you can sip or swig with its dual-action spout, so no fumbling with the cap mid-ride. The built-in straw minimizes the chances of spilling water all over yourself while you're pedaling out of the saddle (been there). My one gripe with this particular model is that the push button can occasionally get stuck, but it's a minor flaw in an otherwise ideal design.\nThe 25-ounce Yeti Yonder (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is another perfect bottle for spin class. It's lightweight‚Äîmade from 50 percent recycled plastic‚Äîand drop-resistant. Also, if you somehow drop it mid-ride, it won't startle the entire class the way a heavy-duty stainless steel bottle would. BPA-free, dishwasher-safe, and it's covered by a five-year warranty.\nHydro Flask's customizability makes it a top contender for any activity, including spin class. Pair yours with the Standard Mouth Flex Straw Cap ($15) for quick sips. You'll definitely hear it hit the ground if you drop it, but at least you can count on it to survive the fall. Hydro Flask offers several types of bottles and caps, including a tumbler, but it will most likely not fit into the bike's bottle holder.\nOther Helpful Gadgets\nI have owned variations of these biker shorts for five years now, and they're still among my favorites for cycling. They're buttery soft and lightweight yet squat-proof, so you don't have to worry about any see-through mishaps. The high-rise waistband doesn't roll whatsoever, and Nike's Dri-Fit tech is sweat-wicking. Available in sizes XXS to 3XL (tall options in select colors).\nYour spin shoes will stink‚Äîit's inevitable. This multipurpose spray is a lifesaver for more than just shoes, though; it works on spin bikes (if you've got one at home), gym bags, and other gym equipment. It masks odors and helps extend the life of your gear. Plus, it's nontoxic, non-irritating, and free of harsh chemicals like ammonium compounds, chlorine, and artificial fragrances.\nSometimes, the music is too loud.

    "content_text": "The Best USB-C Cables for Your Phone, Tablet, or Laptop\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nThe humble cable is often the simplest and fastest way to charge your devices or move files from one device to another. But these ostensibly straightforward power and data conduits come in many shapes and sizes. Even cables that appear identical may perform differently when you plug them into your phone or laptop. Various connectors, specifications, charging rates, and data transfer speeds make for a confusing, messy scene.\nDon't worry. We dived into the dreaded box of cables, identified the ones you need for various scenarios, and untangled them, ready for use. You'll find some advice here on USB-C, Lightning, and MicroUSB connectors, as well as a primer on everything you need to know about cables. After all, we're WIRED.\nUpdated February 2025: We added cables from Nomad and Nimble and honorable mentions for cables from QDOS, Chargeasap, Infinacore, and Krafted, removed a discontinued cable, reformatted the article, and updated prices.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nBefore You Buy\nCables are usually included in the box for whatever device you purchase. These are generally capable of charging the device at the maximum rate. Keep it safe, keep it simple, and if it is unmarked, consider labeling it.\nCheck your device's standards. Look for a cable that matches your needs. For example, if your device supports Power Delivery, then get a PD cable. Remember: The charging adapter also must support the same standards. We have more details about standards at the bottom of this guide.\nYou can use USB-C for displays. Manufacturers will state the data transfer speed or list support for 4K or 8K video on select cables. That means you can just use a USB-C to USB-C cable to transmit video from your laptop to your monitor. You should consider DisplayPort Alt Mode (DP Alt Mode) support, as this enables you to hook up displays and video sources that support DisplayPort.\nIt is safe to use your phone while it is charging, but it will charge at a slower rate. Heat is also bad for battery health, so it is best to take a break when your phone feels warm.\nPoorly made cables can overheat and start fires. To boost your chances of buying a dependable cable, look for USB-IF certification or stick to trustworthy brands like Anker, Cable Matters, or Syncwire.\nCharging Standards and Certification\nWith various standards and charging technologies at work, it is much harder than it should be to work out what a cable can do. There are a few things worth knowing when shopping.\nUSB Standards: The Universal Serial Bus (USB) standard dates to 1996 but has seen many new standards, revisions, and connector types in the years since. Instead of running through all of them here, we try to highlight what matters.\nConnectors: While USB-C is mercifully becoming a standard connection type, you want cables with connectors that fit your existing devices. Today, that still might mean USB-A, Lightning, or even MicroUSB. Remember that the capabilities of any cable are limited to its oldest connection type.\nData: The data transfer speed is always in megabits per second (Mbps) or gigabits per second (Gbps). You'll know the speed a cable should be capable of by the standard:\n- USB 2.0 supports 480 Mbps\n- USB 3.0 supports 5 Gbps\n- USB 3.1 supports 10 Gbps\n- USB 3.2 Gen 1 supports 5 Gbps\n- USB 3.2 Gen 2 supports 10 Gbps\n- USB 3.2 Gen 3 supports 20 Gbps\n- USB 4.0 supports 40 Gbps\nPower: While cable manufacturers always list the maximum charging rate, your device will determine how much power to draw, so it's important to know what standards it supports and combine your cable with the correct power adapter. The charging rate of a cable is measured in watts (W). Sometimes manufacturers will list specifications on the cable in tiny print. If there‚Äôs no W listed, you can calculate it by multiplying the voltage (V) and the current (A), assuming they are listed.\nBasic USB-C cables are passive and can only carry up to 60 watts. Cables that can carry 100 watts or more, sometimes described as active, must contain e-marker chips that identify the cable and its capabilities.\nThe Power Delivery (PD) standard is as close as we have to a common standard. A few manufacturers, like OnePlus, Oppo, and Xiaomi, still have proprietary charging standards. Then there's Qualcomm‚Äôs Quick Charge (QC) standard, which was the most popular for phones for many years, although Quick Charge 4+ supports PD. Even PD has a variant called Programmable Power Supply (PPS), which is part of the USB PD 3.0 standard. PPS allows for real-time adjustments to maximize efficiency and charge phones like Samsung's Galaxy S22 range at up to 45 watts instead of the usual 18. The latest addition to PD is Extended Power Range (EPR), which allows USB-C cables to carry up to 240 watts (they used to be limited to 100 watts).\nThunderbolt was a proprietary interface developed by Intel and Apple, but it's now open for royalty-free use (still certified by Intel). With Thunderbolt 3, the standard adopted the USB-C connector and is capable of data transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps and can deliver 100 watts of power using the PD standard. Thunderbolt 4 brings various improvements mostly related to the video signal (support for two 4K displays or an 8K display). It also supports the USB 4 standard and is backward compatible with previous standards.\nCable Certification: There are a few types of cable certification. When a cable is certified, that usually means it was independently tested and conforms to specific standards. It gives you, as a buyer, peace of mind that your cable performs as the manufacturer claims. Certification can be expensive, so many cable manufacturers shun it, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean their cables are poor quality. The USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing USB technology. Run by members like Apple, Google, HP, Microsoft, and Intel, it sets specifications and offers certification. If a cable is certified by the USB-IF, it has been tested to ensure it complies with its standards. Apple has its own Made for iPhone (MFi) certification for Lightning cables. Intel certifies Thunderbolt cables. Certified cables usually have the relevant logo on the connector. (For example, Thunderbolt cables have a lightning bolt.)\nMore USB-C Cables We Have Tested\nThere are so many cables out there, and plenty of solid options did not make the cut. Here are a few I‚Äôve tested and liked.\n- QDOS PowerMotion Ultra for ¬£32: This USB 4.0 cable is a solid alternative to our top picks for folks in the UK, combining up to 240-watt charging with data transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps. It is relatively thick, feels durable, and comes with a lifetime warranty. I like the braided nylon finish and color-matched cable tie.\n- Chargeasap Connect Pro for $60: Magnetic tip cables can be handy for kids and folks with dexterity issues. The idea is you stick the relevant tip in your device and then attach the cable magnetically when you need to charge. This one also has an LED display to show real-time power usage. It works best if you leave the tips in your devices, but that means they can‚Äôt be charged by regular cables, and the tips are very easy to lose if you remove them. Performance-wise, it‚Äôs a standard 100-watt charging cable.\n- InfinaCore LED Charging Cable for $24: I love this stylish cable from InfinaCore, as it has transparent plugs with a tiny LED to show wattage and is finished in a smart-looking navy-blue braiding. Functionally, it‚Äôs the same as the Baseus cable with LED above (100-watt charging), but it costs a few dollars more.\n- Krafted Connex for ¬£30: I like the idea of a Swiss Army Knife‚Äìstyle charging cable keyring, but the execution here is flawed. It does offer USB-A, USB-C, Lightning, and MicroUSB, but the flip-out plugs don‚Äôt have any cable attached, so they are not very adjustable, making it tough to plug into some ports. The Rolling Square InCharge X 6-in-1 Cable above is the same price and works far better.\n- Scosche Strikeline Premium USB-C Cable for $25: This braided cable comes in various lengths all the way up to the 10-foot cable I tested, and it‚Äôs a good alternative to our best long cable above if data transfer is more important to you than charging speed because it offers 5 Gbps data speeds, but only 60 watts for charging.\n- Ugreen Uno USB-C Cable for $13: I love the smiley-faced Uno line from UGreen, but I assumed the display on this cable would show the charging rate. It does not. It just displays smiley eyes when charging and changes when fully charged. I tested the 6.6-foot cable, but it also comes in 1.6-, 3.3-, or 10-foot lengths. It feels durable and is reasonably priced, but is rated at a very ordinary 100 watts and 480 Mbps.\n- Native Union Pocket Cable for $30: This wee braided USB-C to USB-C cable is perfect for slipping on a keyring to ensure you are never caught without a cable. It‚Äôs a nice design with braided cables, but you only get around 7 inches and it maxes out at 60 watts. It is built to last from recycled materials, USB-IF certified, and comes with a lifetime warranty.\n- Caudabe ChargeFlex for $25: This was our Lightning recommendation and it's still good, but the price has gone up and there's no need to spend this much. It is a thick braided cable reinforced with Kevlar for durability. There is a leather clip you can use for cable management, and the ridged finish on the connectors makes them easy to grip when unplugging.\n- Cable Matters Gen 2 USB-A to USB-C cable for $10: This is a good alternative to our pick above if you want faster data transfer speeds (it maxes out at 10 Gbps), but it is limited to 15 watts for charging.\n- Bluebonnet Eco-Friendly Charging Cable for $25: Bluebonnet (an Austin-based studio named after the Texas state flower) made this cable from naturally biodegradable wheat straw. It promises 50,000 plus bends and uses plastic-free packaging. I love the dappled blue finish and the cream ends. They make it easy to pick this cable out of the crowd. It‚Äôs nothing special performance-wise, offering up to 60-watt charging and 480 Mbps data transfer.\n- RUGD Rhino Power USB-C to USB-C for ¬£11: This is a solid option for folks in the UK seeking a tough cable. It has a braided nylon finish and can withstand a minimum of 100 kilograms of tension and 100,000 bends. It can also deliver up to 60 watts.\n- Nomad USB-C Cable for $30: This Kevlar-reinforced, braided cable feels durable, charges at up to 100 watts with a Power Delivery charger, and comes with a handy silicone cable tie, but it‚Äôs a USB 2.0 cable, so tops out at 480 Mbps for data transfer. I also tried the Nomad Universal Cable ($35), a USB-C to USB-C cable with slide-on connectors for USB-A or MicroUSB. It‚Äôs versatile but the connectors are stiff and you must be careful to slot them on securely for it to work properly. Both are good, if a little pricey.\n- Casetify Powerthru USB-C to Lightning Cable for $28: This tough, braided cable comes in some fun colors (most notably cotton candy), but it‚Äôs kinda pricey for a 100-watt charging cable.\n- Iniu Braided USB-C Cable for $9: This is a cheap, 6.6-foot USB-C to USB-C charging cable that tops out at 100 watts. Data transfer is only 480 Mbps. One end lights up green when it‚Äôs charging.\n- Anker Powerline III for $10: This cable is slim, but durable, with textured USB-C heads that make it easy to grip when removing. While it can go up to 100 watts for charging, it is‚Äîsomewhat confusingly‚Äînot as good as the Powerline II for data transfer because it maxes out at 480 Mbps.\n- Baseus 2-in-1 USB-C Cable for $18: We like the idea of a single USB-C at one end and two at the other, allowing you to charge two devices at up to 100 watts from a single cable. Sadly, the splitter section is bulky, some devices we plugged in were slow to charge, and data transfer maxes out at 480 Mbps. The linked cable is 4.9 feet long, but you can get 3.3-feet and 10-feet lengths.\n- Lindy USB 3.2 Type C to C Cable for $19: These active cables are suitable for hooking monitors up to your computer, and they support up to 8K at 60 Hz and 4K at 120 Hz. They also support DisplayPort 1.4. I tested the longer 3- and 5-meter variants that max out at 60 watts for Power Delivery and 10 Gbps for data (but they‚Äôre out of stock). The shorter cable linked here can go up to 20 Gbps. They work well and feel durable, but they‚Äôre a bit pricey.\n- Satechi USB-C to USB-C Charging Cable for $20: Gear from Satechi always has a classy look, and its braided nylon cables are no exception. This one is 6.5 feet, has a Velcro strap, and is capable of 100-watt charging, with support for PD and QC. Sadly, data transfer is limited to 480 Mbps. I also tested Satechi‚Äôs equally good-looking 6-foot USB-C to Lightning Charging Cable ($25).\n- Plugable Thunderbolt 4 Transfer Cable for $60: This active Thunderbolt 4 USB-C to USB-C cable matches our top pick with support for 100-watt charging and data transfers up to 40 Gbps. It is 6.6 feet long and comes with a two-year warranty.\n- Belkin Boost Charge USB-C for $8: This cable maxes out at 12 watts and 480 Mbps. The basic PVC finish is the cheapest, but you can opt for braided nylon too; both come in black or white at 3.3 or 6.6 feet. These cables are USB-IF certified and work as advertised (I've been using one in the car for the last few months).",

Learn more.\nThe original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nComputer scientists often deal with abstract problems that are hard to comprehend, but an exciting new algorithm matters to anyone who owns books and at least one shelf. The algorithm addresses something called the library sorting problem (more formally, the ‚Äúlist labeling‚Äù problem). The challenge is to devise a strategy for organizing books in some kind of sorted order‚Äîalphabetically, for instance‚Äîthat minimizes how long it takes to place a new book on the shelf.\nImagine, for example, that you keep your books clumped together, leaving empty space on the far right of the shelf. Then, if you add a book by Isabel Allende to your collection, you might have to move every book on the shelf to make room for it. That would be a time-consuming operation. And if you then get a book by Douglas Adams, you‚Äôll have to do it all over again. A better arrangement would leave unoccupied spaces distributed throughout the shelf‚Äîbut how, exactly, should they be distributed?\nThis problem was introduced in a 1981 paper, and it goes beyond simply providing librarians with organizational guidance. That‚Äôs because the problem also applies to the arrangement of files on hard drives and in databases, where the items to be arranged could number in the billions. An inefficient system means significant wait times and major computational expense. Researchers have invented some efficient methods for storing items, but they‚Äôve long wanted to determine the best possible way.\nLast year, in a study that was presented at the Foundations of Computer Science conference in Chicago, a team of seven researchers described a way to organize items that comes tantalizingly close to the theoretical ideal. The new approach combines a little knowledge of the bookshelf‚Äôs past contents with the surprising power of randomness.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very important problem,‚Äù said Seth Pettie, a computer scientist at the University of Michigan, because many of the data structures we rely upon today store information sequentially. He called the new work ‚Äúextremely inspired [and] easily one of my top three favorite papers of the year.‚Äù\nNarrowing Bounds\nSo how does one measure a well-sorted bookshelf? A common way is to see how long it takes to insert an individual item. Naturally, that depends on how many items there are in the first place, a value typically denoted by n. In the Isabel Allende example, when all the books have to move to accommodate a new one, the time it takes is proportional to n. The bigger the n, the longer it takes. That makes this an ‚Äúupper bound‚Äù to the problem: It will never take longer than a time proportional to n to add one book to the shelf.\nThe authors of the 1981 paper that ushered in this problem wanted to know if it was possible to design an algorithm with an average insertion time much less than n. And indeed, they proved that one could do better. They created an algorithm that was guaranteed to achieve an average insertion time proportional to (log n)2. This algorithm had two properties: It was ‚Äúdeterministic,‚Äù meaning that its decisions did not depend on any randomness, and it was also ‚Äúsmooth,‚Äù meaning that the books must be spread evenly within subsections of the shelf where insertions (or deletions) are made. The authors left open the question of whether the upper bound could be improved even further. For over four decades, no one managed to do so.\nHowever, the intervening years did see improvements to the lower bound. While the upper bound specifies the maximum possible time needed to insert a book, the lower bound gives the fastest possible insertion time. To find a definitive solution to a problem, researchers strive to narrow the gap between the upper and lower bounds, ideally until they coincide. When that happens, the algorithm is deemed optimal‚Äîinexorably bounded from above and below, leaving no room for further refinement.\nIn 2004, a team of researchers found that the best any algorithm could do for the library sorting problem‚Äîin other words, the ultimate lower bound‚Äîwas log n. This result pertained to the most general version of the problem, applying to any algorithm of any type. Two of the same authors had already secured a result for a more specific version of the problem in 1990, showing that for any smooth algorithm, the lower bound is significantly higher: (log n)2. And in 2012, another team proved the same lower bound, (log n)2, for any deterministic algorithm that does not use randomness at all.\nThese results showed that for any smooth or deterministic algorithm, you could not achieve an average insertion time better than (log n)2, which was the same as the upper bound established in the 1981 paper. In other words, to improve that upper bound, researchers would need to devise a different kind of algorithm. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to do better, you have to be randomized and non-smooth,‚Äù said Michael Bender, a computer scientist at Stony Brook University.\nBut getting rid of smoothness, which requires items to be spread apart more or less evenly, seemed like a mistake. (Remember the problems that arose from our initial example‚Äîthe non-smooth configuration where all the books were clumped together on the left-hand side of the shelf.) And it also was not obvious how leaving things to random chance‚Äîessentially a coin toss‚Äîwould help matters. ‚ÄúIntuitively, it wasn‚Äôt clear that was a direction that made sense,‚Äù Bender said.\nNevertheless, in 2022, Bender and five colleagues decided to try out a randomized, non-smooth algorithm anyway, just to see whether it might offer any advantages.\nA Secret History\nIronically, progress came from another restriction. There are sound privacy or security reasons why you may want to use an algorithm that‚Äôs blind to the history of the bookshelf. ‚ÄúIf I had 50 Shades of Grey on my bookshelf and took it off,‚Äù said William Kuszmaul of Carnegie Mellon University, nobody would be able to tell.\nIn a 2022 paper, Bender, Kuszmaul, and four coauthors created just such an algorithm‚Äîone that was ‚Äúhistory independent,‚Äù non-smooth, and randomized‚Äîwhich finally reduced the 1981 upper bound, bringing the average insertion time down to (log n)1.5.\nKuszmaul remembers being surprised that a tool normally used to ensure privacy could confer other benefits. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if you used cryptography to make your algorithm faster,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhich just seems kind of strange.‚Äù\nHelen Xu of the Georgia Institute of Technology, who was not part of this research team, was also impressed. She said that the idea of using history independence for reasons other than security may have implications for many other types of problems.\nClosing the Gap\nBender, Kuszmaul, and others made an even bigger improvement with last year‚Äôs paper. They again broke the record, lowering the upper bound to (log n) times (log log n)3‚Äîequivalent to (log n)1.000‚Ä¶1. In other words, they came exceedingly close to the theoretical limit, the ultimate lower bound of log n.\nOnce again, their approach was non-smooth and randomized, but this time their algorithm relied on a limited degree of history dependence. It looked at past trends to plan for future events, but only up to a point. Suppose, for instance, you‚Äôve been getting a lot of books by authors whose last name starts with N‚ÄîNabokov, Neruda, Ng. The algorithm extrapolates from that and assumes more are probably coming, so it‚Äôll leave a little extra space in the N section. But reserving too much space could lead to trouble if a bunch of A-name authors start pouring in. ‚ÄúThe way we made it a good thing was by being strategically random about how much history to look at when we make our decisions,‚Äù Bender said.\nThe result built on and transformed their previous work. It ‚Äúuses randomness in a completely different way than the 2022 paper,‚Äù Pettie said.\nThese papers collectively represent ‚Äúa significant improvement‚Äù on the theory side, said Brian Wheatman, a computer scientist at the University of Chicago. ‚ÄúAnd on the applied side, I think they have the potential for a big improvement as well.‚Äù\nXu agrees. ‚ÄúIn the past few years, there‚Äôs been interest in using data structures based on list labeling for storing and processing dynamic graphs,‚Äù she said. These advances would almost certainly make things faster.\nMeanwhile, there‚Äôs more for theorists to contemplate. ‚ÄúWe know that we can almost do log n,‚Äù Bender said, ‚Äú[but] there‚Äôs still this tiny gap‚Äù‚Äîthe diminutive log log n term that stands in the way of a complete solution. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know if the right thing to do is to lower the upper bound or raise the lower bound.‚Äù\nPettie, for one, doesn‚Äôt expect the lower bound to change. ‚ÄúUsually in these situations, when you see a gap this close, and one of the bounds looks quite natural and the other looks unnatural, then the natural one is the right answer,‚Äù he said. It‚Äôs much more likely that any future improvements will affect the upper bound, bringing it all the way down to log n. ‚ÄúBut the world‚Äôs full of weird surprises.‚Äù\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

In the Isabel Allende example, when all the books have to move to accommodate a new one, the time it takes is proportional to <em>n</em>. The bigger the <em>n</em>, the longer it takes. That makes this an ‚Äúupper bound‚Äù to the problem: It will never take longer than a time proportional to <em>n</em> to add one book to the shelf.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The authors of the 1981 paper that ushered in this problem wanted to know if it was possible to design an algorithm with an average insertion time much less than <em>n</em>. And indeed, they proved that one could do better. They created an algorithm that was guaranteed to achieve an average insertion time proportional to (log <em>n</em>)<sup>2</sup>. This algorithm had two properties: It was ‚Äúdeterministic,‚Äù meaning that its decisions did not depend on any randomness, and it was also ‚Äúsmooth,‚Äù meaning that the books must be spread evenly within subsections of the shelf where insertions (or deletions) are made. The authors left open the question of whether the upper bound could be improved even further. For over four decades, no one managed to do so.</p><p class=\"paywall\">However, the intervening years did see improvements to the lower bound. While the upper bound specifies the maximum possible time needed to insert a book, the lower bound gives the fastest possible insertion time. To find a definitive solution to a problem, researchers strive to narrow the gap between the upper and lower bounds, ideally until they coincide. When that happens, the algorithm is deemed optimal‚Äîinexorably bounded from above and below, leaving no room for further refinement.</p></div></div></body></html>",

Subscribe Today.\nBest Presidents‚Äô Day Mattress Deals (and Toppers!)\nSaatva's early Presidents‚Äô Day sale has gotten started and includes the wide range of mattresses we love, especially if you're struggling with back pain or need extra support. But the best price you can find is actually with our exclusive links below, which will apply a $400 coupon off the base price of your mattress of choice. This link will apply the coupon in general to Saatva's site, while our links below will apply it to the specified mattress. Saatva is usually running some kind of discount on its mattresses, but this is a better price than you'll find on Saatva's site without our coupon. It's also worth noting that the Rx mattress increased in price in 2025, so this discount is off the new base price.\n- Fantastic for pressure pain: Saatva Rx for $2,999 ($400 Off, Click This Coupon Link)\n- A great option for lumbar support: Saatva Classic for $1,699 ($400 Off, Click This Coupon Link)\n- An adjustable splurge: Saatva Solaire for $4,199 ($400 Off, Click This Coupon Link)\nHelix has a Presidents‚Äô Day sale underway right now for 25 percent off, but you can get a better discount with our exclusive code WIRED27 for 27 percent off sitewide. Plus, if you buy a Luxe or Elite mattress with this code, you can get two free pillows, a sheet set, and a mattress protector all included with your purchase. We love a bunch of Helix's Luxe mattresses‚Äîthe Midnight Luxe is our favorite mattress ever‚Äîso it's a great time to shop our picks, as 27 percent off is the lowest we ever see it go, and that's only with a custom code. The discount listed is based off the price we usually see these mattresses available for, and you'll add the discount code on the checkout page.\n- Our favorite overall mattress: Helix Midnight Luxe for $1,733 ($166 Off, Use Code WIRED27)\n- A great mattress for back pain: Helix Twilight Luxe with ErgoAlign Layer for $1,926 ($172 Off, Use Code WIRED27)\n- A great hybrid mattress topper: Helix GlacioTex Premium Mattress Topper for $364 ($35 Off, Use Code WIRED27)\nNolah's Presidents‚Äô Day sale isn't anything too crazy‚Äîwe often see the Evolution 15 for the current 35 percent off discount (and that's still the price we recommend buying it for!), but you can get an extra $50 off with our custom code WIRED50, bringing this down to a lower price. It's not the lowest discount we've seen, but it is better than you'll usually find. Plus, Nolah is also offering two free pillows with a mattress purchase, and $150 off the BedJet 3 (8/10, WIRED Reviews). The BedJet is essentially a fan with a hose to pump air underneath your sheets, helping to maintain a specific temperature (air circulation is key in cooling sheets, after all). It's an intriguing offer, and if you wanted to buy a BedJet anyway (and need a new mattress), you can get both at once with this sale. Nolah also has its mattress topper on sale for its usual ticket price, but you won't get the BedJet discount.\n- Great firm mattress for side sleepers: Nolah Evolution 15 for $1,574 ($50 Off, Use Code WIRED50)\n- For that new mattress feel: Nolah Mattress Topper for $292\nBear‚Äôs early Presidents‚Äô Day sale is one of the better early sales to jump on. While the site is often 30 percent off, you can get 35 percent off right now with the code PRESDAY. We're big fans of the Bear Elite Hybrid, which is a top pick in our guide to side-sleeper mattresses. The firmest option is soon to be a pick in our guide to mattresses for back pain too. You'll also get two free pillows with your purchase; that‚Äôs not uncommon, but it‚Äôs still a nice perk.\n- Our favorite side-sleeper mattress: Bear Elite Hybrid for $1,499 ($115 Off)\nLeesa makes several mattresses we like, with our favorite being the Sapira Chill Hybrid‚Äîit's the runner-up pick in our Best Mattresses guide. Leesa's Presidents‚Äô Day sale has 30 percent off this and several other mattresses (no code needed), including one of our favorite cooling mattresses, and any mattress purchase will include two free pillows. It tops the usual 20 percent discount you can find on Leesa, so it's a great time to shop. The savings shown below are off the usual discounted price.\n- A great choice for problem sleepers: Leesa Sapira Chill Hybrid Mattress for $1,511 ($216 Off)\n- A great cooling mattress: Leesa Legend Chill Hybrid Mattress for $1,959 ($280 Off)\nBedgear's early Presidents‚Äô Day sale started extra early, and it includes a range of mattresses and other sleep accessories like pillows and sheets (check out our guide to those sales below). Not all mattresses have the same great discount, though‚Äîour favorite cheap cooling mattress, the S Performance, has a nice little $50 discount, while the modular M3 Performance, our favorite cooling mattress for couples, has a nice $300 discount right now.\n- Best cooling mattress for couples: Bedgear Split Head M3 Performance Mattress for $2,199 ($300 Off)\n- Best cheap cooling mattress: Bedgear S Performance Mattress (Medium Firm) for $749 ($50 Off)\nBrooklyn Bedding's Sale now has 30 percent off its site with the code PRESDAY30, and you can get the best price you'll find all year on the extra-firm Plank mattress. It's already a very affordable mattress, and is usually on sale for $999, but you can get it for even lower right now. The organic version, the Plank Firm Natural, is getting discontinued, but it's a great mattress that's also on sale while it's still in stock.\n- Our favorite firm mattress: Plank Firm for $932 ($67 Off, Use Code PRESDAY30)\n- A soon-to-be discontinued organic version: Plank Firm Natural for $1,492 ($107 Off, Use Code PRESDAY30)\nCasper is pretty famous in the mattress-in-a-box universe. It's remade its entire mattress line since reaching peak mattress fame, and the base mattress‚Äînamed The One‚Äîis our favorite all-foam mattress. It's already really affordable, and usually has some kind of sale going on anyway to bring it under $9,000, but you can get it for even cheaper than usual right now. This is the lowest price we usually see it go.\n- Our favorite all-foam mattress: Casper The One for $799 ($71 Off)\nHere at WIRED, we're obviously big technology fans. Sleep Number makes a couple of different smart beds, including the popular i8 (which is $1,000 off right now), but we've tested only the more expensive Climate360 (5/10, WIRED Reviews). It lets you control both temperature and firmness for your side of the bed, collects sleep data, and has a cozy foot warmer. It's seriously expensive‚Äîwe're talking five-digit price tag, before the decimal point‚Äîand the app wasn't great when we tested it in 2023, but you can get it for 20 percent off right now.\n- For temperature and firmness control: Sleep Number Climate360 Smart Bed for $7,999 ($2,000 Off)\nBest Presidents‚Äô Day Organic Mattress Deals (and Toppers!)\nAlong with the rest of Saatva's lineup, Saatva's organic offering, the Zenhaven, is on sale right now. It's our favorite flippable organic mattress, with both a plush and firm side you can choose between, and now you can score it for a true sale price. It's the best early sale right now of Saatva's mattresses without our exclusive coupon codes, but you'll get an even better discount with our code below.\n- The best flippable organic mattress: Saatva Zenhaven for $2,999 ($400 off)\nBirch is the organic sister brand to Helix, so it's no surprise we love the brand's mattresses as much as we love Helix's. Birch makes both our absolute favorite organic mattress and the best mattress topper we've tested, so it's always worth shopping at Birch, but especially now with its official Presidents‚Äô Day Sale underway with 25 percent off the site. Even better, you can use our custom code WIRED27 to get 27 percent off the entire site. That 27 percent off is the best discount we see for these great organic mattresses (and the best topper ever) for, and the savings shown are based off of that usual price we see.\n- The best organic mattress: Birch Luxe Natural Mattress for $1,916 ($183 Off, Use Code WIRED27)\n- A great organic option for side sleepers: Birch Natural Mattress for $1,367 ($132 Off, Use Code WIRED27)\n- The best mattress topper: Birch Organic Plush Top Mattress Topper for $364 ($35 Off, Use Code WIRED27)\nAvocado's early Presidents‚Äô Day sale is underway, with up to 20 percent off the entire site. We often see a 10 percent or so discount on mattresses, so this is a better sale than you'll usually find on Avocado's organic mattresses. Mattress toppers‚Äîwhich aren't often on sale like mattresses are‚Äîare on sale for 10 percent off. There are sales on pillows and bedding, too, which you can check out in our section below about the best bedding deals.\n- A great organic mattress: Avocado Green Mattress for $1,699 ($150 Off)\n- The best latex mattress topper: Avocado Eco Organic Mattress Topper for $269 ($30 Off)\nMore Presidents‚Äô Day Mattress Sales\nNectar makes a great range of softer memory foam mattresses, and its site is running up to 50 percent off mattresses right now. However, the model we recommend for pressure relief, the Nectar Premier, is on sale for the price we usually see it available for. It's still a price worth shopping, but it's not a super rare discount.\n- Super soft pressure relief: Nectar Premier Memory Foam Mattress for $949\nThe Best Presidents‚Äô Day Bedding Sales\nCozy Earth makes one of our favorite bamboo sheet sets; it's a decadently soft set that's worth splurging on already, and it's on sale right now for Cozy Earth's sale. Cozy Earth also makes great ribbed towels and a super soft down alternative comforter, both of which I can't stop using on a daily basis. While the website is running 25 percent off the site, you can get 30 percent off with our code WIRED.\n- The best luxury bamboo sheets: Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set for $231 ($99 Off, Use Code WIRED)\n- A super soft down alternative comforter: Cozy Earth Down Alternative Comforter for $237 ($102 Off, Use Code WIRED)\n- Super soft ribbed towels: Cozy Earth Ribbed Terry Bath Towels (Set of Two) for $105 ($45 Off, Use Code WIRED)\nIf you've ever shopped for sheets online, you've heard of Brooklinen. The bedding brand makes everything from sheets and pillows to towels and robes, and all of it is great quality. It's also pretty well priced, too, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't jump on its sale. Right now Brooklinen is offering 25 percent off its sateen sheets, 20 percent off its organic percale sheets, and a wild 40 percent off of its washed linen sheets.\n- Massively discounted linen sheets: Brooklinen Washed Linen Core Sheet Set for $155 ($164 Off)\n- Fantastic sateen sheets: Brooklinen Luxe Sateen Core Sheet Set for $142 ($57 Off)\n- One of our favorite organic sheet sets: Brooklinen Organic Cotton Core Sheet Set for $183 ($46 Off)\nCoop makes fantastic pillows and other bedding and home products, ranging from sheets to towels. Coop is best known for its Original Adjustable Pillow, which will be added soon to our guide to the best pillows. The brand's EdenCool+ Adjustable Pillow is already a pick as the best cooling side sleeper pillow, and it's one I've been sleeping on for months and loving. Both these pillows are on sale right now for 20 percent off, and you can also find 40 percent off Coop's crisp percale sheets.\n- The best cooling side sleeper pillow: Coop EdenCool+ Adjustable Pillow (Cut Out) for $119 ($30 Off)\n- A super comfy side sleeper pillow: Coop Original Adjustable Pillow (Cut Out) for $71 ($18 Off)\n- Hotel-crisp percale sheets: Cool Percale Sheet Set for $89 ($60 Off)\nAvocado's sale isn't just for its mattresses and toppers. You'll find a small discount on our favorite down pillow from Avocado, and on Avocado's organic sheets that we've tested and recommend.\n- The best down pillow: Avocado Down Pillow for $98 ($11 Off)\n- Luxuriously silky organic cotton sheets: Avocado Organic Cotton Sheets for $161 ($18 off)\n- Heavy, organic linen sheets on sale: Avocado Natural Linen Sheets for $449 ($50 off)\nBuffy is usually on sale, but its amazing percale sheets are on sale for a better price than we've seen lately. The brand got its name for its fantastically airy comforters (they're named Cloud and Breeze for a reason), and Buffy's newest offering, percale cotton sheets, are some of the softest cotton sheets we've tried since they use Supima cotton. Everything else is on sale, too, but for a price we usually see it on sale for.\n- Some of the softest (but still breathable) cotton sheets ever: Buffy Supima Cotton Sheet Set for $120 ($30 Off)\n- Silky-soft eucalyptus-based sheets: Buffy Breeze Sheet Set for $156\n- A fantastic cooling comforter: Buffy Cloud Comforter for $156",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe world's best chocolate makers often ask that you eat their bonbons within mere days of when they were produced. But does chocolate go bad? The answer is complicated, but one thing is clear. Once you've procured some of the finest chocolate that money can buy (see WIRED's guide to the best delivery chocolate boxes in the country), you'll want to preserve that deliciousness.\n‚ÄúA bonbon is a fresh product, with filling and some degree of moisture. The flavors will lose potency over time,‚Äù said Estelle Tracy, a chocolate sommelier in the Philadelphia area who has hosted hundreds of chocolate tastings. ‚ÄúIf there was one thing I wish people knew, it's that you should look at a bonbon the way you look at cake. You don't buy cake to eat it in three weeks!‚Äù\nThe best artisan chocolate makers speed delivery of their bonbons to your doorstep, often within days of being made. And yet if you've bought that chocolate as a gift, whether for Valentine's Day or a birthday, you might not be able to eat it right away.\nI consulted internationally renowned chocolatier and chocolate educator Melissa Coppel, and asked her advice on the best ways to keep your chocolate flavorful and fresh. I also asked Tracy, the sommelier, how to assess whether the chocolate in your cupboard is past its prime.\nTreat Your Chocolate Well, It‚Äôll Return the Favor\nFirst off, some assurances. A chocolate bar generally won't ‚Äúgo bad‚Äù the way fruit goes bad.\n‚ÄúGenerally speaking, chocolate is a very shelf-stable product,‚Äù Coppel told me, before digging into the food science. Bacteria and yeast and all the nasty little things that make food go bad need moisture to be happy. Food scientists rank food's likelihood of spoiling by checking its ‚Äúwater activity‚Äù‚Äîessentially the humidity of a piece of food‚Äî on a scale from 0 to 1.\nAnything below 0.60 is considered a durable dry good that's unlikely to develop unwanted passengers. A chocolate bar rings in at a quite dry 0.30 to 0.40, the same range as cough drops and saltine crackers. A dark chocolate bar will keep for months and months. So if you buy bean-to-bar chocolate from WIRED's top pure chocolate pick, Dandelion, you generally won't have to look over your shoulder.\nBut that doesn't mean chocolate bars aren't fragile. Over time, temperatures above 70 degrees Fahrenheit, or an ambient humidity above 50 percent, will begin to separate out the fats and sugars in chocolate, wrecking its texture and giving it not-so-lovely white speckles and streaks.\nTo avoid this, most chocolatiers recommend storing their chocolate at temperatures between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Monitor humidity, and store your chocolate airtight. As with other foods that contain fat‚Äîthink cheese‚Äîchocolate loves to pick up stray odors from your fridge or basement if you let it. Don't let it.\nThe Fragility of Bonbons\nBut if chocolate itself keeps quite well, a high-end bonbon is far less predictable. The fillings may contain more moisture and keep less well than the chocolate itself.\nA ‚Äúwell-formulated filling‚Äù of ganache or caramel or marzipan might allow a bonbon to last anywhere from a month to most of a year, according to Coppel, depending on its moisture content. One shouldn't worry a bonbon from a good chocolatier will spoil or go bad anytime soon unless you store your chocolate in a hot and humid place without air-conditioning. But bonbons will always taste better fresh.\nMost artisan chocolatiers recommend eating within a week or two of receipt, in fact. Many high-end chocolatiers use fresh fruit or nuts, and spurn preservatives that might compromise flavor or texture. Some ship only overnight and beg you to eat their bonbons within a few days of receipt.\nThis is normal: Chocolatiers want you to try their chocolate at its best, so you will say nice things about it and then buy more. Coppel advises that you pay close attention to the stated shelf life of each bonbon you buy.\n‚ÄúI know that when we splurge on chocolate, we want it to be as fresh as possible. The last thing we want is to leave a bonbon box sitting somewhere in our house for two months before we can share it with our loved ones,‚Äù notes Coppel. She recommends storing her own bonbons for no more than 10 days in a cool, dry place between 64 and 70 degrees. New York's Kreuther, whose pie bonbons were among our favorite fruit-filled confections, allows for a few week's grace at 68 degrees.\nIf you're keeping your bonbons much more than a week before eating, this is when we start talking about fridges and freezers.\nNothing That Isn‚Äôt Cold Can Stay\n‚ÄúI rarely advise my customers to refrigerate or freeze their bonbons, but it‚Äôs not because it can‚Äôt be done. It‚Äôs more that it requires a few steps to make sure the bonbons are still as beautiful as they were when I shipped them,‚Äù Coppel notes.\nIf you know you're keeping your bonbons for longer than a week, Coppel says, a fridge or wine cooler is your best bet for keeping chocolate flavors fresh and potent. Most sources recommend wrapping bonbons tightly in plastic‚Äîor in an airtight container‚Äîbefore storing in a refrigerator, to avoid your chocolates picking up funny flavors from whatever else is in the fridge.\n‚ÄúIf you have a wine cooler, you‚Äôre in luck. That‚Äôs the best appliance you can use to store bonbons. Place your bonbons there at 16¬∞C or 60¬∞F (if you want to be even more precise, the cooler should have a relative humidity between 60-70%),‚Äù according to written instructions sent by Coppel.\nFailing wine coolers, a more standard fridge will do. Coppel cautions that after you keep your chocolates in the fridge, you should take them out and let them reach room temperature again before eating.\n‚ÄúOtherwise, the fillings will be hard, and the flavors won‚Äôt come through as much as they should, because cold inhibits flavor perception,‚Äù Coppel remarks.\nHow to Freeze and Travel With Chocolate\nLet's say you're sending chocolate long distances, or you otherwise need to keep your bonbons longer than two weeks? You can freeze your chocolate for up to a year. ‚ÄúYes, you can do this,‚Äù Coppel notes, ‚Äúand all the big chocolate productions do.‚Äù\nHere are Coppel's instructions for freezing at home, without subjecting your chocolate to rapid shifts in temperature:\n- Wrap your chocolate box very well in plastic and place it in the freezer.\n- When you‚Äôre ready to take the bonbons out, don‚Äôt unwrap or open the box right away, as condensation might build up and ruin the gloss of your bonbons.\n- The temperature of the box needs to be brought up very gently, so transfer them (still wrapped in plastic) from the freezer to the fridge for 24 hours.\n- The next day, take them out of the fridge and let them come to room temperature (one hour before eating them, more or less).\n- Now you can remove the plastic and open the box. Your bonbons should be perfect.\nIf you plan to travel with chocolate, or mail it long distances, Coppel also recommends freezing it first. Here are her instructions for a pleasant, chocolate-filled trip.\n- Wrap your chocolate box very well in plastic and place it in the freezer.\n- Place the wrapped, frozen box in a bag, and insert some ice packs to keep it frozen.\n- Take them out and let them come at room temperature.\n- Unwrap them and eat.\nMuch the same process goes for mailing chocolate, but in this case, your recipient will be the one who needs to gently let the chocolate come back to room temperature before eating. Coppel notes that in place of wrapping a chocolate box in plastic, one can also vacuum seal chocolate in a sous-vide bag, as long as you don't wrap it too tightly.\nHow to Know When Your Chocolate Is No Longer Good\nBut sometimes, things go wrong. Not every batch of chocolate is perfect. And sometimes you've simply waited too long. I've bitten into a moldy truffle before, and I don't recommend it.\nChocolate sommelier Estelle Tracy, who's held hundreds of chocolate tastings, has a few tips for knowing when your chocolate arrived in less than perfect condition‚Äîor when you've stored it wrong or too long.\nExamine the surface of the chocolate: Is there mottling? Specks? Streaks? Does the decoration on the chocolate look battered or faded? Are the chocolates uneven? In particular, if the outer shell of a bonbon separates or crumbles off of the ganache or other filling? It's not a great sign. It often denotes an old or badly tempered batch.\nDistrust whiteness: White mottling on the surface of chocolate usually denotes ‚Äúsugar bloom,‚Äù which means the chocolate has been subjected to high moisture and the sugar has risen to the surface. Aside from being ugly, your chocolate will be grainy and crumbly and a little sad.\nIf you see gray-white streaking, it may denote ‚Äúfat bloom,‚Äù meaning that the chocolate's fats have separated from the cocoa butter inside the chocolate. Less-than-fresh nuts within the chocolate may also release their fats and cause the same visual effect. The result of fat bloom, generally, is that the rest of the chocolate will have a gritty texture and be less smooth and pleasant. In the worst case, fats that have separated out from crunchy nuts or seeds might taste a little rancid. It probably won't hurt you, but it isn't great.\nLook especially on the bottom of the bonbon: The bottoms of truffles can hide their skeletons. Watch for separation between shell and filling, or an uneven surface or coloration at the bottom of a bonbon. This can be a sign of moisture or just bad tempering. ‚ÄúI always look at the bottom, because that's where it gets moldy,‚Äù said DC Chocolate Society founder Barb Genuario, during a recent tasting panel where we, alas, got a bit of musty mold in a truffle. When in doubt, cut into the bonbon with a knife and look at its interior.\nUse your nose: The nose often knows. Ingredients in old bonbons can degrade over time, especially agricultural ingredients such as fruit and nuts. Chocolate can also pick up odd flavors from the air and become unpleasant. If a bonbon smells musty, or like sour milk? That's probably how it will taste. Act accordingly.\nOrder fresh, and eat fresh: But the best way to ensure the best chocolate flavor and texture is to plan appropriately. Buy chocolate right before you eat it. And eat it when it still tastes lovely.",

    "content_text": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\nWhen a hurricane or tornado starts to form, your local weather forecasters can quickly pull up maps tracking its movement and showing where it‚Äôs headed. But have you ever wondered where they get all that information?\nThe forecasts can seem effortless, but behind the scenes, a vast network of satellites, airplanes, radar, computer models, and weather analysts are providing access to the latest data‚Äîand warnings when necessary. This data comes from analysts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, known as NOAA, and its National Weather Service.\nAtmospheric scientists Christine Wiedinmyer and Kari Bowen, a former National Weather Service forecaster, explain NOAA‚Äôs central role in most US weather forecasts.\nWhen people see a weather report on TV, what went on at NOAA to make that forecast possible?\nA lot of the weather information Americans rely on starts with real-time data collected by NOAA satellites, airplanes, weather balloons, radar, and maritime buoys, as well as weather stations around the world.\nAll of that information goes into the agency‚Äôs computers, which process the data to begin defining what‚Äôs going on in different parts of the atmosphere.\nNOAA forecasters use computer models that simulate physics and the behavior of the atmosphere, along with their own experience and local knowledge, to start to paint a picture of the weather‚Äîwhat‚Äôs coming in a few minutes or hours or days. They also use that data to project seasonal conditions out over weeks or months.\nWhen severe weather is on the way, the agency issues the official alerts you‚Äôll see in the news and on your phone.\nAll of this analysis happens before the information reaches private weather apps and TV stations.\nNo matter who you are, you can freely access that data and the analyses. In fact, a large number of private companies use NOAA data to create fancy maps and other weather products that they sell.\nIt would be extremely difficult to do all of that without NOAA.\nThe agency operates a fleet of 18 satellites that are packed with instruments dedicated to observing weather phenomena essential to predicting the weather, from how hot the land surface is to the water content of the atmosphere. Some are geostationary satellites which sit high above different parts of the US measuring weather conditions 24/7. Others orbit the planet. Many of these are operated as part of partnerships with NASA or the Air Force.\nSome private companies are starting to invest in satellites, but it would take an enormous amount of money to replicate the range of instrumentation and coverage that NOAA has in place. Satellites only last so long and take time to build, so NOAA is continually planning for the future, and using its technical expertise to develop new instruments and computer algorithms to interpret the data.\nMaritime buoys are another measuring system that would be difficult to replicate. Over 1,300 buoys across oceans around the world measure water temperature, wind, and wave height‚Äîall of which are essential for coastal warnings, as well as long-term forecasts.\nWeather observation has been around a long time. President Ulysses S. Grant created the first national weather service in the War Department in 1870. It became a civilian service in 1880 under the Department of Agriculture and is now in the Commerce Department. The information its scientists and technologists produce is essential for safety and also benefits people and industries in a lot of ways.\nCould a private company create forecasts on its own without NOAA data?\nIt would be difficult for one company to provide comprehensive weather data in a reliable way that is also accessible to the entire public.\nSome companies might be able to launch their own satellite, but one satellite only gives you part of the picture. NOAA‚Äôs weather observation network has been around for a long time and collects data from points all over the US and the oceans. Without that robust data, computer models, and the broad network of forecasters and developers, forecasting also becomes less reliable.\nAnalyzing that data is also complex. You‚Äôre not going to be able to take satellite data, run a model on a standard laptop and suddenly have a forecast.\nAnd there‚Äôs a question of whether a private company would want to take on the legal risk of being responsible for the nation‚Äôs forecasts and severe weather warnings.\nNOAA is taxpayer-funded, so it is a public good‚Äîits services provide safety and security for everyone, not just those who can pay for it.\nIf weather data was only available at a price, one town might be able to afford the weather information necessary to protect its residents, while a smaller town or a rural area across the state might not. If you‚Äôre in a tornado-prone area or coastal zone, that information can be the difference between life or death.\nIs climate data and research into the changing climate important for forecasts?\nThe Earth‚Äôs systems‚Äîits land, water, and the atmosphere‚Äîare changing, and we have to be able to assess how those changes will impact weather tomorrow, in two weeks, and far into the future.\nRising global temperatures affect weather patterns. Dryness can fuel wildfires. Forecasts have to take the changing climate into account to be accurate, no matter who is creating the forecast.\nDrought is an example. The dryness of the Earth controls how much water gets exchanged with the atmosphere to form clouds and rainfall. To have an accurate weather prediction, we need to know how dry things are at the surface and how that has changed over time. That requires long-term climate information.\nNOAA doesn‚Äôt do all of this by itself‚Äîwho else is involved?\nNOAA partners with private sector, academia, nonprofits, and many others around the world to ensure that everyone has the best information to produce the most robust weather forecasts. Private weather companies and media also play important roles in getting those forecasts and alerts out more widely to the public.\nA lot of businesses rely on accuracy from NOAA‚Äôs weather data and forecasts: aviation, energy companies, insurance, even modern tractors‚Äô precision farming equipment. The agency‚Äôs long-range forecasts are essential for managing state reservoirs to ensure enough water is saved and to avoid flooding.\nThe government agency can be held accountable in a way private businesses are not because it answers to Congress. So, the data is trustworthy, accessible and developed with the goal to protect public safety and property for everyone. Could the same be said if only for-profit companies were producing that data?",

In North America, it‚Äôs the only industrial-scale producer of the metal, which is used in not only chips, but also clean energy technologies and military equipment.\nChina, the world‚Äôs leading producer by far, had just announced new export controls on gallium, apparently in response to reports that the United States government was considering restrictions on the sale of advanced semiconductor chips to China.\nAll of a sudden, people wanted to talk to Neo. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve spoken to almost everyone‚Äù interested in producing gallium outside of China, Tsianos told Grist.\nSince Tsianos started receiving those calls, tensions over the 31st element on the periodic table‚Äîas well as the 32nd, germanium, also used in a bevy of advanced technologies‚Äîhave escalated. In December, China outright banned exports of both metals to the United States following the Biden administration‚Äôs decision to further restrict US chip exports.\nNow, several companies operating in the US and Canada are considering expanding production of the rare metals to help meet US demand. While Canadian critical minerals producers may get swept up in a new geopolitical tit-for-tat should Trump go through with his threat to impose tariffs, US metal producers could see support from the new administration, which called for prioritizing federal funding for critical minerals projects in a Day 1 executive order. Beyond the US and Canada, industry observers say China‚Äôs export ban is fueling global interest in making critical mineral supply chains more diverse so that no single country has a chokehold over materials vital for a high-tech, clean energy future.\n‚ÄúThis latest round of export bans are putting a lot of wind in the sails of critical minerals supply chain efforts, not just in the US but globally,‚Äù Seaver Wang of the Breakthrough Institute, a research center focused on technological solutions to environmental problems, told Grist.\nGallium and germanium aren‚Äôt exactly household names. But they are found in products that are indispensable to modern life‚Äîand a fossil fuel-free society. With its impressive electrical properties, gallium is used in semiconductor chips that make their way into everything from cell phones to power converters in electric vehicles to LED lighting displays. The metal is also used in the manufacturing of rare earth magnets for electric vehicles and wind turbines, in thin film solar cells, and sometimes, in commercially popular silicon solar photovoltaic cells, where it can help increase performance and extend lifespan.\nGermanium, meanwhile, is used to refract light inside fiber optic cables. In addition to helping form the backbone of the internet, the metal‚Äôs exceptional light-scattering properties make it useful for infrared lenses, semiconductor chips, and high-efficiency solar cells used by satellites.\nThere aren‚Äôt many substitutes for these two elements. Some silicon-based semiconductors lack gallium, and specialized glasses can be substituted for germanium in certain infrared technologies. Solar cells are often doped with boron instead of gallium. But these two metals have specific properties that often make them the ideal material. When it comes to clean energy, Tsianos told Grist, there are no substitutes ‚Äúwithin the material performance and cost trade-off spectrum‚Äù offered by gallium.\nBecause a little bit goes a long way, the market for both metals is small‚Äîand it‚Äôs dominated by China. In 2022, the world produced about 640 tons of low-purity gallium and a little over 200 tons of germanium, according to the US Geological Survey. In recent years, China has accounted for virtually all of the world‚Äôs low-purity gallium output and more than half of refined germanium.\nThat‚Äôs partly due to the fact that both metals are byproducts of other industries. Gallium is typically extracted from bauxite ores as they are being processed to make aluminum oxide, while zinc miners sometimes squeeze germanium out of waste produced during refining. China is a leading producer of these common metals, too‚Äîand its government has made co-extracting gallium and germanium a priority, according to Wang. ‚ÄúIt is very strategic,‚Äù he said.\nChina‚Äôs dominance of the two metals‚Äô supply chains gives it a considerable cudgel in its ongoing trade war with the US, which produces no virgin gallium and only a small amount of germanium while consuming approximately 50 tons a year of the two metals combined. A US Geological Survey study published in November found that if China implemented a total moratorium on exports of both metals, it could cost the US economy billions. Weeks after that study was published, China announced its ban.\nThe ban is so new that it‚Äôs not yet clear how US companies, or the federal government, are responding. But America‚Äôs high-tech manufacturing sector isn‚Äôt without fallback options. North of the border, Neo‚Äôs facility in Ontario stands ready to double its production of gallium, according to Tsianos. ‚ÄúWe have the capacity,‚Äù he told Grist. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre waiting for more feedstock.‚Äù\nCurrently, Neo‚Äôs only source of gallium is the semiconductor industry. Chip makers in Europe, North America, and Asia send the company their scrap, which it processes to recover high-purity gallium that feeds back into semiconductor manufacturing. But Tsianos says Neo is piloting its technology with bauxite miners around the world to create new sources of virgin gallium. The idea, he says, is that bauxite miners would do some initial processing on-site, then send low-purity gallium to Neo for further refining in Canada. Tsianos declined to name specific bauxite firms Neo is partnering with, but said the company is ‚Äúmaking progress‚Äù toward making new resources available.\nMeanwhile, in British Columbia, mining giant Teck Resources is already a leading producer of germanium outside of China. The firm‚Äôs Trail Operations refinery complex receives zinc ore from the Red Dog mine in northwest Alaska and turns it into various products, including around 20 tons of refined germanium a year, according to a US Geological Survey estimate. (Teck doesn‚Äôt disclose production volumes.)\nThat germanium is sold primarily to customers in the US, Teck spokesperson Dale Steeves told Grist. In wake of the export ban, Steeves said that the firm is now ‚Äúexamining options and market support for increasing production capacity of germanium.‚Äù\nKwasi Ampofo, the head of metals and mining at the clean energy research firm BloombergNEF, told Grist that in the near term, he would expect the US to ‚Äútry to establish new supply chain relationships‚Äù with countries that already have significant production, like Canada, to secure the gallium and germanium it needs. That may be true whether or not Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs on Canadian imports become reality. Tsianos was bullish in spite of the tariff threat, noting in an email that Neo ‚Äúremains the only industrial-scale and commercially operating Gallium facility in North America.‚Äù\n‚Äú[W]e are committed to continue serving our European, American, and Japanese customers in the semiconductor and renewable energy industries,‚Äô Tsianos added.\nSteeves told Grist that a trade war between the US and Canada would be ‚Äúa negative for the economy of both nations, disrupting the flow of essential critical minerals and increasing costs and inefficiencies on both sides of the border.‚Äù Teck, he said, ‚Äúwill continue to actively manage our sales arrangements to minimize the impact to Trail Operations.‚Äù\nWhile Canada may be the US‚Äôs best short-term option for these rare metals, farther down the line Ampofo expects to see the US take a ‚Äúrenewed interest‚Äù in recycling‚Äîparticularly of military equipment. In 2022, the Department of Defense announced it had initiated a program for recovering ‚Äúoptical-grade germanium‚Äù from old military equipment. At the time, the initiative was expected to recycle up to 3 tons of the metal each year, or roughly 10 percent of the nation‚Äôs annual demand. The Defense sub-agency responsible for the program didn‚Äôt respond to Grist‚Äôs request for comment on the program‚Äôs status.\nThere‚Äôs another small source of production capacity in the US The global metals company Umicore recycles germanium from manufacturing scrap, fiber optic cables, solar cells, and infrared optical devices at an optical materials facility in Quapaw, Oklahoma, as well as in Belgium. The company has been recycling germanium since the 1950s, a spokesperson told Grist, calling it a ‚Äúcore and historical activity at Umicore.‚Äù Umicore declined to disclose how much of the metal it recycles and wouldn‚Äôt say whether China‚Äôs export ban will impact this part of its business.\nWhile recycling is able to fill some of the nation‚Äôs gallium and germanium needs, there may be a larger source of both metals lurking in sludge ponds in central Tennessee.\nThere, in the city of Clarksville, the Netherlands-headquartered Nyrstar operates a zinc processing facility that produces wastes containing gallium and germanium. A US Department of Energy spokesperson told Grist that the company has previously partnered with Ames National Laboratory‚Äôs Critical Materials Innovation Hub to develop processes for extracting gallium, which isn‚Äôt typically produced from zinc waste.\nIn 2023, Nyrstar announced plans to build a new, $150-million facility, colocated with its existing zinc smelter in Clarksville, capable of producing 30 tons of germanium and 40 tons of gallium a year. However, the current status of the project is uncertain, with no timetable to begin construction. A spokesperson for Nyrstar told Grist the company is ‚Äúcontinu[ing] to work on and evaluate the business case‚Äù for the facility, while declining to offer additional details.\nMaking a business case to produce gallium or germanium is the central challenge for firms outside of China, experts told Grist. As Tsianos of Neo put it, these metals are a ‚Äúside hustle‚Äù that requires major up-front investment for a relatively small amount of extra revenue. Moreover, a bauxite or zinc miner‚Äôs ability to produce gallium or germanium typically hinges on the market conditions for the metal it is primarily focused on. That means ‚Äúif aluminum prices are low or the zinc prices are low, the mine or the smelter might just not operate, even if the world is sort of screaming out for more gallium or germanium,‚Äù Wang said.\nStill, there‚Äôs more economic incentive to produce these metals now than there was a few years ago. The recent geopolitical drama, Tsianos says, has caused a ‚Äúbifurcation‚Äù in the price of gallium. Outside of China, the price of the metal is now ‚Äúalmost double‚Äù what it is within the nation‚Äôs borders.\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a structural change in the market that has created a business case for outside of China production,‚Äù Tsianos said. ‚ÄúAnd it started because of the export control.‚Äù",

    "content_text": "As the United States reels from the upheaval caused by Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), hackers from countries the US considers hostile continue to wreak havoc from afar.\nNew research shows that China‚Äôs Salt Typhoon hacking group has expanded its targets list to include universities around the world and at least two more telecoms operating in the US. That brings the total number of US telecommunications networks breached by Salt Typhoon to at least 11.\nRussia‚Äôs notorious Sandworm hacking unit may be best known for its attacks on Ukraine, including multiple blackouts caused by its cyberattacks and its release of the destructive NotPetya malware. However, a hacking group within Sandworm is now taking aim at targets in Western nations, including Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US, according to research released this week by Microsoft. The group, which Microsoft calls BadPilot, is known as an ‚Äúinitial access operation,‚Äù breaching targets for the purpose of handing over access to those systems to other Sandworm hackers.\nMeanwhile, we dug into the slimy world of romance scammers who are making ill-gotten fortunes by capitalizing on the loneliness epidemic, and we dipped into the opaqueness of online advertising data that could pose a threat to US national security. Finally, we found that US funding cuts under the new Trump administration are hurting the organizations protecting children from exploitation, abuse, and human trafficking.\nAnd there's more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn‚Äôt cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\nThe Official DOGE Website Launch Was a Security Mess\nElon Musk‚Äôs DOGE finally started publishing some information about its activities on its threadbare website this week. But it wasn‚Äôt the only entity publishing on the site.\nTwo web developers, working independently, found that it is possible to push updates to the DOGE.gov domain, which claims to be an official US government website. The website uses a database that can be edited by anyone online, the experts told 404Media. To demonstrate the insecurity, they left a couple of messages on the DOGE site: ‚ÄúThis is a joke of a .gov site,‚Äù one read, while the other says: ‚ÄúTHESE ‚ÄòEXPERTS‚Äô LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.‚Äù\nThe messages stayed on the website for at least 12 hours and remained visible for some time on Friday. The DOGE website was launched in January and until this week was a single landing page containing very little information. The web experts who discovered the vulnerabilities told 404Media that the website appeared to have been ‚Äúslapped together.‚Äù\nThe website only started being populated this week‚Äîwith some figures purporting to show the size of the US government‚Äîafter Musk promised his organization would be ‚Äúmaximally transparent.‚Äù That transparency may have gone a step too far, however, with HuffPost reporting on Friday that the site included classified material.\nAs well as being insecure, the DOGE website heavily leans on X, the social media platform owned by Musk. DOGE‚Äôs homepage is a feed of its own X posts, but it also uses code that directs search engines to X.com instead of DOGE.gov, a WIRED review of the site found. ‚ÄúThis isn't usually how things are handled, and it indicates that the X account is taking priority over the actual website itself,‚Äù one developer told WIRED.\nRedNote Security Flaws Come Into Focus\nChinese TikTok alternative RedNote gained around 700,000 US users and courted American influencers when the ban on TikTok loomed in January. While many of those people may have only used RedNote for a few days, a new analysis from the University of Toronto‚Äôs Citizen Lab has highlighted how a lack of encryption could have opened up US users to ‚Äúsurveillance by any government or ISP [Internet Service Provider], and not just the Chinese government.‚Äù\nThe analysis of RedNote found a host of network security issues in both its Android and iOS apps. RedNote fetched images and videos using HTTP connections, not the industry standard and encrypted HTTPS; some versions of the app contained a vulnerability that allows an attacker to have ‚Äúread‚Äù permissions on a phone; and it ‚Äútransmitted insufficiently encrypted device metadata.‚Äù The flaws were contained in RedNote‚Äôs app and several third-party software libraries that it uses. Citizen Lab reported the issues to the companies starting in November 2024 but has not heard back from any of them.\nThe security researchers say that the vulnerabilities could risk surveillance for all users, including those in China. ‚ÄúAs the Chinese government might already have mechanisms to lawfully obtain detailed data from RedNote about their users, the issues that we found also make Chinese users especially vulnerable to surveillance by non-Chinese governments,‚Äù the research says.\nIt underscores that within China even widely used apps may not meet the same security standards as those developed outside the country. ‚ÄúApplications that are popular in China often use no encryption, proprietary encryption protocols, or use TLS without certificate validation to encrypt sensitive data,‚Äù the analysis says.\nMilitary Spy Planes Increase Surveillance Flights at US-Mexico Border\nOver the last two weeks, US spy planes have flown at least 18 missions around the Mexico border, analysis from CNN has shown. The flights mark a ‚Äúdramatic escalation in activity,‚Äù the publication reports, and come as the Trump administration has designated drug cartels as terrorist organizations and has turned the nation‚Äôs security apparatus toward deporting millions of migrants. According to CNN, various military planes, including Navy P-8s and a U-2 spy plane, were used in the operations and are capable of collecting both imagery and signals intelligence. Also this week, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has advertised new contracts that would allow it to monitor ‚Äúnegative‚Äù social media posts that people make about it.\nBacklash Mounts Against UK‚Äôs Secret Apple Encryption Order\nLast month, the UK government hit Apple with a secret order demanding the company create a way to access data stored in encrypted iCloud backups. The order, called a Technical Capability Notice and issued under the UK‚Äôs controversial 2016 surveillance law, was first reported by The Washington Post last week. Since then, there‚Äôs been a growing backlash against the demands from the UK government, with many highlighting how a change would impact the security of millions around the world.\nUS senator Ron Wyden and representative Andy Biggs have sent a letter to Tulsi Gabbard, the new director of national intelligence, saying the order undermines trust between the US and UK. ‚ÄúIf the UK does not immediately reverse this dangerous effort, we urge you to reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing with the UK,‚Äù the pair said, drawing comparisons to the Chinese-linked Salt Typhoon hacks of US telecom firms that utilized a surveillance ‚Äúbackdoor.‚Äù Since details of the order emerged, Human Rights Watch has called it an ‚Äúalarming overreach,‚Äù while 109 civil society organizations, companies, and other groups signed an open letter saying the ‚Äúdemand jeopardizes the security and privacy of millions.‚Äù",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nApple's next iPhone may launch next week. No, it's not the iPhone 17, but the long-awaited iPhone SE. This will be the fourth generation of the ‚ÄúSpecial Edition‚Äù iPhone, arriving three years after its last refresh. It's usually the cheapest in the lineup, and rumors suggest it will cost around $499, which‚Äîif true‚Äîwould be a small price bump over the $429 MSRP for the 2022 model.\nThe price may be justified because this iPhone SE may not look like its predecessor and will be a bigger phone. It's rumored to feature a 6.1-inch screen, a sizable jump from the 4.7-inch screen, with OLED in tow and Face ID, officially ditching the Home button with Touch ID baked in. It's also expected to feature USB-C and MagSafe for all your modern charging needs.\nIf its predecessor is anything to go by, it will likely be powered by Apple's A18 chipset, the same as the iPhone 16, which means this device will have access to Apple Intelligence. However, the new Camera Control button that debuted on the iPhone 16 isn't expected here, meaning there won't be any way to access Apple's Visual Intelligence feature, which lets you point the iPhone camera at objects and have Siri provide context.\nThe iPhone SE was initially expected to launch this past week after a Bloomberg report, but Bloomberg's Mark Gurman now says Apple has delayed it to the following week. Apple CEO Tim Cook seems to have confirmed this on X, saying there will be a new product launch on Wednesday, February 19.\nThe OnePlus Watch 3 Has a Big Battery\nAlso arriving next week is OnePlus‚Äô next Wear OS smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3. After a dismal launch with the original‚Äîwhich had a proprietary operating system‚ÄîOnePlus turned things around with the OnePlus Watch 2, which was one of the few full-featured smartwatches with a three-day battery life. Now it's upping the ante with a five-day battery life claim for its latest wearable. That's just by default‚Äîif you enable battery-saver mode, it can purportedly last 16 days on a single charge.\nThat's unheard of on a smartwatch of this type, and the innovation is two-pronged. OnePlus is one of the few Wear OS smartwatch makers utilizing a dual-engine architecture, with Wear OS and the Snapdragon W5 chipset running the intense graphical tasks and the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) powered by an upgraded BES2800 MCU chipset handling all the smaller background tasks. This is paired with a new silicon-carbon battery technology the company just introduced in the OnePlus 13, which allows for denser batteries that don't need to be thicker. Hence, this watch has a big 631-mAh battery cell (its predecessor had a 500-mAh cell) without a drastic size increase.\nIt retains the stainless steel casing, but now there's a titanium alloy bezel around the screen for extra protection, and the 2D sapphire crystal display is brighter, too. It'll come in Emerald Titanium and Obsidian Titanium, with more details about features, specs, and price to come on February 18.\nNinja‚Äôs Ice Cream Maker Now Does Soft-Serve\nSoft-serve ice cream at home is an odd holy grail‚Äîusually the province of expensive commercial machines that churn and swirl air into fast-freezing ice cream. People do weird stuff to mimic it. Very few home machines have tried or succeeded. Well, into the breach jumps Ninja with its new $350 Ninja Swirl Creami ice cream machine, released with much fanfare this week.\nThe Swirl is the follow-up to Ninja‚Äôs previous-generation Creami ice cream maker, which inspired sellouts and TikTok pandemonium after its release in 2022. The Swirl, like the original Creami, lets you pre-freeze any recipe you want‚Äîcanned mangos, bananas, Campari and OJ, you do you‚Äîand turn it into ice cream, froyo, or sorbet. But alongside hard ice cream, the new excitement on the Swirl is the addition of six soft-serve settings ranging from traditional to regional variants such as the Midwest‚Äôs beloved frozen custard and a Dole-inspired fruit whip.\nAccording to Ninja, the soft-serve option relies on a ‚ÄúCreamerizer Paddle‚Äù to aerate and texture the soft-serve swirl. And after online health nuts kept trading low-calorie protein ice-cream recipes for the Creami, the Swirl now also includes an alarmingly named protein ice-cream setting called ‚ÄúCreamiFit.‚Äù Look, I love a good soft-serve machine. But the main thing I‚Äôve learned this week is that whoever names new products at Ninja has the best and most hilarious job on earth. ‚ÄîMatthew Korfhage\nWacom Revamps the Intuos Pro Tablet\nIt‚Äôs been eight years since Wacom redesigned the Intuos Pro‚Äîthe company‚Äôs digital drawing tablet for creatives‚Äîbut the time has finally come for a revamp. Like its predecessor, it comes in three sizes: small, medium, or large. The tablets are now thinner and more compact. Each one also has a larger drawing area, while still maintaining a 16:9 aspect ratio to complement most displays. Despite the slimmer profile, it sports longer battery life of 16 hours. With Bluetooth, you can connect the tablet to up to three devices (one via USB and two wirelessly) and use the mechanical switch to toggle between each one. It‚Äôs compatible with both Mac and Windows.\nWacom also moved the ExpressKeys and touch buttons from the side to the top of the tablet, and swapped the touch rings with dials that deliver tactile feedback. These changes are specifically meant to limit any accidental movements or input while drawing or editing‚Äîregardless of whether you‚Äôre right- or left-handed. They come preinstalled with shortcuts too, but you can customize your own depending on the app you're using. Each tablet also includes the existing Pro Pen 3, which comes with programmable shortcut buttons, customizable weight and grip thickness, and interchangeable nibs. It doesn‚Äôt require batteries or charging.\nThe new Intuos Pro is already on sale, with the small size starting at $250, the medium costing $380, and the large hitting $500. (They seem to already be out of stock at Wacom's webstore.) Each tablet comes with a free trial of Clip Studio Paint, Capture One, and MASV, as well as Wacom‚Äôs Yufiy software, which embeds a digital micromark to your work. ‚ÄîBrenda Stolyar\nGoogle‚Äôs Family Link Redesign\nGoogle's parental controls app, Family Link, got a big redesign this week. There's now a dedicated Screen Time tab that puts all related screen-time management tools in one place, and in the Controls tab, Google says it has ‚Äústreamlined key controls‚Äù to make it easier and faster to manage privacy settings and content filters.\nAlso new is School Time, which debuted for the Fitbit Ace LTE and Samsung Galaxy Watch for Kids as a way to minimize distractions on smartwatches during school hours. Now this is available on Android phones and tablets as well via Family Link. It can limit phone functionality and silence notifications, and you can choose what apps are accessible. Google says in the coming months, it will add the ability for parents to approve contacts for their kids to call and text on Android phones.\nAnd speaking of Google, the company sent out invites this week for its Google I/O developer conference in Mountain View, California: May 20 and 21. This event is usually where we'll hear more details about the upcoming version of Android‚ÄîAndroid 16‚Äîalong with updates to the Gemini voice assistant and all of Google's other software products, from Wear OS to Android Auto.\nMonitor Your Meals With Lifesum‚Äôs AI Tracking\nIf you‚Äôre diabetic or trying to get your cholesterol levels down, tracking your meals is probably the most difficult part. What‚Äôs in there, exactly? How much protein, fiber, or calories are you really ingesting? Companies like Oura have begun experimenting with using AI to analyze your meals. But the more ways you can log your food intake, the easier it is to stick to it.\nThis week, the nutrition app Lifesum (iOS, Android) introduced multimodal AI-powered meal tracking via photos, text, or barcodes. Take a picture of your meal, upload to the app, and advanced image recognition will quickly break it down and log it for you. Should you choose to describe it via voice or text, language processing models will do the same. You can also scan barcodes for instant nutritional information. We‚Äôve come a long way from counting the points in a handful of popcorn, that‚Äôs for sure. ‚ÄîAdrienne So\nAdobe‚Äôs Firefly Generative AI Video App Is Here\nAdobe claims its Firefly app‚Äîwhich launched in beta this past week‚Äîemploys the ‚Äúfirst commercially safe AI video generation model‚Äù to market. It was only available within Adobe Premiere Pro before, allowing you to use text prompts or images to generate videos, but now Firefly is accessible as a web app.\nWhat the company means by ‚Äúsafe‚Äù is that its Firefly Video Model injects a watermark to signify parts of the video that have been generated by AI for transparency. Adobe also says Firefly was trained on licensed videos, meaning the generated video content is safe to use without worrying about intellectual property theft. Now you can just worry about your job being replaced in a few years once it can generate full-length videos!\nAlongside the new web app, Adobe also has new subscription options (of course). The Firefly Standard plan is $10 per month with 2,000 credits, enough for 20 five-second AI videos in 1080p. Firefly Pro upgrades that to 7,000 credits, which equals up to 70 five-second 1080p videos for $30 per month. There will be a Firefly Premium plan in the future that offers even more credits for ‚Äúhigh-volume creators,‚Äù but no details have been shared yet.\nApple TV Comes to Android\nAndroid users pining for Ted Lasso on the go had good news this week, as the Apple TV app is finally available for Android phones and tablets. Not to be confused with the streaming box of the same name, the Apple TV app serves up the brand‚Äôs Apple TV Plus subscription streaming service, a formidable player in the crowded streaming marketplace, thanks to Lasso and other popular originals like The Morning Show and the addictive sci-fi thriller, Severance, now in its long-awaited second season.\nOther enticing Apple TV content includes critically acclaimed original movies like Coda and Martin Scorsese‚Äôs marathon period film, Killers of the Flower Moon, and live sports like Friday Night Baseball, Sunday Night Soccer, and access to MLS Season Pass (for an additional fee).\nApple TV Plus has been available across all major smart TVs and streaming devices for years, but in that oh-so-Apple way, the app has been conspicuously unavailable for Android users since its launch in 2019. The biggest advantage for Androidian Apple TV Plus subscribers may be the ability to download Apple TV series and movies for offline viewing, a feature most other major streamers provide. ‚ÄîRyan Waniata\nPSA: Amazon Is Ending Kids+ Support for iOS and Android\nAmazon announced last year that Amazon Kids+ would no longer be available for new customers on iOS or Android devices, and would eventually be going away for everyone on those platforms. That day is rapidly approaching. On March 10, Amazon will no longer support the Kids+ app for iOS and Android. It's unclear exactly what this means, but the message is clear in spirit if not letter: Amazon Kids+ requires an Amazon device like a Kindle, Fire Tablet, Echo Speaker, or Fire TV. ‚ÄîScott Gilbertson",

    "content_text": "Since Mike Tyson's Punch-Out was released on the NES in 1987, millions of players have undertaken millions of digital matches against one of the hardest video game bosses ever: Tyson himself (or, later, the reskinned ‚ÄúMr. Dream‚Äù).\nOnly a small percentage of those players could survive Tyson's flurry of instant-knockdown uppercuts and emerge victorious with the undisputed World Video Boxing Association championship. Even fewer had fast enough fingers to take out Tyson in the first round.\nIn all this time, no one has been able to register a TKO on Tyson in less than two minutes on the ever-present in-game clock (which runs roughly three times as quickly as a real-time clock). At least that was true until last weekend, when popular speedrunner and speedrun historian Summoning Salt pulled off a 1:59.97 knockout after what he says were ‚Äú75,000 attempts over nearly five years.‚Äù\nBreaking the storied two-minute barrier on Tyson is a matter of both incredible skill and incredibly unlikely luck. As Summoning Salt himself started documenting in a 2017 video, getting the quickest possible Tyson TKO requires throwing 21 ‚Äúframe perfect‚Äù punches throughout the fight, each within a one-sixtieth-of-a-second window. Punch too early and those punches do slightly less damage, making the fight take just a bit longer. Too late and Tyson will throw up a block, negating the punch entirely.\nA top-notch Tyson speedrun also requires well-timed dodging and ducking of Tyson's own punches so that Little Mac (the player character) can get back into counterpunching position as quickly as possible. Summoning Salt says he was just seven frames off of perfection in this regard, which cost about 0.35 in-game seconds over the course of the fight.\nEven with that nearly unmatched execution, though, Summoning Salt's record-breaking run would have fallen well short if not for unreasonable amounts of luck from the game itself. As Bismuth explains in a 2024 video, Tyson can pause for anywhere between a fraction of a second and up to eight seconds between punches.\nGetting the longest of those delays can hamper any chance of beating Tyson in the first round. But for his sub-two-minute TKO, Summoning Salt needed almost all of those pauses to luckily come down at the minimum of eight frames (~0.4 seconds on the in-game clock).\nSummoning Salt says Tyson here gave him a \"perfect pattern\" during his first phase of endless uppercuts, something that happens only 1 in 1,600 bouts. And later in the fight, the game's random-number generator cooperated by adding only an extra 16 frames of delay (~0.8 in-game seconds) compared to a \"perfect\" run. Combined, Summoning Salt estimates that Tyson will only punch this quickly once every 7,000 to 10,000 attempts.\n\"It's over,\" Summoning Salt said live on Twitch when the record-setting match was finished, in a surprisingly even tone that came over what sounds very much like a dropped controller. ‚ÄúI thought I'd be a lot more excited about this. Holy shit, dude! It's fucking over ‚Ä¶ Dude, am I dreaming right now? ‚Ä¶ I'm sorry I'm so quiet. I'm kind of in shock right now that that just happened.‚Äù\nWith his near-perfect combination of both skill and luck, Summoning Salt's new record surpasses his own previous world record of precisely 2:00.00 on the in-game clock. That mark, set just eight months ago, was just three frames off of displaying 1:59 on the in-game timer for the first time.\nSummoning Salt was also the first runner to break the 2:01 barrier on Tyson in 2020, a feat he has since replicated just 15 times over tens of thousands of attempts. \"There's essentially no difference between all of those [2:00.xx] fights and this one, except I got better luck from Tyson on this fight,\" he writes. \"Finally, after nearly half a decade, the 1:59 has happened.\"\nIronically, just before posting his first 2:00.xx fight in 2020, Summoning Salt posted a video discussing in part just how difficult it was for speedrunners to beat Matt Turk's 2007 record of 2:13 on Tyson. \"For years it was just this impossibly fast time that the top players just couldn't get close to,\" Summoning Salt said at the time. \"Of course, other top players fought Tyson years later, but their best efforts came up short ‚Ä¶ they couldn't touch it. It stood alone.\"\nSummoning Salt is now just over a second off of the tool-assisted speedrun record of 1:58.61, which uses emulated gameplay to fight a theoretical \"perfect\" bout every time. But after spending years on what he writes \"is the greatest gaming achievement I have ever accomplished,\" Summoning Salt seems ready to hang up his virtual boxing gloves for good.\n\"I have no plans to ever improve this time,\" he writes. \"It will be beaten by somebody one day, likely by matching this fight and then getting better luck in phase 3. I have no interest in competing for that but am extremely proud to have gotten the first sub-2 ever on Mike Tyson.\"\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has frozen all of its election security work and is reviewing everything it has done to help state and local officials secure their elections for the past eight years, WIRED has learned. The move represents the first major example of the country‚Äôs cyberdefense agency accommodating President Donald Trump‚Äôs false claims of election fraud and online censorship.\nIn a memo sent Friday to all CISA employees and obtained by WIRED, CISA‚Äôs acting director, Bridget Bean, said she was ordering ‚Äúa review and assessment‚Äù of every position at the agency related to election security and countering mis- and disinformation, ‚Äúas well as every election security and [mis-, dis-, and malinformation] product, activity, service, and program that has been carried out‚Äù since the federal government designated election systems as critical infrastructure in 2017.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at ericgeller.01.\n‚ÄúCISA will pause all elections security activities until the completion of this review,‚Äù Bean added. The agency is also cutting off funding for these activities at the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing & Analysis Center, a group funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that has served as a coordinating body for the elections community.\nIn her memo, Bean confirmed that CISA had, as first reported by Politico, placed employees ‚Äúinitially identified to be associated with the elections security activities and the MDM program‚Äù on administrative leave on February 7.\n‚ÄúIt is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,‚Äù she told employees in the memo.\nWhile Bean is temporarily leading CISA, she is officially the agency‚Äôs executive director, its top career position. CISA‚Äôs first director created the executive-director role to provide continuity during political transitions. Previously, Bean was a Trump appointee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency during his first term.\nIn justifying CISA‚Äôs internal review, which will conclude on March 6, Bean pointed to Trump‚Äôs January 20 executive order on ‚Äúending federal censorship.‚Äù Conservatives have argued that CISA censored their speech by coordinating with tech companies to identify online misinformation in 2020, during the final year of Trump‚Äôs first term. CISA has denied conducting any censorship, and the US Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit over the government‚Äôs work. But in the wake of the backlash, CISA halted most conversations with tech platforms about online mis- and disinformation.\nCISA and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nSince 2017, state and local election officials have relied on CISA‚Äôs expertise and resources‚Äîas well as its partnerships with other agencies‚Äîto improve their physical and digital security. Through on-site consultations and online guidance, CISA has helped election administrators secure voting infrastructure against hackers, harden polling places against active shooters, and create polling-place backup plans to deal with ballot shortages or power outages.\nElection supervisors have always struggled to overcome serious funding challenges, but in recent years, their jobs have become even more stressful as intense voter scrutiny has given way to harassment and even death threats. Election officials of both parties have repeatedly praised CISA for its apolitical support of their work, saying the agency‚Äôs recommendations and free security services have been critical in boosting their own efforts.\nBut that bipartisan accord began fraying after the 2020 election, as some conservative election officials started criticizing the agency for its focus on mis- and disinformation. Congressional Republicans joined the fray as well, calling CISA ‚Äúthe nerve center of the federal government‚Äôs domestic surveillance and censorship operations on social media.‚Äù Their rhetoric echoed Trump‚Äôs own history of election denialism, which involved false claims of rigged voting machines and mass voter fraud and culminated in Trump supporters‚Äô January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\nWith conservatives pushing to axe CISA‚Äôs election security mission, Trump‚Äôs election last November virtually guaranteed an end to that program, and employees have been bracing for retaliation against the people who participated in that work.\nBean‚Äôs memo indicates that CISA‚Äôs internal review will cover every agency position related to election security, as well as performance plans for employees involved in that work; all support services provided to the election community; and all election security guidance and publications. Bean wrote that CISA will describe any steps necessary to ‚Äúcorrect any activities identified as past misconduct by the Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech,‚Äù including eliminating programs or roles.\nAfter CISA completes its review, the agency will submit a report to the White House addressing how it plans to ‚Äúdeliver a more focused provision of services for elections security activities,‚Äù Bean told employees. The report will focus on three goals: streamlining the election security services that CISA offers to state and local governments, ensuring that its activities align with its new ‚Äúmandate to refocus‚Äù on its core mission, and removing ‚Äúall personnel, contracts, grants, programs, products, services, and activities‚Äù that conflict with Trump‚Äôs anti-censorship directive or exceed CISA‚Äôs authorities.\nIt is unclear if White House officials or DHS secretary Kristi Noem directly ordered Bean to launch the election security investigation or if she independently determined that Trump‚Äôs executive order necessitated it. The January 20 directive does instruct the attorney general to work with other agency leaders to investigate Biden-administration activities that are ‚Äúinconsistent‚Äù with Trump‚Äôs vow to end online censorship, but it makes no mention of activities prior to Biden‚Äôs term, including CISA‚Äôs 2020 election work.",

    "content_text": "A Manhattan Federal Court judge on Friday extended the temporary restraining order that bars staffers from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency from accessing US Treasury Department data‚Äîwhich attorneys general from New York and other blue states have slammed as an unlawful threat to privacy‚Äîwhile she considers whether to impose a longer-term injunction.\nAfter hearing some two hours of arguments, Judge Jeannette A. Vargas told lawyers for New York and allied states, and their opponents from the Department of Justice, ‚ÄúI do find good cause to extend the TRO as modified.‚Äù Vargas said she would soon issue her decision, but not today, to ‚Äúgive the court time to consider‚Äù the issues.\nWhile the proceeding largely maintained the status quo, it also lifted the veil on just how little is known about DOGE‚Äôs access to information‚Äîand where it went.\nWhen Vargas asked Jeffrey Oestericher, the Justice Department attorney representing Trump, on Friday whether any DOGE-accessed information had been shared outside of the Treasury Department, he said: ‚ÄúThe short answer on that is we don‚Äôt presently know.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre performing a forensic analysis. What we can tell from the forensic analysis thus far is there were emails sent outside Treasury,‚Äù Oestericher said. ‚ÄúWe do not know [the] content.‚Äù\nVargas asked: Wasn‚Äôt this problematic from a privacy standpoint?\n‚ÄúThe short answer is no,‚Äù Oestericher said.\n‚ÄúDuring this time that the DOGE team members had access to this information, there were extensive mitigation efforts in place to prevent this precise harm.‚Äù\nBut Oestericher admitted at another point, ‚ÄúWe candidly admit that there was some measure of increased risk, but we took all appropriate mitigation measures to mitigate that risk as much as possible.‚Äù\nVargas‚Äô decision came six days after New York and allied litigants were granted a temporary restraining order that ultimately prohibited the Treasury Department from giving DOGE hires and special government employees access to sensitive data and computer systems. Donald Trump tapped Elon Musk to head DOGE, an agency the president created under the auspices of rooting out fraud and governmental waste‚Äîdespite a dearth of evidence indicating fraud.\nIn issuing that temporary restraining order early February 8, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said that the states suing Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would ‚Äúface irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief.‚Äù\nEngelmayer noted that Treasury‚Äôs new policy, enacted at Trump‚Äôs direction, appears to allegedly ‚Äú[expand] access to the paytment systems of the Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS) to political appointees and ‚Äòspecial government employees.‚Äô‚Äù\nThis, Engelmayer reasoned, represented a ‚Äúrisk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.‚Äù\nEngelmayer also said in his written decision that the states suing over Treasury‚Äôs policy change ‚Äúhave shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims, with the States‚Äô statutory claims presenting as particularly strong.‚Äù\nThe complaint against Trump and Bessent repeatedly cited WIRED‚Äôs reporting that revealed how a 25-year-old engineer named Marko Elez, with ties to Musk, enjoyed read and write access to two Treasury Department systems responsible for virtually all payments made by the federal government. Tom Krause‚Äîwho is on the DOGE team despite being CEO of Cloud Software Group‚Äîwas also granted access to these capabilities.\nTwo sources told WIRED that Elez‚Äôs privileges allowed him not just to read but also write code for two of the most sensitive US government computer systems. These include the Payment Automation Manager and Secure Payment System at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). These systems, which are kept on a secure mainframe, control government payments that total more than 20 percent of the US economy, WIRED previously reported.\nIn court papers filed February 13, New York and allies allege that Trump and his Treasury Department don‚Äôt even contest that states have a ‚Äúclear and reasonable interest in protecting their confidential bank account numbers and other sensitive financial information, including details and amounts of payments, from unauthorized disclosure.‚Äù But this information was disclosed to two DOGE members, they claim, violating ‚Äúnumerous laws and regulations.‚Äù\nNew York and other states argued in that same filing that BFS‚Äôs development of ‚Äúmitigation strategies‚Äù to reduce risk was testament to the ‚Äúsubstantial and imminent‚Äù danger. They say that at least on one occasion, Elez was ‚Äúmistakenly provided with ‚Äòread/write permissions instead of read-only.‚Äô‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut even with the more restricted ‚Äòread-only‚Äô access, Elez still had ‚Äòthe ability to view and query information and data‚Äô; in other words, he had access to the States‚Äô sensitive financial information.‚Äù Despite the fact that Elez resigned when asked for comment by The Wall Street Journal about racist social media posts, the government didn‚Äôt provide any reassurance that he didn‚Äôt participate in improper activity, New York and its allies alleged. (Meanwhile, Musk suggested in a post on X, his social media platform, that Elez would be rehired, writing: ‚ÄúHe will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.‚Äù)\nAndrew Amer, an attorney in New York state attorney general Letitia James‚Äô office, said Friday that Elez and Krause ‚Äúhave no lawful job duty to access this information.‚Äù\nDespite the government‚Äôs insistence that Elez was in a ‚Äúsandbox environment‚Äù when he had access to the code, which they insist minimized risk, Amer said that wasn‚Äôt all that comforting.\n‚ÄúWe know that the same engineer took screenshots of the data in the data system and that he may have given those screenshots to his supervisor,‚Äù Amer said.\nAmer said the Justice Department‚Äôs insistence that Krause only had ‚Äúover-the-shoulder access‚Äù didn‚Äôt inspire much confidence either.\n‚ÄúThe fact that we don‚Äôt know if any information went beyond Treasury is a red flag that causes concern about the ethics issue,‚Äù Amer said. ‚ÄúThis is especially important, as we do have people, especially Mr. Krause, who is simultaneously employed elsewhere outside Treasury.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou have somebody who‚Äôs been given access to source code within the bureau whose other job is CEO of one of the world‚Äôs largest software companies.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe are here because the states‚Äô banking information has been accessed‚Äî that has happened,‚Äù Amer said at another point in court. ‚ÄúWe know that the people who accessed it have been somewhat careless in the way they handled it.‚Äù\nAmer also rejected any notion that DOGE acolytes‚Äô access was normal. ‚ÄúThis was not a Treasury function, this was building a new automated process to apply an ideological litmus test to funding requests. There‚Äôs nothing typical or normal in terms of Treasure functions about that.‚Äù\nTrump‚Äôs camp has contended that his opponents are trying to thwart the White House‚Äôs right ‚Äúto exercise politically accountable oversight of agency activities and to implement the president‚Äôs policy priorities.‚Äù\nTreasury Department officials are responsible for liaising with the United States DOGE Service, which needs to have access to BFS systems, they argue, ‚Äúto perform their Presidentially-directed mandate of maximizing efficiency and productivity, including ensuring data and payment integrity with respect to the 1.2 billion transactions and over $5 trillion in outlays handled by BFS,‚Äù they said in court papers.\nRed states including Florida, Georgia, and Alabama have also entered the fray to show support for Trump. They contend in court papers that blue states‚Äô opposition to DOGE meddling is unconstitutional. ‚ÄúThis case involves an unprecedented assault on the separation of powers and the President‚Äôs authority under Article II of the Constitution,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúUltimately, Plaintiffs here are upset because one set of bureaucrats in the Executive Branch have access to data that they believe only other bureaucrats in the Executive Branch should have access to.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThis type of fiddling around with the President‚Äôs prerogatives asks this Court to insert itself into core Executive decision-making regarding policy and personnel. The President is working to combat what former President Biden‚Äôs administration identified, at minimum, as hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud,‚Äù they wrote.",

    "content_text": "This morning, workers at the US Treasury Department‚Äôs Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) received an email announcing that Tom Krause, a software executive and Elon Musk ally, was \"appointed to perform the delegated duties of the Fiscal Assistant Secretary.‚Äù That role was previously occupied by David Lebryk, who resigned after refusing to allow Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to sensitive systems within the Treasury Department. Though it had been previously reported that Krause, who had been called a special government employee, had obtained Lebryk‚Äôs old position, the email also notably states that Krause is ‚Äúcurrently the CEO of Cloud Software Group.‚Äù\n‚ÄúTom brings more than 20 years of experience leading, building, and positioning software and technology companies for value and long-term success,‚Äù the email reads. ‚ÄúTom is currently the CEO of Cloud Software Group which manages and operates multiple mission critical enterprise software businesses.‚Äù\nIn response to questions from WIRED, a representative for the company said that ‚ÄúTom is the CEO of Cloud Software Group‚Äù and forwarded a copy of an email sent to the company‚Äôs employees last week in which Krause wrote, ‚Äúin addition to my duties as CEO of Cloud Software Group, I am advising the US Department of Treasury as a ‚Äòspecial government employee.‚Äô I am honored to serve our country.‚Äù Critics believe Krause retaining his job in addition to serving in the government could be a massive conflict of interest.\nTreasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cloud Software Group did not respond to questions about whether Krause would continue to draw a salary from the company during his time with the Treasury.\nIn an affidavit filed Thursday in the lawsuit Alliance for Retired Americans v. Department of the Treasury, Krause wrote, ‚ÄúWhile in this Treasury role, I have also maintained my employment as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Cloud Software Group, Inc., which [is] a privately held company comprised of several enterprise software businesses. This arrangement has been approved by Treasury‚Äôs ethics office, who determined, based on my role as an SGE, that this arrangement was permissible.\" In the same affidavit, Krause said, ‚ÄúI have not yet assumed those duties\" as Fiscal Assistant Secretary.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee that wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at velliott88.18.\n‚ÄúI cannot think of another example where this has occurred, but I do think it's part of a broader pattern of the erasure of conflicts of interests within the federal government,‚Äù says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. ‚ÄúFederal employees can't take more than a $25 gift from someone who might be trying to influence their actions. On the other hand, their bosses are simultaneously running private companies while also running parts of the government that affect their businesses.‚Äù\nTreasury in particular, he says, could pose a conflict of interest across industries because ‚Äúit affects everything.‚Äù And any alleged conflicts of interest may not be limited to just Krause‚Äôs own company. ‚ÄúThere is a network of people coming from Silicon Valley and corporate America now that are working together,‚Äù Moynihan says. ‚ÄúAnd so it's not just about the conflict of interest he might have with his business, but the way in which he's situated to help that broader network that are now effectively running the government.‚Äù\nAlthough Treasury and White House officials have gone back and forth about DOGE‚Äôs access to Treasury payment systems, WIRED has reported that, at one point, DOGE had both read and write access. Marko Elez, one of a number of young men identified by WIRED who have little to no government experience but are associated with DOGE, was granted read and write privileges on two of the most sensitive systems in the US government: the Payment Automation Manager and Secure Payment System at the BFS, an agency that, according to Treasury records, paid out $5.45 trillion in fiscal year 2024. (An affidavit filed in the same Alliance for Retired Americans v. Department of the Treasury lawsuit by a Bureau of the Fiscal Service official claims Elez only had read and write access to the SPS.)\nA federal judge last week granted an order to temporarily restrict DOGE staffers from accessing and changing Treasury payment system information, following a lawsuit alleging that the Treasury Department provided ‚ÄúElon Musk or other individuals associated with DOGE‚Äù access to the payment systems and that this access violated federal privacy laws. The order, however, specifically provided a carve-out for Krause and Elez, though their access was supposed to be restricted to ‚Äúread only.‚Äù\nA subsequent order blocked DOGE members from access to payment systems. In response to the Trump administration‚Äôs objections that the order would block people with legitimate need to access systems, such as the Treasury secretary and contractors, the order was loosened to note that ‚Äúthe Secretary of the Treasury and other Senate-confirmed senior Treasury Officers are not prohibited from accessing Treasury's payment systems.‚Äù This would appear to leave Krause barred from access to the very systems the Fiscal Assistant Secretary oversees.\nLast week, the threat intelligence team at one of the Treasury‚Äôs agencies recommended that DOGE members be monitored as an ‚Äúinsider threat,‚Äù WIRED reported. An internal email sent to the BFS‚Äôs IT division and others called DOGE staff‚Äôs access to federal payments systems ‚Äúthe single greatest insider threat risk the Bureau of the Fiscal Service has ever faced.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe are running out of ways to say ‚Äòunprecedented,‚Äô‚Äù says Moynihan.\nEarlier today, the Office of the Inspector General at the Treasury said it would be auditing the government‚Äôs payment systems in response to concerns raised by Democratic senators about DOGE‚Äôs access. It will also be examining the past two years of payments to evaluate whether any have been fraudulent, which Musk has alleged.\nMatt Giles contributed reporting.",

    "content_text": "When news first broke about Elon Musk‚Äôs tech takeover of the United States government, a number of people who had spent years trying to transform federal IT practices were surprisingly hopeful. Maybe, they dreamed, Elon Musk and his team at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would provide a long-needed jolt to an intransigent and antediluvian bureaucracy.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beyond debate that a more aggressive approach was necessary if we were ever going to make any progress in our lifetimes,‚Äù says Mikey Dickerson, who was the founding administrator of the United States Digital Service, which has now been refashioned into Musk‚Äôs US DOGE Service. (He left in 2017, before Trump was inaugurated the first time.) Dickerson says the executive order that Trump issued on day one of his second term, which established DOGE as a temporary organization within the government, was actually something he would have liked to see in Obama‚Äôs founding charter for the agency. He particularly liked the paragraph that forced agencies to give USDS teams access to systems and records. ‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt have been a magic bullet, but it would have created a strong presumption that they needed to cooperate,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe didn't really have that, so it was pretty much optional whether anybody wanted to work with us.‚Äù\nSome of the outgoing leaders of the government tech team, who were both proud of their accomplishments and frustrated by their inability to truly transform the opaque mess of federal IT, shared similar hopes. Outgoing USDS director Mina Hsiang called DOGE‚Äôs power ‚Äúa tremendous opportunity.‚Äù Former federal chief information officer Clare Martorana expressed excitement that the order would force agencies to share budget data with DOGE, seeing it as an opportunity to pull back the shroud and finally figure out where these agencies hide waste. This information could inform wise decisions on what needs cutting, with the North Star being value to the American people. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying very hard to be optimistic about it,‚Äù she told me.\nBefore the inauguration, Jennifer Pahlka, former deputy chief technology officer under Obama and one of the USDS founders, wrote an essay called ‚ÄúBringing Elon to a Knife Fight,‚Äù which summed up the feeling: ‚ÄúA lot of the government tech community ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt see DOGE as their savior, but they are feeling vindicated after years of shouting into the void.‚Äù\nIf any of those former officials really believed that Musk was going to run with the opportunity to constructively reform the government, those fantasies have now been shattered. Musk and DOGE brought in a team of young techies and experienced executives who could have seized the moment to focus on making government work better. But to date they have used their access and power to indiscriminately drain the federal workforce and defund programs for ideological reasons, seemingly without giving even casual thought to the consequences. Yes, Musk professes to be a champion of the people against the bureaucratic state: ‚ÄúIf the bureaucracy is in charge, then what meaning does democracy actually have?‚Äù he asked during a bizarre Oval Office appearance this week while Trump looked on and Musk‚Äôs 4-year-old son X fidgeted. But the actions actually taken by DOGE don‚Äôt sync with this sentiment, especially when the moves seem to contravene measures passed by Congress and signed into law. That‚Äôs not terribly democratic. ‚ÄúI think government is a good thing, and it needed massive transformation, far more quickly than anyone in political leadership had any appetite for,‚Äù Pahlka tells me. ‚ÄúSince we didn't do it, this seems to be what we're getting.‚Äù\nAnn Lewis, who until late last year headed the Technology Transformation Services, an agency devoted to using modern tech to make government accessible to its citizens, also tried at first to see the DOGE takeover in a positive light. It didn‚Äôt take long for that light to dim. ‚ÄúThe model of bringing in private-sector people who have a fresh perspective and skills and who want to help is a great idea,‚Äù she tells me. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre not seeing people from the private sector with lots of experience who want to understand how everything works.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs overstating the case to describe Pahlka, Dickerson, and Lewis as disillusioned, because it was obvious all along that Musk‚Äôs dreams didn‚Äôt involve things like single sign-on for government services, or direct tax filing, or creating a universal feedback loop so agencies could better serve their constituents. These are all examples of the kinds of efficiencies that serve people no matter where they stand politically. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe for a second that they‚Äôre taking seriously the idea of making government more efficient,‚Äù says Dickerson. ‚ÄúIf you were trying to do that, then you would start with the big programs, not these little things around the edges like USAID. There‚Äôs like 12 people outside Washington who could have told you what that agency was three weeks ago. And why would you need access to the Treasury payment system? No one thought there was anything wrong with the Treasury payment system. That‚Äôs for some other purpose.‚Äù\nTo be fair, Musk does make a case for read-only access to the Treasury system: It can help to identify fraud and waste. (The case for DOGE‚Äôs youth squad to have the ability to change the system is something else.) During the Oval Office appearance, he told horror stories of federal employees possibly enriching themselves with tens of millions of dollars. But he hasn‚Äôt provided evidence and doesn‚Äôt seem to be referring cases for prosecution. And defining waste sometimes depends on who‚Äôs assessing the claim. A number of his charges about supposedly illegal expenditures from USAID have turned out to be misrepresentations of reasonable grants, some of which weren‚Äôt made by that agency at all! Yet he called USAID ‚Äúa criminal organization‚Äù and said it was ‚Äútime for it to die.‚Äù Considering that Musk rails against the bureaucracy for wielding unelected power, that‚Äôs an odd justification from an unelected official negating the will of elected representatives. (A federal judge has temporarily blocked a decision to put thousands of agency workers on leave.) DOGE did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\nOne goal Musk doesn‚Äôt hide is cutting the federal workforce to the bone‚Äîeven if it means that critical talent goes out the door. Lewis told me she heard from friends at USDS and people she hired at TTS about their interactions with DOGE people. ‚ÄúThese are people with decades of experience, like an AI executive from Netflix, or an early Microsoft engineer,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThey were in 15-minute interviews with DOGE staff, who are almost entirely in their twenties, white, male, and inexperienced. They were asking people who used to be on the level of their former boss‚Äôs boss‚Äôs boss, ‚ÄòWhat are your skills? Why do you think your projects are important? And who do you think we should fire?‚Äô When these senior engineers answered the questions and told the DOGE staffers about things like software architecture and product management and system monitoring and production system scaling, the 20-year-olds hadn't heard of these things, because they haven't had that experience in their own tech careers yet. So the experience was humiliating, and I think intended to drive people out.‚Äù\nMinutes before my conversation with Lewis this week, DOGE began attempting to fire people at TTS. ‚ÄúThere are plenty of arguments for smaller government, but cutting people with no thought or care to what skills they have?‚Äù she asks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs taking a machete to something as opposed to making surgical cuts that try and improve the functioning of the government.‚Äù\nFor those who spent a good chunk of their lives pushing for reform, and ultimately concluded that only radical measures could tame the bureaucratic beast, Elon Musk‚Äôs youth crusade represents a heartbreaking squandering of a generational opportunity. When Dickerson recruited for USDS, he would say to young techies, ‚ÄúOnly come here if you want the opportunity to work on the most important problems in the country. I guarantee you if you come here for that, you‚Äôre going to get it. If you come here for anything else, I promise you nothing.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs hard to determine what Musk‚Äôs junior minions are thinking of their work. (If you are one of them, please ping me at stevenlevy.72 on Signal. I promise to listen.) They may well believe that they are purging evil from a deep-state conspiracy that deserves to die. But as a matter of fact, they are contributing to efforts to shut down Head Start programs, halting initiatives to monitor potential global pandemics in Africa, and creating the conditions to restore indefensible late fees on credit cards. By the time they‚Äôre done, the rest of us might be pining for the good old sclerotic bureaucracy.\nTime Travel\nIn 2016 I interviewed Mikey Dickerson and his second-in-command Haley Van Dyck about the progress of the US Digital Service. Among other topics, we discussed dealing with entrenched bureaucracy,\nSteven Levy: Besides the technical challenges, what are the biggest obstacles? Do you encounter foes dedicated to the status quo?\nHaley Van Dyck: The biggest foe is generally risk aversion. People in government are trained to not do things differently, because there‚Äôs often really bad consequences when you try something differently and it fails. We run up against this all the time.\nMikey Dickerson: I wish there were bad guys with top hats and handlebar mustaches, because if there was some supervillain behind a humongously dysfunctional project, all we would have to do is identify that person and take them out and everything would get better. That‚Äôs not the problem. The problem is just all of the things that inevitably happen when you try to coordinate 60,000 people in the VA to do the same thing at the same time. Even when somebody looks like they‚Äôre being a big pain, it‚Äôs just a function of their position in the bureaucracy and their role. Their interest is almost always wanting the same thing that we want, which is that they want the veterans to get a better experience, they want the disability claims to be adjudicated faster, but to them that doesn‚Äôt mean the same thing necessarily that it means to the person next to them.\nAsk Me One Thing\nB.J. asks, ‚ÄúHow much input, if any, did you have on the Hackers movie?‚Äù\nThanks for asking, B.J. I had zero input on that 1985 flick. If they had asked me for my input, here‚Äôs what I would have said: ‚ÄúPlease do not steal my book title for your unexceptional movie.‚Äù\nSeriously, Hackers the movie had nothing to do with Hackers the book, and the former offered no ideas about computers or hackers.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nAt the start of the year, hearing aid brand Zepp Clarity announced a new program to try to encourage more of the millions of people with hearing loss to give hearing aids‚Äîand particularly Zepp Clarity‚Äôs aids‚Äîa spin. The idea: try before you buy, with no strings attached.\nZepp Clarity hasn‚Äôt rolled out that business model yet, and a spokesperson says there‚Äôs still no ETA for the launch. Meanwhile, Zepp Clarity is still selling aids on a pay-up-front basis, with a 60-day money-back guarantee offer. (That‚Äôs in line with most other over-the-counter hearing aid sellers, which typically have generous returns policies.)\nThe hearing aid hardware isn‚Äôt changing after the try-on plan goes live, and Zepp Clarity will continue to sell the three hearing aid models I've reviewed below after it does. They are all markedly different. What they have in common is the basics: All have rechargeable batteries and a case that recharges via USB-C, and they come with various open and closed ear tips. All of them work with the Zepp Clarity app (Android, iOS)‚Äîpay attention, because there are a lot of apps called ‚ÄúZepp‚Äù out there‚Äîthough the interface is different for each device. None of the aids let you upload an audiogram, so you‚Äôll need to do all your tuning within the app. I tested all three‚Äîhere's what they're like.\nZepp Clarity Omni\nThese are the only behind-the-ear hearing aids in the Zepp Clarity collection, and they‚Äôre the cheapest of the trio. They‚Äôre also‚Äîby far‚Äîthe largest, weighing a massive 4.97 grams each, heavier even than the Elehear Beyond hearing aids and just shy of twice the weight of the Jabra Enhance Select 500. The large aids at least leave room for physical controls, with a volume up/down rocker on each (volume is controlled universally via either aid) and a multifunction button that can change the environmental mode or be used to stop/start streaming media.\nCompleting a basic hearing test in the app is highly encouraged during setup, after which each aid is programmed with one of three preset frequency-tuning configurations. These are somewhat blunt configurations that can‚Äôt be further refined beyond manually tweaking the bass/mid/treble levels. For users with relatively mild hearing loss, these types of programs‚Äîwhich are commonplace in lower-cost competitors‚Äîusually get the job done well enough.\nThe listening experience is hit-or-miss. After configuring the aids to my hearing needs, I found their overall audio quality to be on the thin and tinny side, dulling a lot of the lower frequencies and making for a slightly unnatural aural experience. There was quite a bit of feedback while putting them on, but this settled down quickly after getting them situated in my ears. On the plus side, I found the aids to be nearly hiss-free, which goes a long way toward smoothing out any complaints about the way the aids sound.\nThe experience was roughly the same while using the aids to stream media: There‚Äôs no real bass response, so music and dialog both sound a little unnatural, with none of the depth needed to make for an enriching listening session. The aids do however include Auracast, should you find yourself in the presence of a compatible streaming source.\nWhile the units carry a respectable 18-hour battery life‚Äîwith another 65 hours of charge available through the compact yet quite tall case‚Äîthey have one fatal flaw, and that‚Äôs their gigantic size. I‚Äôve never tested a pair of behind-the-ear hearing aids that are this big and bulky. They‚Äôre heavy and quickly become uncomfortable on their own. When paired with eyeglasses, they were almost nonfunctional, unable to coexist behind my ears alongside my frames.\nThese aids were priced at $899 when I began my review but were promptly slashed to $399 by the time I filed it. That makes for an immensely more compelling purchasing calculus, though all the discounts in the world won‚Äôt get you around their distinct lack of comfort.\nRating: 6/10\nZepp Clarity One\nA much different concept than the Omni, the Zepp Clarity One is an in-the-ear hearing aid designed with invisibility in mind. With a weight of just 1.06 grams per aid, the One hearing aids stand as some of the lightest I‚Äôve ever tested, barely edged out by the 0.96-gram Ceretone Core One hearing aids.\nThey are, unfortunately, not a great experience. To start with, these aids do not work with or support Zepp‚Äôs hearing test, and configurability is extremely limited. The app allows you to create up to four listening programs, each configurable with four settings for bass and treble adjustment and three for volume. I suspect most users will end up using three of the programs to set the aids to each of the three available volume levels while leaving bass/treble the same across them all.\nTo switch among the programs, you have to tap your ear rather hard twice, and the program for each ear must be set separately. An audio prompt lets you know which program you‚Äôre on, but God help you if both ears are on Program 1 and you want to move to Program 4. In a public space, the sight of you repeatedly slapping yourself on either side of your head will undoubtedly draw stares.\nBizarrely, the Zepp app only interacts with the hearing aids while they are in the case. When out of the case, the app doesn‚Äôt do anything except instruct you to replace them so it can ‚Äúretrieve your hearing aid information.‚Äù If you want to try different bass/treble/volume settings, you‚Äôll have to keep swapping the aids between the case and your ears until you find settings you like.\nAnd good luck on that front: The Zepp Clarity One aids are so limited in capabilities that I never found any setting that did me much good, though the level 2 volume and low-level bass and treble boosts were at least tolerable. At the highest volume level, I found the hearing aids close to unusable, creating a low-level hum that began to grate on the nerves after just a few minutes, while blasting loud noises like footsteps and keyboard taps. During parts of my testing, seemingly at random, the aids exhibited a terrifying amount of high-pitched feedback whenever the slightest noise was registered, making them all but unusable.\nBattery life for the aids is specified at 17 hours of continuous use, and Zepp Clarity says the case adds up to two more weeks‚Äî336 hours‚Äîof additional capacity. Note that these aids cannot be used for streaming media or taking phone calls over a Bluetooth connection; they work with real-world listening only.\nLike the Omni, these aids saw their price slashed, from $1,199 to $699, while I was working on the review. They‚Äôre still dramatically overpriced for what they do.\nUpdate: After this review was published, Zepp Clarity sent a new set of One hearing aids and suggested I speak to the company‚Äôs in-house audiologist to remedy the issues I encountered with the device. I did have better luck with the replacement hardware (complete with new firmware), though all the audiologist was able to do over the phone was advise on settings that might be best for me, since these aids cannot be remotely configured by a professional. I ultimately was able to reduce the hiss to a more tolerable level, though I did still encounter moments of random feedback. My overall experience was markedly improved, but the quality of hearing support the aids provided was never the best, and the audiologist admitted that the specific preset frequency tunings available in the One (geared toward high-frequency boosting) were unlikely to be wholly effective at addressing my particular audiogram.\nRating: 5/10\nZepp Clarity Pixie\nThe Zepp Clarity Pixie hearing aids take a design cue from the One aids, with an in-the-ear design and a per-aid weight of just 1.17 grams. The similarities diverge from there, however, as the Pixie aids are more customizable, with features more in line with the Omni than the stripped-down One.\nThe Pixie aids support the Zepp hearing test. As I‚Äôd already taken it for the Omni, I was able to copy those settings over to the Pixie aids without having to take the test again (though I later did a retest anyway). There are eight environmental program options available to the Pixie.\nZepp‚Äôs app for the Pixie is different from both the Omni and the One, offering a volume slider on one tab and eight preset environmental programs on another. These range from general to TV to restaurant to crowd.\nI‚Äôd like to say that there‚Äôs a significant difference among these listening modes, but the best that I can suggest is that the main difference involves the amount of hiss and high-pitched feedback they suffer from. Much like the Zepp Clarity One aids, the Pixie aids feature frequent and random bouts of ear-piercing squeals that are impossible to ignore, even at the bare minimum volume. A layer of static underlies this, ranging from minimal to grating, which makes the listening experience even more unbearable. The amplification and clarity improvements otherwise aren‚Äôt bad, and in the absence of all that feedback they might make for a compelling product. Alas, I was never able to dial the noise down to an acceptable level.\nThe aids have no physical controls and rely on the same tap-your-ear method as described above to switch among up to three different environmental modes you select in the app (though one is always set as the default mode). The aids can‚Äôt be used for streaming via Bluetooth, though they do feature a phone setting that is supposed to make it easier to hear phone calls played over your handset‚Äôs speaker without removing the aids from your ears. The feedback issues unfortunately didn‚Äôt make that possible for me.\nBattery life is specified at 17 hours per charge, with an extra 187 hours in the case. The case, incidentally, can be charged wirelessly in addition to the USB-C port.\nThe aids are comfortable enough physically, but so acoustically troubled as to make that largely irrelevant. As with the rest of Zepp‚Äôs aids, these were slashed in price from $1,999 to $999 while I was testing them. Compared to a similar product like the vastly superior Sony CRE-C20 aids at the same price, the calculus should be plainly obvious.\nRating: 4/10",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\">Battery life for the aids is specified at 17 hours of continuous use, and Zepp Clarity says the case adds up to two more weeks‚Äî336 hours‚Äîof additional capacity. Note that these aids cannot be used for streaming media or taking phone calls over a Bluetooth connection; they work with real-world listening only.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Like the Omni, these aids saw their price slashed, from $1,199 to $699, while I was working on the review. They‚Äôre still dramatically overpriced for what they do.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Update:</strong> After this review was published, Zepp Clarity sent a new set of One hearing aids and suggested I speak to the company‚Äôs in-house audiologist to remedy the issues I encountered with the device. I did have better luck with the replacement hardware (complete with new firmware), though all the audiologist was able to do over the phone was advise on settings that might be best for me, since these aids cannot be remotely configured by a professional. I ultimately was able to reduce the hiss to a more tolerable level, though I did still encounter moments of random feedback. My overall experience was markedly improved, but the quality of hearing support the aids provided was never the best, and the audiologist admitted that the specific preset frequency tunings available in the One (geared toward high-frequency boosting) were unlikely to be wholly effective at addressing my particular audiogram.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Rating: 5/10</strong></p><h2

the One aids, with an in-the-ear design and a per-aid weight of just 1.17 grams. The similarities diverge from there, however, as the Pixie aids are more customizable, with features more in line with the Omni than the stripped-down One.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The Pixie aids support the Zepp hearing test. As I‚Äôd already taken it for the Omni, I was able to copy those settings over to the Pixie aids without having to take the test again (though I later did a retest anyway). There are eight environmental program options available to the Pixie.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Zepp‚Äôs app for the Pixie is different from both the Omni and the One, offering a volume slider on one tab and eight preset environmental programs on another. These range from general to TV to restaurant to crowd.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I‚Äôd like to say that there‚Äôs a significant difference among these listening modes, but the best that I can suggest is that the main difference involves the amount of hiss and high-pitched feedback they suffer from. Much like the Zepp Clarity One aids, the Pixie aids feature frequent and random bouts of ear-piercing squeals that are impossible to ignore, even at the bare minimum volume. A layer of static underlies this, ranging from minimal to grating, which makes the listening experience even more unbearable. The amplification and clarity improvements otherwise aren‚Äôt bad, and in the absence of all that feedback they might make for a compelling product. Alas, I was never able to dial the noise down to an acceptable level.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The aids have no physical controls and rely on the same tap-your-ear method as described above to switch among up to three different environmental modes you select in the app (though one is always set as the default mode). The aids can‚Äôt be used for streaming via Bluetooth, though they do feature a phone setting that is supposed to make it easier to hear phone calls played over your handset‚Äôs speaker without removing the aids from your ears. The feedback issues unfortunately didn‚Äôt make that possible for me.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Battery life is specified at 17 hours per charge, with an extra 187 hours in the case. The case, incidentally, can be charged wirelessly in addition to the USB-C port.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The aids are comfortable enough physically, but so acoustically troubled as to make that largely irrelevant. As with the rest of Zepp‚Äôs aids, these were slashed in price from $1,999 to $999 while I was testing them. Compared to a similar product like the vastly superior <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/sony-cre-c20-hearing-aids/\">Sony CRE-C20</a> aids at the same price, the calculus should be plainly obvious.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Rating: 4/10</strong></p></div></div></body></html>",

Densely packed and tightly edited, the show covers topics like Xbox hacking, a Greek wiretapping Vodafone scandal, and the impact of the NotPetya malware. Rhysider skillfully weaves informative narratives to unravel complex issues and keeps things mostly accessible, though it may occasionally get a little too technical for some folks.\nSneak a peek behind the curtain, as this podcast follows the trials and tribulations of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, the tech startup that promised to disrupt blood testing but disintegrated in the face of whistleblowers, inaccurate results, and fraudulent claims. John Carreyrou‚Äôs reporting broke the scandal, and his book Bad Blood also spawned another interesting podcast. But The Dropout is a refreshingly clear recounting of the sordid tale, with season two tackling the trial.\nEx-Googler Tristan Harris, whom you may recognize from the Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, talks with Aza Raskin about the dangers of living your life online. As cofounders of the Center for Humane Technology, they delve into the ethics of Big Tech, unpack the potential pitfalls, and try to imagine ways to harness technology for the good of humanity.\nPainstakingly researched, this podcast dives deep into the world of sound to explain everything from those sounds you always hear in movie trailers to car engines, choral music, the Netflix intro, and way beyond. Learn how iconic sounds were created, why certain sounds make us feel the way they do, and how sound enriches our lives in myriad ways.\n- WIRED‚Äôs Uncanny Valley: If we may be so bold, our flagship podcast covers the latest weird and wonderful tech trends and explores Silicon Valley‚Äôs ascendancy. Ably hosted by Michael Calore, Zo√´ Schiffer, and Lauren Goode.\n- The Lazarus Heist: This captivating investigation starts with the Sony hacks, digs into the involvement of North Korean hackers, and moves on to a billion-dollar cybertheft.\n- Rabbit Hole: What is the internet doing to us? New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose investigates things like the impact of algorithms on radicalization with a dreamy soundscape backdrop.\n- Reply All: The beautifully paced, always convivial, and sorely missed Reply All dragged us down internet rabbit holes to investigate long-forgotten songs, phone scammers, hacked Snapchat accounts, and Team Fortress 2 bots.\n- Click Here: With a focus on cybersecurity, this podcast unravels tales of hacking, misinformation, cyberterrorism, and more, with interviews and insight from experts in episodes that usually come in under half an hour.\n- Waveform: Laid-back chats about the latest gadgets and developments in the world of tech with tech YouTuber Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) and cohost David Imel.\nBest Society Podcasts\nIf you want to understand the culture wars blighting our society, this well-researched podcast charts the slide into extremism. Through interviews with pro-lifers and anti-vaxxers, Ronson skillfully tackles unpalatable topics and roots out their inception, which is often based on misunderstanding. Jon Ronson is my favorite podcaster, as he brings an inquisitive, empathetic, and slightly neurotic intelligence to bear on fascinating and often surprising tales. We also recommend The Butterfly Effect (only on Audible) and The Last Days of August, which delve into the pornography industry, and So You‚Äôve Been Publicly Shamed, about folks being canceled on the internet.\nFamous German duo Siegfried and Roy were a mainstay on the Las Vegas show scene and performed about 30,000 times over five decades with an act that included white lions and tigers. When Roy was attacked live on stage, it made headlines everywhere. This podcast unravels their rise to stardom, touches on their controversial handling of wild animals, and digs into what happened that fateful night.\nIn this eclectic mix of quirky stories, Malcolm Gladwell tackles misunderstood events and rarely discussed ideas, veering from subjects like Toyota‚Äôs car recall to underhand-throwing basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain, and even the firebombing of Tokyo at the end of World War II. Gladwell freely mixes research and opinion and enjoys challenging conventional views, but every episode serves up facts and stories you have likely never heard before.\n- Mother, Neighbor, Russian Spy: You will be shocked by this true story about All-American Cindy Murphy with her two daughters, a house in the burbs, and a finance job in Manhattan, who turns out to be a deep cover Russian spy. There‚Äôs narration by Rosamund Pike and interviews with Cindy‚Äôs best friend and employer.\n- Dreamtown: The Story of Adelanto: This story of a small California town that turns to cannabis cultivation to try and revive itself soon descends into chaos.\n- Run Bambi Run: The riveting story of former Milwaukee police officer and Playboy Club bunny Laurie Bembenek, who was convicted of murdering her husband‚Äôs ex, despite conflicting evidence, and subsequently escaped prison and fought to have her conviction overturned.\n- Missing Richard Simmons: Ebullient fitness guru Richard Simmons used to be everywhere, and this podcast charts an investigative reporter‚Äôs attempts to find out why he disappeared.\n- The Moth: This podcast offers random folks the chance to tell deeply personal stories to a crowd of strangers and reinforces just how weird and wonderful humans are.\n- The Trojan Horse Affair: This tale unpacks the British scandal over an alleged attempt by Islamist extremists to take over a Birmingham school and radicalize its students.\n- Day X: A sobering look at the neo-Nazi specter in modern-day Germany, its possible infiltration of police and government, and a plan involving a military officer and a faked refugee identity.\n- Project Unabom: Delving into the life of Ted Kaczynski, this podcast interviews his brother and recounts the FBI investigation to try to make sense of Kaczynski‚Äôs terrifying bombing spree.\n- Will Be Wild: Curious about the January 6 insurrection? This podcast interviews people from both sides, examines the struggles of law enforcement and intelligence under Trump, and charts the anti-government extremism that led to this dark day for democracy.\nBest Culture Podcasts\nThe online shoe store Zappos made Tony Hsieh a billionaire, and this podcast investigates his $350 million investment in the Downtown Project in Las Vegas. His utopian vision of a happy worker village promised to revitalize the depressed heart of Sin City. The experimental community generated much excitement, but the charismatic and eccentric Hsieh soon ran into trouble.\nPart of the way into this investigation of the Rain City Superhero Movement, a real-life group of self-proclaimed superheroes active in Seattle a few years ago, I had to stop listening and check that this wasn‚Äôt fiction. The podcast focuses on the arrogant Phoenix Jones, an ex-MMA fighter turned violent vigilante, and his fall from grace. But there is also a fascinating glimpse into the friendlier side of the movement, with some heroes handing out water to homeless folks and helping people in distress.\nBrutally honest comedians with chemistry, Kid Fury and Crissle West recap and review the latest pop culture news and offer their opinions on everything. Insightful, funny, challenging, and refreshingly different from the podcast pack, these sprawling conversations run for a couple of hours, covering recent events and frequently touching on social justice, mental health, race, and sexual identity.\nLike eavesdropping on conversations between relatable besties, Forever35 started as a physical self-care podcast but expanded to discuss mental health, relationships, and any other topic that appeals to LA-based writers Doree Shafrir and Kate Spencer. They go from chatting about serums and creams to seasonal affective disorder and how to deal with a new stepmother as an adult‚Äîbut always in a fun, inclusive, and down-to-earth way.\n- The Big Flop: Where did all go wrong? From Watergate to Tom Cruise, this podcast pokes fun at pop culture fails. Host Misha Brown unpacks each disaster with the help of different guests and keeps things breezy and silly.\n- KILLED: Many magazine or newspaper stories are spiked every day, filed away, never to be seen again. This podcast delves into often shocking or disturbing stories silenced because they were considered dangerous, with interviews from the journalists who wrote them.\n- Sounds Like a Cult: Fanatical fringe groups have never been so prevalent, and there‚Äôs something more than a little cultish about celebrity stans, multilevel marketing, and marathon runners‚Äîjust three of the subjects this lighthearted podcast unpacks.\n- Armchair Expert With Dax Shepard: Now a Spotify exclusive, this often funny and always insightful podcast seeks out human truths and sometimes finds them.\n- Geek‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy: Ably hosted by author David Barr Kirtley, this sci-fi fantasy extravaganza digs into fascinating topics with the help of accomplished guests like Brent Spiner and Steven Pinker.\n- The Allusionist: If you are interested in words, this witty but accessible show will delight you as it charts the evolution of slang, explains euphemisms, and generally celebrates language.\nBest True-Crime Podcasts\nThis fascinating tale, told through interviews with old gangsters, law enforcement, politicians, and journalists, charts the symbiotic rise of organized crime and Las Vegas. The first season recounts the FBI‚Äôs attempts to take down the \"Hole in the Wall Gang\" and reveals the true-life inspiration for movies like Casino. Season two tackles Jimmy Hoffa and the battle to oust the mafia from the Strip‚Äôs casinos.\nSoothing host Phoebe Judge unravels captivating tales with reverence in this polished production about the spectrum of crime. Criminals, victims, lawyers, police, historians, and others whose lives have been altered by crime voice their stories as Judge carefully avoids the sensational and exploitative by respectfully teasing out the heart of each subject. A Criminal Plus subscription ($6 a month or $60 a year) gets you ad-free listening, bonus episodes, access to virtual events, and 20 percent off merch.\nGive this compelling mystery five minutes and you‚Äôll be hooked. The talented host, Brian Reed, investigates a small town in Alabama at the behest of eccentric horologist John B. McLemore, who claims the son of a wealthy family has gotten away with murder. The script, pacing, editing, music‚Äîbasically everything about this production‚Äîare perfect.\nPainstakingly researched, thoughtfully told, and skillfully produced, this true-crime podcast hosted by Gilbert King focuses on a 1987 Florida murder.

    "content_text": "There‚Äôs a new Captain America movie out this Valentine‚Äôs Day. This probably isn‚Äôt news to anyone‚Äîafter all, the new trailer for Captain America: Brave New World, in which Anthony Mackie‚Äôs Sam Wilson officially steps into the Cap role, aired during the Super Bowl. And millions will head to theaters this weekend to see the film, whose cast also includes Harrison Ford as Red Hulk (imagine the regular green one, but red).\nA decade ago, ‚Äúa new Captain America movie on Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Äù would have held a different cultural weight. At the time, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was arguably at its pop-cultural apex. And in a rare alignment between the fan-fiction world and the mass media one, Captain America was at the root of one of fandom‚Äôs ‚Äújuggernaut ships‚Äù: Stucky.\nUsing a portmanteau of Steve (Rogers, the old Cap) and Bucky (Barnes, his childhood best friend turned brainwashed super-assassin), the Stucky fandom‚Äôs romantic fics took off in the wake of 2014‚Äôs Captain America: The Winter Soldier. In the years that followed, they produced some of the most influential fan works ever created, and their stories remain popular.\nWhen Captain America: Civil War hit theaters in 2016, it made nearly $180 million domestically; Brave New World is on track to make a little more than $90 million this weekend. Critical reception of the film, as of this writing, has been lackluster. The contrast between the frenzy of the first Captain America trilogy and the far more muted reception of its new iteration offers a complicated snapshot of the current moment in fandom and pop culture.\nBroadly, it signals bigger trends: audiences weary of both superheroes and never-ending franchises, increasingly dispersed communities of fan creators, and the arguable end of ‚Äújuggernaut ships.‚Äù More specifically, Brave New World enters the zeitgeist with a Black superhero long cast aside in favor of white characters by both fans and the franchise itself, while also facing a boycott from some fans due to the inclusion of an Israeli character who was originally a Mossad agent in the comics.\nIf there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs true about the MCU in 2025, it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs a lot of it. Brave New World is the 35th big-screen installment to be released in a mere 17 years‚Äîand that‚Äôs not including all the television shows. Introduced in the comics in 1969, Sam Wilson made his onscreen debut in Winter Soldier as Steve Rogers‚Äô modern-day best friend. After supporting roles in subsequent films, his first star turn was as the titular Falcon in the 2021 Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier; now, he headlines the first Captain America movie in nine years.\nAs the titles in the MCU and other big franchises have piled up, the quality of the films has fallen off‚Äîand audience enthusiasm has fallen off with it. In the 2020s, franchises have been contending with increasingly fractured media consumption patterns caused by everything from Covid-19 to TikTok to political chaos. Still, studios seem to churn out constant ‚Äúcontent‚Äù‚Äîmovies and shows mired in a vast array of characters presented in connected, multiverse-heavy storylines. Viewers, forced into an all-or-nothing situation, have to follow along with every single installment or feel lost. Last year, Disney CEO Bob Iger vowed to slow the company‚Äôs output of Marvel films, but it seemed as though burnout had already set in.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to hold eight films in your head at once with 50 interlocking characters,‚Äù says JSA Lowe, an adjunct professor of film and literature at the University of Houston‚ÄìClear Lake. She offers the linguistic term ‚Äúsemantic depletion‚Äù for thinking about the MCU and other big franchises that have pushed out nonstop installments in recent years. ‚ÄúWith each iteration, something can get more watered down,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou can retcon your retcons, but at a certain point, you lose the audience‚Äôs engagement‚Äîyou lose their willingness to keep entertaining these iterations.‚Äù\nAt the height of the franchise, Lowe was a Captain America fan (and especially a Sam Wilson fan). She cites Winter Soldier as one of the few MCU titles that stands alone well enough to teach in the classroom now‚Äîand that she thinks will be teachable in a decade, too. (Another is 2018‚Äôs Black Panther, which she taught in a mythology class last semester.)\nThat self-contained-ness‚Äîand the bigger world the film gestures to but doesn‚Äôt fully spell out‚Äîwas also a key reason why Winter Soldier was such fertile ground for fans making transformative works a decade ago. ‚ÄúWe would pour over screen caps from the film,‚Äù says a writer with the pen name tigrrmilk who is behind a number of Stucky fics and collaborated on ‚ÄúSteve Rogers at 100: Celebrating Captain America on Film,‚Äù one of the most popular fan works of the era. ‚ÄúWe called it the Citizen Kane of Tumblr,‚Äù she jokes. ‚ÄúThere was always more to discover, and there was a lot of really nerdy, fandomy close reading.‚Äù\nSetting aside the perpetual exception that is Harry Potter, many big fic fandoms of earlier eras came out of cult-favorite shows like Stargate Atlantis or Due South. Captain America fandom‚Äôs contemporaries were more in tune with mainstream audiences‚ÄîSherlock, Teen Wolf, and Supernatural chief among them‚Äîbut none were at the scale of the MCU. Like other big fandoms of the era, its sheer size meant there were many corners to explore and various thematic niches. ‚ÄúThere was so much happening,‚Äù says tigrrmilk. ‚ÄúIt really was a behemoth, in a way that I‚Äôve really not experienced with other things.‚Äù\nEven with all those various niches, the dominant force in the fandom was Stucky. Consistently one of the most popular ships across fandoms in the 2010s, Stucky fans wrote epic fics that swept through the history of the 20th century and played with ideas of politics and identity. Around the release of 2016‚Äôs Captain America: Civil War, fans tweeted the hashtag #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend, pushing the idea of the ship beyond the pages of Archive of Our Own (AO3) and onto the radar of the broader pop-culture world. By the time Steve Rogers bowed out of the franchise in 2019‚Äôs Avengers: Endgame, many fans felt the relationship‚Äîeven the friendship‚Äîof Steve and Bucky had been deliberately downplayed in response to the ship. His trip back in time to live out the latter half of the 20th century with Peggy Carter left some fans feeling downright betrayed.\nRegardless of how the franchise handled the characters onscreen, the Stucky ship continued to flourish in fan works. Writers still pen stories about them to this day. Lowe was initially drawn into the world by the onscreen relationship between Steve and Sam, but she often found herself reading Stucky due to the large volume of high-quality work. (She had a particular weakness, she notes, for the fandom‚Äôs tendency to write Bucky Barnes as Jewish.)\nSam Wilson, she explains, was often sidelined in Captain America and Avengers fan works, regularly cast in the role of providing free therapy for traumatized white characters. The fandom‚Äôs treatment of Wilson and other Black characters has been long discussed by fans‚Äîand that‚Äôs a discussion that continues as Wilson takes on the Cap mantle in the films. Last month, AO3 announced it would be splitting the Captain America tag into ‚ÄúChris Evans‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnthony Mackie‚Äù versions (with the more than 100,000 existing Captain America works sorted by default into the former category). The decision immediately sparked condemnation‚Äîquestions of ‚Äúwho asked for this?‚Äù and commentary of ‚Äúseparate but equal.‚Äù\nThat fandom sidelining is an echo of the franchise's treatment of the character, too. Kelsey White, a longtime Sam Wilson fan‚Äîor as she puts it, ‚Äúfanatic‚Äù‚Äîsays Mackie‚Äôs introduction into the cinematic universe got her back into comics. ‚ÄúI was living for the Black representation and couldn‚Äôt wait to see Winter Soldier,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSaying I was in love is an understatement. They made a Black man be emotionally intelligent and made that how he bonded with Steve.‚Äù\nBut she notes that even as Sam ostensibly had a more central role in the franchise in recent years, it was hard to see evidence of that onscreen‚Äîor in the franchise‚Äôs promotion and marketing. ‚ÄúAs a POC, you tend to hope and pray that you can get merch of the characters that look like you,‚Äù White says, but she has found little for Wilson or Brave New World from the usual distributors. ‚ÄúCome on. It‚Äôs Black History Month and you can‚Äôt get your teams together to celebrate Sam Cap?‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs been widely observed that for Marvel, franchise fatigue‚Äîand the flagging quality of the studio‚Äôs projects‚Äîset in just as they finally diversified their leading roster after hanging up the jerseys of its beloved white male heroes in Endgame. ‚ÄúFor Anthony Mackie, that's unfortunate,‚Äù says Lowe. ‚ÄúThe time is just not right‚Äîand that‚Äôs not on him. That‚Äôs not even on the production. It‚Äôs just that history has marched on.‚Äù\nBrave New World in particular is also facing a boycott from fans. First called for by the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divest, and Sanction movement, which leads a range of economic-focused actions against Israel, the boycott is a response to the film‚Äôs inclusion of the Israeli comic character Sabra, an agent in Israel‚Äôs intelligence organization Mossad. While the character‚Äôs name and backstory have been changed for the film, the movie‚Äôs Hollywood premiere on Tuesday was met with in-person protests. Many fans, it seems, are looking to sit this one‚Äîand even the broader franchise‚Äîout. These geopolitical discussions also connect to critiques of the MCU‚Äôs relationship with the US Department of Defense, long a point of discussion within the fandom but thrust into mainstream focus when 2018‚Äôs Captain Marvel was used for Air Force recruitment.\nBad critical reviews or ambivalence around the source material aren‚Äôt necessarily impediments to fan creators‚Äîjust look at the continued dominance of Harry Potter in the fan-fiction space. But the relatively muted cultural response to newer Marvel titles also reflects just how much fan culture has changed in the past decade. Transformative fandom is far, far larger than it was at the start of the MCU, but compared to the early Captain America era, fans are more disparate, spreading their interests across a much wider range of source material.\nMany fans also spend less time in one place, cycling through a fandom for a few months, even weeks, before moving on. The deep, sustained interest in a world that fueled so much Captain America fic in its heyday is harder to find now, especially at scale. With so much content across film and television, fans barely have time to latch on to anything‚Äîor to spin up their own versions of the characters and their worlds in the gaps.\nEarly box-office projections suggest Brave New World will do well for Marvel, potentially putting it on track with the opening performance of Winter Soldier. Like all entertainment corporations, money is the key metric for Marvel and its parent company, Disney. Whether they‚Äôre creating space for fan creativity doesn‚Äôt particularly matter if the numbers are still there. But for fans, the return of Captain America to the big screen is a moment to reflect on past eras and see just how much has changed. They‚Äôll have to do it quickly‚Äîthere are only 10 weeks until the next MCU title, Thunderbolts*, hits theaters in May.",

    "content_text": "Dating apps promised to make finding love easier. For many users, though, they‚Äôve just made it more exhausting. Swiping, ghosting, and endless conversations that rarely materialize into real-life dates have left people burned out and disillusioned. A cultural shift is underway as singles ditch the apps in favor of real-world connections.\nSan Francisco athletic communities like the volunteer-run tennis group The Mission Athletic Club (TMAC), the cycling collective Fatcake, and a private running club we visited with are proving that connections forged through sweaty hobbies lead to deeper, more lasting relationships. These groups, which have anywhere from a few dozen members to a thousand, aren‚Äôt just about romance‚Äîthey‚Äôre about community, consistency, and the kind of social bonds that form when people see each other week after week.\nFollowing the Covid-19 lockdowns, there‚Äôs been a renewed hunger for in-person connection, and for many, that means expanding social circles in spaces where dating isn‚Äôt the primary focus. Instead of assessing every new encounter for its dating potential, people are gravitating toward environments where relationships, romantic or otherwise, develop naturally over time.\nThere‚Äôs no better proof that the best way to meet someone might not be through a screen but through the shared experience of play, sweat, and adventure.\nLove Match\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm open to playing doubles for life,‚Äù says Belinda Huang, a single twentysomething who enjoys the natural way relationships develop on the tennis court. She‚Äôs a member of TMAC, a club that hosts tennis matches and off-court social activities. Seeing the same faces week after week allows friendships, and sometimes love, to evolve organically, she says, without the pressure of a first-date setting.\nTMAC‚Äôs founder, Prince Boucher, puts it best: ‚ÄúPlay is the way; love is the goal.‚Äù While TMAC wasn‚Äôt created as a dating hub, its emphasis on fun, inclusivity, and community has led to plenty of relationships. The club has about 1,000 rotating members.\nFor those who aren‚Äôt actively looking for romance, TMAC is still a social lifeline. One member, who only gave her first name, MJ, shared that she had never used dating apps and preferred meeting people through shared activities. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs refreshing to connect over something you both love rather than trying to force a spark through a screen.‚Äù\nSean Lee and Jina Zhu were already a couple when they joined TMAC, but they were inspired to have a tennis-themed proposal thanks to the group. The ring was hidden in a custom tennis-ball-shaped box.\nRiding Off Into the Sunset\nThe cycling collective Fatcake was created to provide a more inclusive space in the male-dominated cycling scene, with a focus on gender and queer inclusivity. Many members join to make friends, meet like-minded people, and enjoy a shared passion, though several members admit the possibility of meeting someone special is always in the back of their minds.\nTwo serious relationships have emerged out of Fatcake. Liz Schinski shared that after months of riding with the group without meeting anyone of interest, she kept attending simply for the community. Then, one day, her now-partner joined. She spent the next two months strategically showing up to flirt with him until they finally set up a date. They‚Äôve been happily together ever since.\nAnother couple met during a grueling 6:30 am ride, bonding over their shared love of cycling and skiing. Their connection built over time, without the pressure of swiping and forced small talk.\nOf course, dating within an athletic group comes with its own challenges. Serious cyclists can spend upwards of 15 hours a week on the bike, not including post-ride coffee stops and social hangouts. That level of commitment can put a strain on relationships if both partners are not equally invested.\nCamille Matonis, a single member of Fatcake, jokes that when she‚Äôs on dating apps, her motto is simple: ‚ÄúNo bike, no swipe.‚Äù Her friend Mandeep Gill laughs and adds, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a 10, but he doesn‚Äôt ride bikes.‚Äù\nFor these cyclists, meeting through Fatcake provides an immediate foundation of shared interests, something dating apps rarely offer. Instead of filtering potential matches through arbitrary profile traits, they bond over the thrill of a long ride, the camaraderie of early group meetups, and the spontaneous moments that unfold along the way.\nRunning Toward Connection or Something More\nRunning clubs have a reputation as hot spots for singles, but not all fit that mold. One high-energy private club in San Francisco prioritizes community first. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a run club, not a dating club,‚Äù says member Andrew McGrath. ‚ÄúBut when you‚Äôre doing something you love, sometimes you find people you love.‚Äù\nStill, dating within a running group has its challenges. Baharak Arjo noted that some men casually chat with multiple women and stop short of forming real connections. She also pointed out there are generational divides in club dating etiquette, and some members can feel caught between age groups.\nDespite these dynamics, this run group proves that clubs like theirs offer more than just a workout. Whether people come to train, to meet new friends, or to find something deeper, one thing is clear‚Äîconnections happen naturally when you‚Äôre moving in the same direction.",

    "content_text": "Love is simple, says Reverend Paul Anthony Daniels, because ‚Äúin its most visceral form,‚Äù it boils down to three things: spit, semen, and sweat. Ok, maybe four. Sometimes there is blood. ‚ÄúTo share love in that way is so visceral.‚Äù\nI have a confession, I tell Daniels. I have never been in love‚Äînot in the Hallmark movie kind of way, at least‚Äîbut find myself craving it the older I get, so I‚Äôm a little stunned to hear him describe it with such candor. You know, being a priest and all. God is in people, he says. Which means, God is also in sex.\nDaniels loves love. He seeks it in everything he does, he tells me, but especially in people. It‚Äôs part of his job as an Episcopal priest and a ‚Äúmediator of Christ‚Äôs love in the world.‚Äù Ceremonially, he is ‚Äúa steward of the sacraments‚Äîthe Eucharist, baptism, marriage, confirmation. I invite people into a relationship with God through those sacred ritual acts. But it‚Äôs also more than that.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs the more part that‚Äôs got me in Los Angeles‚Äô Koreatown sitting across from him in his apartment as he sips from a whiskey glass, going on about desire, salvation, and all the irresistible ways people come together. A graduate of Morehouse College and Yale Divinity School, Daniels, 34, is not your average Episcopal priest. He‚Äôs something of a trailblazer. A rogue in a clerical collar.\nAlthough faith has been central to Daniels‚Äô identity since his boyhood in Raleigh, North Carolina, he also grew up with an abiding appreciation for music‚ÄîStevie Wonder, Chaka Khan, John Mayer. In 2007, he auditioned for season 7 of American Idol and made it all the way to Hollywood Week. ‚ÄúAs soon as I walked to the hotel in Pasadena I knew that I was not slated to be one of the young people that they were going to pay attention to,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAll the producers had their eyes on David Archuleta.‚Äù\nHe returned to Raleigh and dug deeper into what eventually became his calling. Being openly gay and Christian meant he had the capacity to ‚Äúsay and do things that could open doors of possibility for people.‚Äù Daniels has since made that into his life‚Äôs work. Hence the whole spit, semen, sweat thing. There‚Äôs a bigger context to all of this, he wants me to know. It also helps that he often gives lectures on these very topics‚Äî‚Äúsexual socialities as theological questions‚Äù‚Äîin addition to being a PhD candidate at Fordham University.\nMost people today have what Daniels calls a ‚Äúconsumerist devotion built around the consumption of material things‚Äîbodies, clothes, objects.‚Äù The worst instances of that are on social media. He encounters it on Instagram (his favorite dating platform) and the various hookup apps he frequents. Social media, he says, has become a ‚Äúsite of worship‚Äîpun intended.‚Äù\nJason Parham: As a priest who uses dating and hookup apps, how do you navigate your relationship to desire?\nPaul Anthony Daniels: One of my life mottos is ‚ÄúFollow desire.‚Äù\nWhere did that come from?\nMichel de Certeau, a French Jesuit and literary theorist, said the mystic is always on the move because God cannot be circumscribed to any one place or any one thing. My relationship to the holy has been in the spirit of that kind of mystical movement. There‚Äôs a queerness in the unsettledness. I‚Äôve grown closer to God by growing closer to a deeper sense of who I am and who God made me to be, so there's that. But also I love sex. There‚Äôs nothing like meeting another body to which you can surrender. Where all of yourself, all of your guards, all of your insecurities, all of your fear evaporates in the image of love.\nAlmost like God.\nYes, almost like God. A person becomes the image‚Äîand idol‚Äîof love. To share love in that way is so visceral. Literally, it is spit. It is semen. It is sweat. Sometimes it is blood.\nAll of that.\nAnd to have all of that in the context of tenderness, of course shame would be evacuated. That‚Äôs precisely the image of Jesus on the cross. It is visceral and it is gross and it is suffering, but that is also the image of our salvation. That sacrifice happens for our capacity to see ourselves as no longer subject to the state, no longer subject to powers that would attempt to shame and silence us. Jesus gives his life that we might see ourselves more clearly and more bravely. That‚Äôs also what happens in the context of a sexual relationship. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm always going to follow desire, because in it is liberation. One of the greatest sins is that people have had their capacity to be brave in their desires stolen. The sin is not sex.\nWhat apps have helped facilitate your pursuit of desire?\nInstagram, Hinge, Tinder. I‚Äôm also a newly minted Jack‚Äôd user. My only relationship in LA began on Hinge. Instagram is basically a dating app for me. My profile is curated mostly for the sake of flirting.\nReally?\nThere is nothing on my grid that is in line with my calling, in terms of being inspirational and accompanying people into a new understanding of God. I save most of that for my Story. That said, I am constantly aware of the ways in which my presence on social media, and my interactions with people on social media, may fall short of the deeper meaning that my calling impresses upon me. But I also have a responsibility to talk about and share with others how I‚Äôm seeing and living in the world.\nSo you feel obligated to post?\nI do. I feel obligated to post about how I interpret the world. I hate that, but I also love it. I hate it because I don‚Äôt want to participate in a consumerist exercise where it‚Äôs all about affect and, you know, pithy sayings and being sentimental.\nYes.\nAt the same time, my calling is to people who have been exiled and ostracized by the church. So if I‚Äôm not in some way fully embodied as a witness in spaces where people live and exist and talk‚Äîif I‚Äôm not present in the spaces where people are‚Äîthen I‚Äôm not living up to the call that I have, which is to give people permission to be freer and to be liberated.\nWhat‚Äôs an example of that?\nThere was one Tinder date during my time in New York City that completely changed my life. It changed my perception of who I was in relation to other people as a gay Black man who is also a priest.\nIn what way?\nI was working at a cathedral and lived on the campus of the cathedral. This person was a former service member‚Äîa gay Black guy from the South. When he came over to my apartment, he sat down and said, ‚ÄúI feel redeemed.‚Äù I was like, Ugh.\nWhy that reaction?\nPersonally I have no desire to be the savior for my partner. That‚Äôs not interesting to me at all. But he followed up very quickly. He said, ‚ÄúI feel redeemed not by you but by being in this space. Being intimate in this space is my way of saying I can be who I am in the face of this thing that was detrimental to my development.‚Äù\nHe felt stunted by the institution of the church.\nIt made me realize there may be a lot more going on in how I share intimacy with other people, and I need to be able to make space for that.\nWas the sex good?\n[Pauses.] That‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt work. I would never say it was bad sex, the chemistry just wasn‚Äôt intuitive.\nIs that a typical experience?\nNo, but dating apps have brought to the surface a very difficult relationship I have to my body.\nHow so?\nI‚Äôve developed a deeply self-conscious relationship to my body. Sometimes when things don‚Äôt move forward with certain guys, I know it‚Äôs because I don't meet a particular standard of excellence in terms of what my body looks like. I had a guy say to me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna need you to have more muscle mass.‚Äù This was someone that I adored, and still adore.\nThat‚Äôs tough.\nI can‚Äôt help to think that a major part of the reason it fell apart was because of a particular kind of physical inadequacy. So dating apps have forced me to come to grips with what I think about my body, why I think about my body in that way, and how I think about other people's bodies.\nThere does seem to be a very unhealthy culture around body standards on gay hookup apps especially.\nI was on Jack‚Äôd the other day looking. I opened my messages, and every avatar had their shirt off. Every single one. I remember thinking, I didn‚Äôt choose all of those people; they came to my profile. Which is also crazy, because I don‚Äôt have an image up, it‚Äôs blank.\nWhy blank?\nI enjoy the mystery. But my profile is also that way, because on Jack‚Äôd I don‚Äôt feel like I have anything to offer by way of visuality. It is all about a broad shoulder, washboard abs, a full chest. I like to be able to choose. It‚Äôs an internalized sense of inadequacy that determines how I basically don‚Äôt present myself on Jack‚Äôd.\nWhere do you think that‚Äîlet‚Äôs call it‚Äî‚Äúaesthetic overload‚Äù comes from?\nOne of the gifts of being gay is the nonreproductive part. As a gay person, you get to be visceral and primal and utterly exposed to another person without the fear of pregnancy. It‚Äôs just a straight-up viscerality that‚Äôs available to us, to lesbians, and to all kinds of queer people. Again, we live in a society that is primarily consumerist. The subconscious way that people operate or function is through the idea of consumption. Get as much as you can as often as you can. It‚Äôs as if we‚Äôre wrought in a non-ethic of accumulation.\nHow does that relate to queerness?\nI‚Äôm all for the reconfiguration of relationships and thinking about different ways in which people can be in relationships beyond monogamy. I‚Äôm totally here for that. Even if we have a politics that attempts to resist some of the capitalist tendencies that exist inside of monogamy and the traditional monogamous relationship by being differently formed, we can‚Äôt completely rid ourselves of that sensibility. It‚Äôs consumerist. It‚Äôs a desire for accumulation.\nI would also call that being human.\nThe other part of it is, most of us don‚Äôt live in the kinds of isolated communities that we grew up in. There isn‚Äôt accountability to community in the same way. It‚Äôs almost like we lack a particular kind of groundedness that would inspire or bolster more genuine connection.\nThe sexual social revolution has changed how we define intimacy and fantasy online, whether that‚Äôs through OnlyFans, Sniffies, or subcommunities like Freak Twitter. What have we lost, and what have we gained as a result of that?\nI don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôve lost, because humanity‚Äôs always been debased. I came across a quote from Sigmund Freud today that said, ‚ÄúI have found little that is ‚Äògood‚Äô about human beings on the whole. In my experience most of them are trash.‚Äù Your question implies that there was something to lose. It implies that there was something pure and pristine that we lost, and I don‚Äôt think there was ever a period like that. Part of what we‚Äôve gained, however, is an entry into kinds of fantasy that people may not have had as easy access to before, and that can be really powerful. Religion is nothing if not fantasy.\nIn what way?\nSpeaking from within the confines of my tradition, God comes into the world in the person of Jesus Christ. They execute a brilliant healing ministry. It inspires tons of people but threatens the state. So the state kills him. Then God is like, Ha! You thought you had me, I‚Äôm back.\nJust like that Miley Cyrus meme.\nIt‚Äôs very much giving ‚ÄúThey tried to kill your favorite bitch.‚Äù Jesus comes back and people are like, What the fuck?! To believe in Jesus is to believe in the spectacular and the miraculous. There is a certain impossibility and also a certain absence implied in Christian belief. That is fantasy.\nTrue.\nA religious discipline teaches you there‚Äôs always more than what you‚Äôre seeing. That‚Äôs not to say that these platforms, which provide access to various forms of fantasy, are not also caught in the consumerist culture. They are in no way innocent. They are in no way invulnerable to violence, to abuse, to perversion. Michel Foucault said, ‚ÄúNot everything is bad, but everything is dangerous.‚Äù There‚Äôs a sense in which these things that invite us into a more vast experience of reality and even perhaps ourselves are wrought with danger.\nCertain people, especially today, are quick to equate difference with danger, not realizing there can be beauty in difference. Right Reverend Mariann Budde recently went viral for asking President Donald Trump to show mercy to LGBTQ+ and migrant communities. Given this fractured political moment, do you feel a sense of duty to speak up?\nI do feel an obligation to resist in a public way, and developing a platform to do that at a very high level is something that I‚Äôm working on right now. It‚Äôs time for Christians of good conscience to enter the fight with an arsenal of criticality and beauty, and to present the gospel in a way that is honest to the gospel and not whitewashed by complete mania and absurdity. Mercy and love are fundamental Christian orthodoxy. But I am also not interested in constantly reacting to the gross stupidity of that person.\nSo that‚Äôs the work‚Äîmercy and love?\nThe priest is a mediator of Christ in the world and to be an example of God‚Äôs love. I don‚Äôt get to turn that off in romantic relationships. There‚Äôs a certain degree to which I approach everything in life as like, ‚ÄúIt is my duty to love this‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt is my duty to pursue love and to do it bravely.‚Äù So I date a lot. And it doesn‚Äôt work out a lot. But in a way that builds up the callus to continuously pursue love with grace. It is my love of God that informs my love of love in general.\nWhat do you say to people who say your idea of love is wrong?\nI don‚Äôt give a fuck.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nElon Musk‚Äôs toxicity among many Europeans is such that even owners of Tesla news websites have ditched Muskmobiles for other EV brands. Jon Gibbs of Birmingham, England, runs what he calls the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs biggest Tesla inventory site.\" Tesla-info, Gibbs says, stores the ‚Äúlargest database of new and used Tesla motors in the world.‚Äù He used to own one himself‚Äîbut he now drives a BMW iX electric SUV.\nLikewise, Tim Kraaijvanger of the Netherlands, founder of Tesla360.nl, a Dutch everything-Tesla site, recently sold his Model Y and bought a Polestar instead. Both entrepreneurs pin their car switch on Musk‚Äôs support for European far-right political parties and his inauguration rally arm gestures.\n‚ÄúWhile Musk might get away with a [Nazi-like] salute in some parts of the world, European markets reject such behavior,‚Äù Kraaijvanger tells WIRED. ‚ÄúWorld War II still casts a long shadow.\" He may be right. Tesla sales are in free fall in Europe right now. Last month, Norway‚Äîwhere EVs overtook internal combustion vehicles in total market share in 2024‚Äîrecorded a biting 37.9 percent slump. At the same time, Tesla sales in France fell by a thumping 63.4 percent. And it gets even worse: In Spain, Tesla sales plummeted by 75.4 percent.\nKraaijvanger, founder of online marketing firm Stormachtig, started Tesla360.nl in 2020, then rolled out a German version three years later. He has owned several Tesla cars and, later this year, planned to upgrade to the refreshed $59,990 Model Y Juniper. Offloading his current Model Y has cost him dearly: ‚ÄúI received only about half of the [Tesla‚Äôs] original new price when selling it,‚Äù he revealed. ‚ÄúBut I do not wish to be associated with [Musk‚Äôs] ideology.‚Äù\nHe has yet to ditch his URLs, but then running websites is mainly anonymous. On the other hand, driving a Tesla on public roads is becoming increasingly problematic in Europe. Social media is rife with images of Teslas vandalized with Swastikas and expletives. Dealerships are also being targeted. Vandals sprayed graffiti on a Tesla car showroom in The Hague in early February, defacing the building with ‚ÄúNo to Nazis‚Äù and sweary anti-fascist slogans.\nOn a grander scale, the English campaign group Led by Donkeys recently teamed up with Germany‚Äôs Center for Political Beauty to beam an image of Elon Musk making the inauguration salute onto Tesla‚Äôs gigafactory in Berlin, with the word ‚ÄúHeil‚Äù projected next to the lit Tesla logo. ‚ÄúThis is who Elon Musk really is,‚Äù stressed Led by Donkeys across their well-followed social media accounts. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt buy a Tesla‚Äù urged the activists.\nStartup crowdfunded group Everyone Hates Elon has been distributing anti-Tesla stickers in London with left-wing outlet Novara Media reporting that ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of Tesla owners have returned to their parked EVs to find them defaced with hard-to-remove roundels featuring a grinning Musk plastered with a Hitler-aping toothbrush mustache and the request not to ‚Äúbuy a Swastikar.‚Äù\nSome Tesla owners are themselves defacing their cars, with the ‚ÄúI Bought This Before We Knew Elon Was Crazy‚Äù bumper sticker being a particular favorite. ‚ÄúI have seen massive uplift in sales across Europe,‚Äù Matthew Hiller of Hawaii-based Mad Puffer Stickers tells WIRED. ‚ÄúLeading the way are buyers from France, Norway, and the UK,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúI used to want a Tesla until Elon turned into a full-on fascist,‚Äù claims Hiller on his otherwise fish-themed store. He figures there‚Äôs a ‚Äúlot of disgruntled Tesla owners out there‚Äù and claims to have sold thousands of sticker sets across the world.\n‚ÄúI went so far as to test drive a Tesla in 2023, but at that time, [Musk‚Äôs] purchase of Twitter was complete, and I saw what he was doing to the platform,‚Äù says Hiller. ‚ÄúSkewing the algorithm to favor alt-right voices, promoting disinformation, banning people he didn‚Äôt like. Using his influence to wade into politics really turned me off buying a Tesla‚Äîit‚Äôs a MAGA hat on wheels.‚Äù\nMusk‚Äôs ‚Äúsalute‚Äù has boosted Hiller‚Äôs sales. ‚ÄúIt has been a sustained 500 sales a day since the salute,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat moment broke through all the usual Elon noise. Even the [MAGA-lite folks] who only casually pay attention to what is happening in the government woke up at that moment and were like ‚ÄòHoly shit, what have we done?‚Äô‚Äù\nAnother of Hiller‚Äôs most popular stickers for Tesla owners states that the driver is now a member of the ‚ÄúAnti Elon Tesla Club.‚Äù She might not have yet bought such a sticker, but Tesla shareholder Karen R√≥bertsd√≥ttir of Reykjavik, Iceland, should perhaps become at least an associate member. ‚ÄúThe Tesla groups over here in Iceland used to never have the sort of ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt buy a Tesla because of Elon‚Äô stuff you‚Äôd see in the States‚Äîbut now it‚Äôs everywhere, and the people I talk to elsewhere in Europe are seeing the same thing,‚Äù she wrote over the weekend on Tesla‚Äôs YouTube channel.\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve defended you guys so much over the years, and you make great products, but even I can‚Äôt stick up for you anymore,‚Äù she stated.\nR√≥bertsd√≥ttir, now a software developer for Icelandic air traffic control company Isavia, started her tech career as founder of Iowa-based Celadon Applications. This 2009 startup developed software for electric vehicles. A long-time Tesla stockholder, one of her resolutions was put to the vote at Tesla‚Äôs annual shareholder meeting in 2023, calling on Tesla‚Äôs board to release a succession plan for Musk and other ‚Äúkey persons‚Äù whose behavior could create a risk for the company and shareholders.\n‚ÄúWhen people look at this company,‚Äù she said at the meeting, ‚Äúthey see the company as a synonym for its CEO.‚Äù (The board recommended rejecting the resolution, and it was duly voted down.)\nWhile some shareholders have already voted with their feet‚Äîin January, Dutch civil service pension fund ABP sold its ‚Ç¨782 million stake in Tesla, for instance‚Äîmost still seem unbothered by Musk‚Äôs trolling, or his apparent takeover of the US government's executive branch with the help of young coders. Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúpedo guy‚Äù comments against a British cave rescue diver, successfully defended in a 2019 defamation trial, didn‚Äôt ruffle that many shareholder feathers, but it‚Äôs harder to ignore sales cull calls.\nIn late January, Poland‚Äôs sports and tourism minister S≈Çawomir Nitras lobbied for a Tesla boycott. ‚ÄúThere is no justification for any reasonable Pole to continue purchasing Teslas,‚Äù he said.\nIn Germany, where Musk has caused outrage by endorsing far-right political party Alternative for Germany (AfD), going so far as to appear as a surprise video guest at the party's national election campaign launch last month, several companies have cut ties with Tesla. Drugstore chain Rossmann, with 4,700 stores across Europe, has replaced Tesla in its electric fleet with other EV brands, citing the ‚Äúincompatibility‚Äù of its corporate values and Musk‚Äôs ideology.\nGerman energy company LichtBlick revealed an uncoupling from Tesla on a LinkedIn post. ‚ÄúWe are pulling the plug on Tesla vehicles in our fleet,‚Äù said the announcement, with the firm‚Äôs real estate head, Kevin L√ºtje, clarifying that ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äôs support of Donald Trump and his recommendation to vote for a right-wing populist and right-wing extremist party ‚Ä¶ is in no way compatible with LichtBlick‚Äôs values.‚Äù He stated that ‚Äúclimate protection and electromobility are extremely important to us, but in the future we will be relying on providers other than Tesla.‚Äù\nSuch boycotts benefit Tesla‚Äôs rivals. ‚ÄúWe have seen an increase in people writing to us and switching to Polestar in recent months,‚Äù Polestar‚Äôs German CEO Michael Lohscheller tells WIRED. Lohscheller called Musk‚Äôs endorsement of AfD ‚Äútotally unacceptable.‚Äù\nThere are many reasons for Tesla‚Äôs waning fortunes in Europe‚Äîincluding stale model line-up (Geely‚Äôs Gothenburg-developed Zeekr 7X SUV has more bells and whistles than a Model Y) and expense (a Model 3 costs ‚Ç¨39,990 in Europe, while many better EVs are biting into this price point)‚Äîbut Musk‚Äôs steady descent from real-life Tony Stark to MAGA power broker seems to be a key reason for Tesla‚Äôs current precipitous fall from grace.\nTesla sales dropped 13 percent across the whole European Union in 2024, according to data from the industry body ACEA, and just like in Spain and France, in many key markets the fall is still steeper. According to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, Tesla registered only 1,277 new cars in Germany in January, a year-on-year drop of 59.5 percent.\nTesla was contacted for this piece and did not respond, but there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel for Tesla sales in Europe. A recent survey by Dutch news outlet EenVandaag got responses from 432 Tesla drivers. Some ‚Äú31 percent are either contemplating selling their car or have already done so,‚Äù the survey found. Forty percent of owners felt embarrassed to own a Tesla. By any measure, these are statistics that no car company wants to own.",

    "content_text": "Last week, the US federal government froze a national program intended to send $5 billion in funding to efforts at building charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, with the goal being the construction of half a million new EV chargers in the United States by 2030.\nThe funding freeze is the latest in a spate of bad news flung at the electric vehicle sector and the wider auto sector. In just his first month in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at ‚Äúterminat[ing] ‚Ä¶ the electric vehicle mandate‚Äù and contemplated high tariffs against Canadian, Mexican, and European goods. Collectively, these moves could devastate the global auto industry.\nThe EV charging freeze has thrown the still-fledgling charger industry into confusion. Legal experts say the move could be against the law. Still, industry observers say the pause in funding likely won‚Äôt spell doom for the nation‚Äôs charging infrastructure‚Äîor the wider goal of getting more people into electric cars.\n‚ÄúThe industry is not dependent on this,‚Äù says Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, an EV charging data-analytics firm. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre building out charging infrastructure anyway.‚Äù\nFunding Confusion\nThe three-year-old National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program is funded by the federal government. But it is administrated by individual states, meaning state officials are responsible for planning charging sites and writing contracts with companies to build and operate them.\nSome of those state officials are still evaluating what the funding freeze means for them. The state of Ohio has built 19 stations with NEVI funding‚Äîone third of the 57 already open nationwide. The state is ‚Äúworking to understand the specific funding impacts of the new guidance as it applies to our remaining contracted projects,‚Äù Breanna Badanes, a spokesperson for the Ohio DOT‚Äôs charging initiative, wrote to WIRED in a statement.\nIn general, states seem to believe that they can move forward with projects where contracts have already been signed, but can‚Äôt sign any more, even if they‚Äôve already been awarded the money to build. ‚ÄúWhat's going to happen is, any obligations that have been currently made, contracts that have been signed, those are still going to be funded,‚Äù US transportation secretary Sean Duffy told Fox Business over the weekend. He acknowledged that killing the NEVI program would require an act of Congress. But he said no more funding will be released until the Transportation Department reevaluates the program. That process likely won‚Äôt be completed for several months.\nThe Price of Delay?\nIn the near term, the delay in NEVI funding may be hardly noticeable to EV drivers. For one thing, NEVI-funded chargers are ‚Äúa drop in the bucket‚Äù of the nation‚Äôs budding charging infrastructure, says McDonald, the analyst. He estimates that NEVI-funded electric fast-charging ports will account for some 10 or 15 percent of the 16,000-odd due to come online in the US this year. If states follow through with sites that already have contracts, some 750 to 850 of the 1,000 planned NEVI sites will open, McDonald says.\nFor another, the NEVI program was designed to build chargers that aren‚Äôt always close to where most EV owners live. The rules of the program (which could be changed now that it‚Äôs under review) stipulate that the money be used to build stations every 50 miles along high-traffic stretches of national highway. The idea was that the government would subsidize public fast-charging in places where the market might not support it, to enable long-distance trips. But most people aren‚Äôt taking daily road trips, so they may not immediately notice the delay in construction. Those who do notice might be rural drivers.\nIn the longer term, the freeze will likely hit a few charging companies in the pocketbook. A handful of firms have built their profit strategies around big funding opportunities like NEVI. ‚ÄúThe freeze does really have an impact on how much infrastructure gets to roll out,‚Äù says Jeremy Michalek, professor of engineering and public policy who studies electric vehicles at Carnegie Mellon University. ‚ÄúIt puts some players in a bad spot where they‚Äôve already invested.‚Äù\nBut other companies, including Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla, have opted to use NEVI funds to build only some of their chargers, and others have declined to use the funding opportunity at all. This is in part because stations built with the first tranche of NEVI money are required to be positioned in those 50-mile intervals. Charging companies see more opportunity in other locations.\nIonna, a joint venture between eight major automakers focused on charging, applied for no NEVI funding, and still plans to open more than 1,000 charging ports this year, with a goal of building 30,000 by 2030. ‚ÄúThe team has not stopped,‚Äù spokesperson Katherine Rankin wrote in a statement.\nIonna is less interested in NEVI funding because it wants to build chargers in metropolitan areas, CEO Seth Cutler explained at an industry forum earlier this month. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of need for that right now,‚Äù he said, pointing to data that the charging company collects on EV registrations and current charger use. Cities are where the company expects to find its future customers‚Äîpeople who live in apartments, or without off-street parking, or in homes with less-than-ideal electricity hookups that prevent them from charging overnight in the garage.\nWalmart, too, is quietly building its own ‚Äúcoast-to-coast‚Äù network of chargers. The ride-hail turned charging station firm Revel is also focused on building in cities, where governments are pushing Uber and Lyft to put their drivers in electric cars. Just a few days ago, the company won a $60 million state grant to put nearly 300 new fast chargers in New York.\nIn the long term, then, the NEVI pause could have the greatest effect on the vibes around electric vehicles, rather than the actual experience of owning one. Freezing the program might have already accomplished what the Trump administration really wants, points out McDonald, the analyst: widespread confusion.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the messaging: creating chaos and havoc and getting the headlines,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúGetting everyone in hysterics about canceling this charging program could appease the followers who think EVs are evil.‚Äù The antidote might be sticking to the facts.",

    "content_text": "Twenty-six days after it was banished from US app stores, TikTok has returned to the iOS App Store and Google Play store. Apple and Google brought back the Chinese-owned video app after receiving a letter from US attorney general Pam Bondi assuring the companies they would not be fined for hosting it, Bloomberg first reported Thursday.\nGoogle confirmed to WIRED it has brought TikTok back, but didn‚Äôt immediately elaborate on the reason. Apple, TikTok, and the Department of Justice didn‚Äôt immediately respond to requests for comment. Bondi was sworn into office last week.\nThe return concludes a fraught few weeks for TikTok. The platform disappeared from US app stores and went dark for users nationwide on January 19, hours before the ban went into effect. It sputtered back to life later that day, after TikTok executives received their own assurances from then president-elect Donald Trump that he would provide more time for a resolution to be reached. If you already had the app on your phone, it was functioning normally by that same afternoon.\nAfter Trump took office on January 20, one of his first executive orders gave TikTok a reprieve. ‚ÄúI am instructing the Attorney General not to take any action to enforce the Act for a period of 75 days from today to allow my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward,‚Äù the order reads.\nGoogle and Apple, however, continued to keep TikTok out of their marketplaces, meaning new users couldn‚Äôt install it. That‚Äôs because the law that undergirds the TikTok ban‚Äîthe Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA)‚Äîsays that American tech companies can‚Äôt ‚Äúdistribute, maintain, or update‚Äù any apps from ByteDance, TikTok‚Äôs parent company. Those that do face the prospect of hefty fines. That means not just TikTok but a dozen or so apps, including popular offerings like Lemon8, CapCut, and Marvel Snap, have been unavailable to download for over three weeks. (Those apps also returned to the app stores on Thursday.)\nWhile TikTok was unavailable, users searching for it on the iOS App Store were greeted by the following message: ‚ÄúTikTok and other ByteDance apps are not available in the country or region you‚Äôre in.‚Äù A ‚ÄúLearn more‚Äù link sent users to a long article explaining why the app was gone and a reminder that they wouldn‚Äôt receive any updates for as long as the ban was in place. The Google Play Store, meanwhile, said, ‚ÄúDownloads for this app are paused due to current US legal requirements.‚Äù Searchers were directed to competitor apps, several of which saw a bump in usage.\nPAFACA allows the president to extend the deadline for banning TikTok by 90 days if he certifies to Congress that ‚Äúsignificant progress‚Äù has been made toward a deal to sell the app to a non-Chinese company.\nRight before taking office, Trump proposed that the US could have 50 percent ownership of TikTok, without specifying what he meant. The president reportedly recently tapped Vice President JD Vance to lead the negotiations between ByteDance and potential buyers. One reported scenario would involve Oracle and a group of other investors taking control of the platform.\nA few other bidders emerged before Trump took office, including billionaire Frank McCourt and, reportedly, AI search startup Perplexity, but ByteDance hasn‚Äôt said publicly whether it is willing to make a deal. TikTok‚Äôs parent company may want to retain the TikTok algorithm in the event of an eventual sale, and it‚Äôs not clear what TikTok would look like‚Äîor be worth‚Äîwithout it.\nOn Thursday, Trump told reporters in televised remarks that he expected the deal process to conclude before his 75-day reprieve expires in April, but that he was open to extending the deadline. \"We have a lot of people interested in TikTok, and I hope to be able to make a deal,\" he said. \"We'll probably have to get approval from China to do it ‚Ä¶ but it's to their benefit too.\"\nPAFACA remains on the books, and still requires TikTok to be banned if the company is unable to divest from ByteDance by the time the extension runs out. Republican senators previously spoke out against extending the timeline for the app. ‚ÄúNow that the law has taken effect, there‚Äôs no legal basis for any kind of ‚Äòextension‚Äô of its effective date,‚Äù senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska said in a statement in January.\nAdditional reporting by Brian Barrett.",

    "content_text": "Thanks to their excellent smelling ability, dogs have been used for hundreds of years to hunt down wild game and search for criminals. At airports, they help identify explosives and illicit drugs. In disaster situations, they can rescue survivors and find human remains.\nBut each dog can only be trained to detect one class of odor compounds, which limits the range of smells it‚Äôs able to detect. Training costs tens of thousands of dollars and takes several months. For Florida startup Canaery, the solution is merging canines with neurotechnology to allow them to detect everything from bombs and other contraband to human diseases and environmental toxins‚Äîno specialized training needed.\nThe company is building what it calls a nose‚Äìcomputer interface to decode odors that an animal smells in real time. ‚ÄúHow much easier would it be if you just had to press a button and take a vapor sample and instantly get a readout?‚Äù says Canaery‚Äôs CEO Gabriel Lavella. (And yes, the company takes its name from the yellow bird once used to detect toxic gases in coal mines.)\nA handful of firms, including Elon Musk‚Äôs Neuralink, are building brain‚Äìcomputer interfaces for humans. Canaery wants to bring the same technology to dogs.\nThe company has partnered with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy, to develop an array that reads odor information taken from animals. Thinner than a piece of tissue paper and a quarter the size of a US postage stamp, it‚Äôs placed on the surface of the animal‚Äôs olfactory bulb‚Äîthe brain‚Äôs receiving center for smell. When an animal picks up a scent, neurons fire in the olfactory bulb. The array collects these neural signals and sends them to a small, wireless computer unit that decodes them.\nSo far the array has been tested in rats, with a version for dogs coming later, Lavella says. In a demo video viewed exclusively by WIRED, a Canaery scientist uses a wand to capture an air sample from four different petri dishes, each containing a different odorant. The wand beeps and sends the odor molecules through a tube to a pod that houses a rat equipped with the nose‚Äìcomputer interface. A few seconds after the animal smells the odor, the scent information is sent to a phone that sits on top of the pod. A mobile app displays the name of the compound the animal smells, as well as a quality score that takes into account the accuracy and the concentration of molecules.\nCurrently, Canaery‚Äôs rat prototype can detect arson accelerants and smokeless powder used in ammunition, as well as methamphetamine, cocaine, and fentanyl.\nIn mammals, the nose and brain work together to detect smells. When odor molecules enter the nostrils, they bind to olfactory receptors. Humans have about 450 types of olfactory receptors, while dogs have twice as many. Every odor stimulates different combinations of receptor types, producing a unique electrical signal. That signal is sent to the olfactory bulb to be processed. Lavella likens the surface of the olfactory bulb to a checkerboard. When an odor comes in, squares light up on the checkerboard in a specific pattern.\nCanaery uses AI software to recognize those patterns and associate them with odors. After implanting the array, scientists expose the animal to an odor to train the AI models. Lavella says the software can be trained in about three sessions. During those sessions, scientists present more than two dozen samples of the same odor to the animal. Later, the animal is exposed to the odor again to validate the AI models.\nThe current array that‚Äôs implanted in the demo rat has 128 electrodes that capture neural signals from the olfactory bulb. Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are working on a new array with 767 electrodes to capture more information. ‚ÄúThat next-generation device will allow us to have greater performance in the field against complex background odors and confounding vapors that are in the air,‚Äù Lavella says.\nDecoding smell isn‚Äôt a new endeavor by any means. Researchers have been working on ‚Äúe-nose‚Äù technology to detect odors for the past 40 years. These devices use chemical sensors to convert odor molecules into electric signals, which are then analyzed by a pattern-recognition system to identify the odor source. But these devices historically have been able to detect only a small range of odors.\n‚ÄúAnimals can do things that we can‚Äôt get current sensors to do, so that‚Äôs a smart way to get around that problem,‚Äù says Joel Mainland, an olfaction researcher at the Monell Chemical Senses Center, a nonprofit research institute in Philadelphia.\nMatt Angle, CEO of Austin-based Paradromics, which is developing a brain-computer interface for humans, says the technology is a pragmatic way to digitize smell because ‚Äúit leverages the very hard-to-engineer physiology of olfaction while still getting the benefit of digitization and rapid analysis.‚Äù\nCanaery and its collaborators imagine all kinds of uses for its odor-detection system. ‚ÄúAirports and other forms of checkpoints are probably the most obvious use case,‚Äù says Travis Massey, a neural interface researcher at Lawrence Livermore. The nose-computer interface could be used to sniff out people entering schools, stadiums, shopping malls, or amusement parks‚Äîanyplace where a large number of people are gathering.\nOther applications could include detecting invasive species, identifying environmental hazards, or diagnosing diseases. During the Covid-19 pandemic, dogs were trained to successfully sniff out the coronavirus in patient samples of sweat, saliva, and urine. Other diseases, such as cancer and Parkinson‚Äôs disease, produce unique odor signatures that can be detected by sniffer dogs. Hotel chains even use dogs to find bed bug infestations.\nBut installing a nose-computer interface in dogs no doubt raises questions about safety and animal welfare. In rats, the array can be inserted into the nose via a minimally invasive procedure. The company is still working out how to implant the device in dogs. At least in rats, the array doesn‚Äôt damage tissue or elicit a strong immune response. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt anticipate any longevity issues or chronic issues having an effect on the animal‚Äôs quality of life,‚Äù Lavella says.\nHuman brain-computer interfaces involve some amount of risk, but they‚Äôre also designed to restore functionality for people with paralysis and treat other medical conditions. Those risks may be acceptable to the people using them. Canaery‚Äôs nose-computer interface, however, would be implanted in an otherwise healthy animal. Ultimately, the benefits of the technology will have to be weighed against any potential risks to man‚Äôs best friend.",

However, when the site finally came online Thursday morning, it turned out to be little more than a glorified feed of posts from the official DOGE account on Musk‚Äôs own X platform, raising new questions about Musk‚Äôs conflicts of interest in running DOGE.\nDOGE.gov claims to be an ‚Äúofficial website of the United States government,‚Äù but rather than giving detailed breakdowns of the cost savings and efficiencies Musk claims his project is making, the homepage of the site just replicated posts from the DOGE account on X.\nA WIRED review of the page‚Äôs source code shows that the promotion of Musk‚Äôs own platform went deeper than replicating the posts on the homepage. The source code shows that the site‚Äôs canonical tags direct search engines to x.com rather than DOGE.gov.\nA canonical tag is a snippet of code that tells search engines what the authoritative version of a website is. It is typically used by sites with multiple pages as a search engine optimization tactic, to avoid their search ranking being diluted.\nIn DOGE‚Äôs case, however, the code is informing search engines that when people search for content found on DOGE.gov, they should not show those pages in search results, but should instead display the posts on X.\n‚ÄúIt is promoting the X account as the main source, with the website secondary,‚Äù Declan Chidlow, a web developer, tells WIRED. ‚ÄúThis isn't usually how things are handled, and it indicates that the X account is taking priority over the actual website itself.‚Äù\nAll the other US government websites WIRED checked used their own homepage in their canonical tags, including the official White House website.

So far the page is empty except for a single line that reads: ‚ÄúReceipts coming soon, no later than Valentine's day,‚Äù followed by a heart emoji.\nA section entitled ‚ÄúWorkforce‚Äù features some bar charts showing how many people work in each government agency, with the information coming from data gathered by the Office of Personnel Management in March 2024.\nA disclaimer at the bottom of the page reads: ‚ÄúThis is DOGE's effort to create a comprehensive, government-wide org chart. This is an enormous effort, and there are likely some errors or omissions. We will continue to strive for maximum accuracy over time.‚Äù\nAnother section, entitled ‚ÄúRegulations,‚Äù features what DOGE calls the ‚ÄúUnconstitutionality Index,‚Äù which it describes as ‚Äúthe number of agency rules created by unelected bureaucrats for each law passed by Congress in 2024.‚Äù\nThe charts in this section are also based on data previously collected by US government agencies. Doge.gov also links to a Forbes article from last month that was written by Clyde Wayne Crews, a member of the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank that pushed climate change disinformation and questioned the links between tobacco and lung cancer. It is also a major advocate for privatizing government departments.\nThe site also features a ‚ÄúJoin‚Äù page which allows prospective DOGE employees to apply for roles including ‚Äúsoftware engineers, InfoSec engineers, and other technology professionals.‚Äù As well as requesting a Github account and r√©sum√©, the form asks visitors to ‚Äúprovide 2-3 bullet points showcasing exceptional ability.‚Äù\nThe website does not list a developer, but on Wednesday, web application security expert Sam Curry outlined in a thread on X how he was able to identify the developer of the site as DOGE employee Kyle Shutt.\nCurry claims he was able to link a Cloudflare account ID found in the site‚Äôs source code to Shutt, who used the same account when developing Musk‚Äôs America PAC website.\nOn Thursday, Drop Site News reported, citing sources within FEMA, that Shutt had gained access to the agency‚Äôs proprietary software controlling payments. Earlier this week, Business Insider reported that Shutt, who recently worked at an AI interviewing software company, was listed as one of 30 people working for DOGE.\nNeither Shutt, DOGE, nor the White House responded to requests for comment.",

    "content_text": "Dating apps have evolved a lot over the years, with apps dedicated to any romantic niche‚Äîdog lovers, astrology heads, and big, bushy beards. Despite the seemingly endless options of dating platforms, the industry seems to be at a low. So this week, we talk about the current state of dating apps and what it means for those looking for love (or something like it).\nYou can follow Michael Calore on Bluesky at @snackfight, Lauren Goode on Bluesky at @laurengoode, and Zo√´ Schiffer on Threads @reporterzoe. Write to us at uncannyvalley@wired.com.\nHow to Listen\nYou can always listen to this week's podcast through the audio player on this page, but if you want to subscribe for free to get every episode, here's how:\nIf you're on an iPhone or iPad, open the app called Podcasts, or just tap this link. You can also download an app like Overcast or Pocket Casts and search for ‚ÄúUncanny Valley.‚Äù We‚Äôre on Spotify too.\nTranscript\nNote: This is an automated transcript, which may contain errors.\nMichael Calore: All right, so this is the season of romance. It's February, Valentine's Day is coming up. Zo√´, how are you spending this weekend?\nZo√´ Schiffer: My husband and I aren't great at either remembering or celebrating Valentine's. The same goes for our anniversary; we've never once, not once, remembered that it existed. This year, we're going to a friend's house and we're going to have a kid-free dinner‚Äîwhich honestly, nothing is more romantic to me than an evening without my children, as much as I love them. What about you, Mike? What are you going to do?\nMichael Calore: We sort of already celebrated. We went away a couple of weekends ago, and that felt right, because we were able to sidestep all of the madness of reservations and making plans and things like that. So we're doing the same thing actually, we're going to a friend's house and we're having a meal in. Lauren, what are you up to?\nLauren Goode: I'm going to leave it a little open-ended. That way, my plans are either extremely exciting or they're extremely boring. But I'm going to leave it in the murky middle so that our listeners can just guess. I saw a celebrity say that once in an interview, if you just don't tell people what you're up to, they think your life is incredibly boring, and actually it's quite interesting.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Love that.\nMichael Calore: That's wonderful. Well, we are talking about romance this week, so I think this is a good place to dive into dating apps.\nLauren Goode: Let's do it.\nZo√´ Schiffer: The most romantic thing of all, swiping.\nMichael Calore: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture, here at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: And I'm Lauren Goode, I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nZo√´ Schiffer: I'm Zo√´ Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nMichael Calore: Today we are talking about the current state of dating apps. The apps have evolved a lot over the years. There are now apps where you can meet dog lovers, astrology heads, fans of live music. Whatever your thing is, there's an app for that now. But zoom out from those swipe-right moments, and you're looking in an ecosystem of niche platforms and algorithms that are just as delicate and turbulent as love itself. As the industry seems to be at its all-time worst, we're wondering, could this be a corrective moment for dating apps? So what's going on with online dating right now? What's the current state out there, of the apps and the scene? What are people doing?\nLauren Goode: I was really worried going into this episode, that you guys were just going to be like, ‚ÄúSo Lauren, tell us.‚Äù You attached people.\nZo√´ Schiffer: As a correspondent in the field.\nLauren Goode: Yes. Oh, good God.\nMichael Calore: We did jump on that first question, I must say.\nLauren Goode: Well, yeah. So something like 30 percent of adults in the United States have used dating apps, that's according to a recent survey by Pew Research Center. The biggest ones you've probably heard of: Bumble, Hinge, and Tinder. For a while, in the early aughts, we heard about companies like Match, eHarmony, OkCupid. Match is still in the game. In fact, Match is now Match Group, which owns a whole bunch of these name-brand dating apps that you've heard of. Tinder is 36 percent of the total monthly active users in the United States. And Tinder, I think, we're going to be talking about a lot in this first part of this podcast, because of the way that Tinder kind of revolutionized mobile dating apps. Most of these apps start out free, but it's kind of like a mobile game, in that they're becoming increasingly gamified. You're encouraged to make in-app purchases, but in this case, you're buying access to virtual likes from other human beings. So that's the dystopian state of dating right now.\nMichael Calore: So in the free experience, you're swiping and you're seeing people, and at some point, you stop seeing people who are good matches for you and it just becomes sort of a sea of faces, right?\nLauren Goode: Yeah. So for example, within the free version of Hinge, if you get a bunch of likes, you can only see one at a time, and you have to decide in that moment if you're going to reject someone or accept them as someone you want to chat with. And so that kind of limits you in terms of the context you can put that person into. You don't have the ability to say, ‚ÄúWell, my other matches actually look better,‚Äù because you just can't see them until you pay for the premium version.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Some of these apps also use some form of dynamic pricing too, so they're able to sort of bucket you and identify whether you'd pay a little bit more, what market you live in, what age group you're in. The whole experience has become, I think, increasingly inauthentic and kind of spammy.\nMichael Calore: So it's not all Bumble and Hinge and Tinder, there are now a whole host of dating apps that are just for people who are into a very specific thing, or people who want to meet somebody like-minded in a community that they're a part of. There are apps for people who like jam bands, and there are apps for people who like to go to hip-hop concerts. And there are even apps where men with beards can connect with men and women who like men with beards.\nLauren Goode: No.\nMichael Calore: It's called Bristlr.\nLauren Goode: No.\nZo√´ Schiffer: No.\nLauren Goode: This can't be real life. Really?\nMichael Calore: Oh, it is real life. Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Wow.\nMichael Calore: Specifically, you must have facial hair. And then there's Veggly, which is for vegans to get together, because nothing's more awkward than going out on a date and a person takes you to a restaurant where the only thing you can eat is the beet salad.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, that's a bummer.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Well, it seems like what you're describing though are these very, very niche apps, and I think there's also this space that's in between the big ones, Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and those hyper-specific ones, because there are apps that everyone's heard of before, even though they have a specific purpose like Raya, which is for influencers who love other influencers and Feeld, which is for non-monogamous or non-traditional relationships, or ones that are specific to religious values like a Jdate or Christian Dating, or Salams. Those are specific, but they're not like, ‚ÄúI like beards.‚Äù I feel like that's a different category.\nZo√´ Schiffer: I like beards feels universal. I was going to make a joke that that's the universal dating app. I'm like, ‚ÄúWho doesn't love a beard? Come on.‚Äù That's not niche. I interviewed these Stanford students a few years back, who'd created an app based on the matching algorithm for medical schools. Their whole thesis was, dating apps are not good at predicting chemistry, which I think anyone who's been on a dating app would attest to. And so they wanted to create a questionnaire that all Stanford students could participate in, and then you'd have Match Day at Stanford, which became a legit campus-wide event where you'd get your one single match. And people would be running across campus screaming. They would meet up, go on dates, couples would form, friendships would form. It was a pretty cool kind of IRL hybrid dating app experience that these students kicked off, that went on for years.\nLauren Goode: That sounds absolutely delightful and also absolutely Stanford, and I love it. They're like, ‚ÄúLet's take the med school algo and apply it to our love lives.‚Äù We also haven't mentioned Grindr, which of course, is the massively popular LGBTQ app. And we mentioned it on an earlier episode of Uncanny Valley‚Äî\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yes, we did.\nLauren Goode: ... because it set a precedent for Supreme Court ruling.\nZo√´ Schiffer: It was the original dating app, right? This was the first one.\nLauren Goode: Before Tinder or after Tinder?\nZo√´ Schiffer: No, I think they were around before.\nLauren Goode: It was before? OK. Yeah, really just a pioneer.\nMichael Calore: There are literally hundreds of apps for whatever you're looking for. But let's put all of them on a timeline, because I feel like if you look at the last 15 years or so of online dating, you can see two pretty fundamental shifts in the way that these apps work. One's clearly about technology, right? The rise of smartphones, and the fact that you can download these mobile apps onto your phone, carry them around in your pocket, and spend five minutes on the bus or two minutes standing in line at the grocery store swiping through potential mates, and the swipe-right/swipe-left dynamic really comes to the foreground in this era and becomes sort of the standard across all the dating apps. Then you have the pandemic in 2020 and shelter in place, when meeting people in real life became much harder, and literally everything about dating moved online. So let's first start by talking about the dating app scene pre-pandemic. What did the app industry look like before 2020?\nZo√´ Schiffer: I mean, my understanding of this era of dating was that it was very ... The dominant players were eHarmony, OkCupid, these desktop experiences that ask for a lot more information upfront. You get pretty robust profiles of people.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I think that's the first time they were kind of branded, because since the beginning of chat rooms, people have been all ASL, right?\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I feel like the friends that I have that still prefer the eHarmony experience, do so because they feel like they get a much better sense of people, where the newer apps have these prompts, you get very short snippets and it's more photo dominant, so it's like people put less time into the profiles, and you have to swipe a lot more to understand what the field is like, what the individual is like.\nMichael Calore: There were other big platforms too. There was Yahoo Personals, Nerve.com Personals, Craigslist‚Äîlet's give a shout-out to all the Craigslist couples out there in the world.\nLauren Goode: Missed Connections and everything else going on there.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Oh, Missed Connections. Oh my gosh.\nLauren Goode: They were the original meet-cute on the internet.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, they were.\nLauren Goode: When I was in college, my senior year in college, this is the early 2000s, one of my housemates decided that she was tired of the dating pool on our pretty small campus, so she got on Yahoo ... I don't remember if it was called Yahoo Dating or Yahoo Personals, but it was the first time that I had ever laid eyes on an online dating profile, it was my friend's. And we thought she was going to get murdered actually, because that was the perception of dating apps, they weren't completely normalized. It was embarrassing to say you were looking online a little bit. There was this stigma attached. Also she was fine, folks, for what it's worth. But yeah, I think to your point, Mike, the mobile revolution really changed all of that. It changed the mechanics, the dynamics, and it changed the stigma.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. And here's where we have to talk about Tinder, because in the smartphone era with the touchscreen, swipe right, swipe left really became the dominant way to search for that needle in the haystack, so to speak.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Right, yeah. And then it became much more of a numbers game, it feels like. You could just continue swiping seemingly forever in order to try and find your match. But the downside of that is the pool feeling endless, makes it harder to know when to stop.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. And one thing that often gets overlooked is the importance of geolocation in these apps because you can filter for distance. You can say, I'm only interested in seeing people who are 10 miles away from me. I'm only interested in seeing people who are 50 miles away from me. So if you live in a city and you don't have a car, or if you live out in the boonies and there's not a big pool, you can adjust the location settings to find out how many people are actually out there.\nZo√´ Schiffer: That was really the thing that Grindr pioneered, I think, which was not just telling you who is interested, but who is interested in your immediate proximity and making it easier to find and hook up with people, which every app since, seems to have copied.\nMichael Calore: So around this time that we're talking about, a lot of these apps are free, and then there was a shift when they all started charging for premium subscription features.\nZo√´ Schiffer: We have to pause here because these companies are largely venture-backed and their investors want them, obviously, to earn money or continue earning money. And the way to do that, once you've saturated the immediate obvious dating pool, is just up charging your existing user base. And so we see the apps start to change in significant ways that have important implications for the goals of the company and then the goals of their users, and how those goals might actually conflict.\nLauren Goode: Right. I think what you're saying is that the incentives totally change.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: I mean, it's hard to say if they ever really wanted you to find true love to begin with. Whether you're an ad-based free website or you're charging a subscription fee, the goal is really, let's keep you swiping, let's keep you tapping, because we want to make money.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, when I was reporting on dating apps, one of the questions that I would always ask employees who worked at these companies was, do you have a metric that you track in terms of how many couples are actually getting and staying together from these apps? And it's different app by app. I think Tinder and Grindr, the perception was they were more to find people to hook up with, not necessarily lasting love, but for the other ones it was, is there a KPI that your company is tracking that you have up on the wall that you're measured against whether people find lasting love, or is it minutes spent on the app? Because I think that that's critically important for understanding whether your goal is aligned with the user's goal.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. So how safe did the apps feel in this era? I mean, it's not often that we get to look back and sort of chart how safe we were feeling at certain times, but I feel like dating apps offer an opportunity to do that, because we all kind of remember the scandals, and we remember the experiences that we and our friends had during this era.\nLauren Goode: I do still think that even after mobile dating apps became incredibly popular, there was still a stigma around them, and part of that was vulnerable populations feeling especially vulnerable out there. There's this meme that floats around the internet where there's a woman saying to her friend, ‚ÄúHey, just in case I end up murdered, his name was Alex. He lives in this part of town. Here's a photo.‚Äù Sending all the data from the app. And the friend goes, ‚ÄúGreat, have fun.‚Äù So now I think that's just kind of a more accepted part of dating apps. We have names and ideas around what those experiences are, whether it's catfishing for example, or now there's a new type of scam called pig butchering. And I think by the time you are giving a name to something, it is normalized, it's codified at that point. It's not sort of this nebulous idea of, oh, dating app is danger.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Right.\nLauren Goode: Still very real concerns, but it was different about a decade ago.\nZo√´ Schiffer: It was different, and I think now there's more literacy on what the dangers are, how to protect yourself, what you're getting into when you use the apps. This was a more innocent era of the internet generally, we were couch-surfing, taking rides from random people. There was a way to connect with strangers and engage with them in all sorts of ways that I think now we're a little more suspect of, but at the time was like, ‚ÄúWow, the internet's amazing. You can find anyone.‚Äù\nMichael Calore: Smartphones are amazing.\nLauren Goode: You were fist-bumping your Lyft driver with a pink mustache on its card. That is not a euphemism.\nMichael Calore: I never did that by the way. I always offered my elbow.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Mike knew right away, that that was lame.\nMichael Calore: I would just offer my elbow. I'd say, how about we elbow bump? OK, so now we're at the pandemic, right? 2020 rolls around. All of a sudden everybody's stuck at home, people start getting a little lonely and they're swiping like crazy.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, so during the pandemic, dating apps expanded, their businesses grew similar to the other online services that we were completely tethered to, like Netflix and Zoom. Match Group in particular, which I mentioned earlier, owns a bunch of apps, include Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, OkCupid, BLK; they had 17 percent higher revenue in the first year of the pandemic. They used it as an opportunity to push out new features and different subscription levels. That was also when they were introducing new safety guides. And then they leaned on video calls, because we were all on video chats anyway. So it was also a moment where culturally, video chatting first became kind of normal and then, I don't know the exact data on this, but I think even now it's a little bit more common for someone to say, well, why don't we video chat first before we kind of take the time to meet up in person and potentially experience disappointment in person?\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah. And once again, this wasn't at the time seen as a momentary bump because of the pandemic. A lot of tech companies and dating apps that were part of this kind of assumed maybe this is the new normal. Our user bases have ballooned, we're raking in money. This is the golden era, and it's going to continue. And so then when it did not continue, and there was a pullback in the dating app industry, people didn't want to be online all the time or on their phones all the time, the companies themselves had to recalibrate and start finding new ways to squeeze money out of people.\nLauren Goode: And can I just give credit to our producer here for a moment? She sent along a data point that said on March 29th, there was a one-day record for the app, Tinder users swiped through more than 3 billion potential matches in one day. But this makes me laugh, because it's March 29th, 2021. So I just want to go back and be like, ‚ÄúKids, the vaccines are coming. They're coming. You're almost out of this.‚Äù\nZo√´ Schiffer: You don't have to do this.\nMichael Calore: Well, I think the best thing to happen around dating apps because of this pandemic bump was that the stigma pretty much went away. All of a sudden it was just OK because everybody was on dating apps. And it was OK to talk about it, and it was OK to meet people there who maybe you weren't interested in dating, but you just wanted to chat with them because you feel like you could get along. And to the point we were talking about earlier with Feeld, there were a lot of people who were sort of open to a new experience. They're trapped with their partners in their houses and they're dealing with all of their relationship issues, and maybe now it's time for them to branch out, and the safe way to do that feels like signing onto a new kind of app that's going to fulfill a new need that they now understand that they have.\nLauren Goode: Right.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah. It's vulnerable to put yourself out there and say that you're looking for something that you might not get. And so when everyone else is admitting that they're also looking for that thing, which is basically the human experience, I feel like we're all looking desperately for love. Yeah, there's a huge normalizing factor that comes into play.\nMichael Calore: OK, let's take a break and come right back.\n[break]\nMichael Calore: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. So dating apps are on the rise during the pandemic and are still booming afterwards. So what are some of the features that we saw introduced during this app boom?\nLauren Goode: Well, we can't have this conversation without talking about AI. And I think it's important to make the distinction between the different flavors of AI that we've seen in dating apps. I think ever since we've had access to advanced Photoshop or the app Facetune, people have technically been using forms of AI to put themselves out there or outright catfish people. We've also seen the emergence of bots, which is you're chatting with a person in the app and you have a sense that they're not actually a person or they're a person who's been using some kind of tool to chat with you. Now in a lot of instances, the companies themselves are using AI as well, and they're either using it because they're doing things like identity verification or they're using it to spot harmful communication, spam, abusive language, that sort of thing. And now some of the apps themselves have actually just sort of co-opted the idea of chatbots and said, well, we're just going to introduce our own version of an AI chatbot that you can use to do the conversations for you. I think that's the weirdest thing, just personally, that it's gotten to that point within dating apps. I know Snapchat has a version of this too, My AI, and some of the teens are into it and all that stuff. So I just think that's one of the most desperate things you can do as a company, which is, we're going to take this fundamentally human experience, we know our incentives have been kind of misaligned with what you want for a while, but we've danced around it and now we're just explicitly saying, look, we're going to do anything we can do to keep you chatting, chatting, chatting, chatting, and just to keep you in the app.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, I feel like when we talk about AI and dating apps, the assumption is that it would be used explicitly to improve the algorithm to find you better matches. So the idea that no in fact, Grindr is really not the AI wingman, so you can kind of have a dating coach to chat with, or the Bumble founder who said that in a future state, maybe just AI avatars will date each other is surprising, which there are people who chat with chatbots all day for therapy purposes or in relationships with them, so it's not to say there's not a use case for this, but to me, it wasn't the expected application of AI, and it does seem like the goal is, can we upsell our existing user base? I also just wanted to have a little caveat around catfishing, because the line between catfishing and then whatever else we all do all the time feels surprisingly thin to me. I feel like there have been so many times where I put up a photo and I was like, ‚ÄúThis is not typical. This is me absolutely hoodwinking whoever sees this picture.‚Äù\nLauren Goode: Yes. We see a lot of high ‚Ä¶ And we do a lot of high-gloss images on LinkedIn now, for example, and it's like‚Äî\nZo√´ Schiffer: A good angle? That can be a ‚Ä¶ Anyway, I don't want to get this off-topic.\nMichael Calore: Well, Zo√´, I mean you hit on a good point, which is the fact that the upsell is getting really, really outrageous now. The fact that you have to pay sometimes $30 a month just to unlock the ability to see who's looking at your profile or to chat with more than one person at a time, it's really contributing to this sort of distaste for dating apps now. I feel like a lot of people are feeling fatigued, they're feeling overwhelmed, and they're feeling like they're just not getting as much out of the apps as they used to because of all this stuff that's being added.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, it feels like we were kind of ‚Ä¶ I mean, what we were talking about before, the pandemic felt like peak dating app era, and now it seems like there's been a bit of a backlash where the companies are trying to upsell users more and more, and users are getting a little upset and fatigued with the business model.\nLauren Goode: I also think in general, the bar for what's considered successful on these apps is pretty low and maybe has gotten lower. There's this great book called Dataclysm, and it's written by the cofounder of OkCupid. I must admit, I haven't read all of it, I skimmed it, but it's fascinating and it's really well written too. And because he has access to all of this data, he gives this really incredible sociological snapshot of dating apps. And one of the things that it points out is that men are less discerning than women. They'll like, like, like a whole bunch of profiles, so their rejection rates tend to be higher. Women will often vocalize how \"bad\" dating apps are. And it's true, and we also worry about safety. But I think men overall have a worse experience just in terms of rejection. This book also points out that men think women are sort of generally more attractive. There are societal stereotypes around women. If women have a lot of tattoos, it says this about them. If women are over 40, it says this about them. But despite that, on the scale of attractiveness, men tend to rate women a lot higher, and women find these very specific subsets on dating apps attractive, and then it just sort of falls off a cliff. The line he uses in this book is basically at that point after that, women think 58 percent of men are brain-damaged.\nZo√´ Schiffer: My gosh.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. So there's a lot of discrimination against certain groups of people. Black women, Asian men, tend to have the worst experiences on dating apps. So what's happening here is that the apps or the companies that make the apps don't actually care if you find a ‚Äúpartner.‚Äù They're aware of these discriminations that exist amongst the groups, and what they're trying to do is just have you have enough matches that it keeps you on the apps. So they algorithmically create these clusters for you based on all of that, and just hope you get a few dates here and there because that's a thing that will make you think, well, I might as well just keep the app on my phone. To get back to the original point, they don't really care if you find a long-term partnership from the app.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Wasn't there also reporting a while back that apps like Tinder, at least at one point, gave you a score that was where you ranked overall in the app? It felt like the LO score or something that was related to chess.\nLauren Goode: Like an Uber rating? That's brutal.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, it was like, everyone was kind of curious about what does Tinder think on the backend about my overall attractiveness? And it was based on perhaps the company's own assessment of you, but also how people interacted with your profile, which is just kind of fascinating.\nLauren Goode: Wow.\nMichael Calore: Woof.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: How have the scams gotten worse? Lauren, I know you have done a lot of reporting about this, so I want to put you on the spot.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I did some reporting for WIRED in 2022 about this category of scams that is known as pig-butchering scams. The idea is that these bad actors on the apps are taking a long time to chat with you and sort of fatten you up, and convince you that they're really interested in you personally and romantically, and ultimately what they're interested in is money. And so they'll often say things like, ‚ÄúWell, I run a trading platform on the side,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI'm really big into crypto and I can make you money from crypto.‚Äù And vulnerable people end up giving away their personal information and in some instances legitimately getting scammed. It's something that the FTC has been looking into. And we've written a lot about this at WIRED, Lily Hay Newman, our colleague has too, so I recommend that people go and check out those stories. I had this one experience where I was starting to notice this, people were popping up in Hinge, that appeared to just be very fake, and by fake, I mean they kind of had that face-tuned look, and some of the answers that they gave in their dating app profiles to these prompts that exist, the answers were nonsensical. And I brought it to one of my editors, our editor Tom, and I was like, ‚ÄúTom, this weird thing is happening.‚Äù We were running a whole package of stories on AI chatbots. So I said, well, I'm going to try to chat up some of these people, knowing that they're purporting to be someone they're not, and see what information I can get from them. And I ended up chatting with one in particular whose name was Paul. Spoiler, folks, his name was not Paul. I don't know what his name was, but he was not Paul.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Shocking.\nLauren Goode: He said he was German. I don't think Paul was German. He sent me a couple of photos where he was like, ‚ÄúLook, it's me in Germany.‚Äù And I just very quickly reverse Google image-searched it and it was in Barcelona, and I was like, ‚ÄúPaul, you're such a liar.‚Äù And then he was like, ‚ÄúLet's take this to Telegram,‚Äù which folks‚Äî\nZo√´ Schiffer: Never go to the second location.\nLauren Goode: ... not a good sign.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Never go to the second location.\nLauren Goode: I remember I signed up for Telegram, and one of my legit friends on Telegram got the notification that I signed up and he just texted, ‚ÄúWelcome to the dark side.‚Äù So I ended up chatting with this Paul, who we then in the newsroom started calling Paul Bot, for a few days, and asked him if he wanted to meet for coffee, knowing that the chances of that happening were zero, and he was like, ‚ÄúI would like to get to know you first.‚Äù I was like, ‚ÄúHe's such a gentleman.‚Äù And then one night I just said, I don't want to do this forever. So I finally just said, look, I mentioned I'm a writer, but I'm a journalist and I'm trying to better understand what's going on with these operations on dating apps, and I have a sense that you're not really who you say you are, but you might be working for someone, and I want to understand what you're doing. I didn't hear back, but then it was Saturday night, I was coming home from a party. And as I was coming home, I got these requests for video calls on Telegram, and it was Paul Bot. And I was very afraid to answer the video call because I thought, well, then my image and likeness might be recorded by whoever's on the other end of this. So I kept rejecting, and he tried several times, or they tried several times, rejecting, rejecting. Finally, we did an audio call, and all he said was, ‚ÄúFuck you, fuck you, fuck you‚Äù over and over again. He was so mad at me and I was‚Äî\nZo√´ Schiffer: Oh, scary.\nLauren Goode: And I just hung up the phone and blocked him, and never got the story on Paul. But yeah. Oh, and I guess the key thing is that Paul at one point told me he ran a successful trading platform. My experience was mild compared to what some people have been through. People have legitimately been scammed out of money through dating apps, and there's some part of you that says, well, you need to be a smarter consumer on these things certainly, but also there need to be guardrails in place. The companies have tried to sift through and figure out who might be as we call them, bad actors on the apps, but I think there's only so much you can do on any online platform.\nZo√´ Schiffer: And that's the thing about these types of scams that are different than other scams, pig butchery and the whole thing, is that they put a ton of effort into it. It's like why his reaction when you called them out was not entirely surprising, even though it's awful? Because it's like he's invested real time and energy into trying to ensnare you, and so then when it doesn't work, they're pissed.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, you're totally right. I think a lot of these people are also working for larger organizations. It's not to say what they're doing is OK, but a person like Paul Bot may have been reporting to someone and saying, yes, I think I've ‚Ä¶ They may have a quota essentially, and I think I've ensnared this person, and then I was trying to pig-butcher the pig butcherer.\nMichael Calore: Right. It's a terrible scam, and I think people hear enough of those stories and they want to just quit, they want to get off the apps. And also, the world opened up again, right? So all of a sudden you're hearing about these scams, you're getting upcharged for every little thing on your favorite dating app. You're on four or five dating apps and they're all trying to get you to sign up for the next tier. And finally there comes a point where you're like, ‚ÄúOK, I'm done. I'm out.\" And also, maybe people actually met somebody. We don't really know exactly what happened, but we do know that since the pandemic restrictions have eased, the use of dating apps has dropped. I'm curious about why.\nLauren Goode: I think we should also just note that I know a lot of people who also did meet their partners on dating apps and are quite happy. Statistically your chances are still pretty low, one in 10 or something like that, but I feel like... I don't know, I go to a lot of parties and people will be like, \"Oh, we met on a dating app. We're getting married, we're having a kid.\" I'm like, \"Oh, that's great.\"\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah. In terms of the decline too, it makes sense that at a certain point these apps penetrate the existing dating pool and they will maintain perhaps their user numbers if the product stays good, but they're not going to continue growing exponentially. I think in the early days, of course this was a new product and so they were picking up users at a very rapid clip. It makes sense to me that that can't continue forever and we're going to see some sort of pullback. That's not really how investment always seems to work in Silicon Valley, the expectation is that number go up forever.\nLauren Goode: Right. You only have a certain total addressable market with these apps.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Exactly.\nLauren Goode: So I do think it's a combination of things. It's the feeling that maybe in some instances they're scammy or there are bots. There's the upsell, some people don't want to upgrade and pay more because they feel like it's not worth it. There's app fatigue in general, and a lot of us are back to in real life stuff now.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. People are joining running clubs. People are going out to do anonymous tennis. People are joining polar bear swim clubs. There's all kinds of things happening in the world now that people are like, \"Oh yeah, I always heard about those things and then I really missed hanging out with people and I'm sick and tired of all of these digital relationships, so I'm going to actually going to go give those things a shot now.\"\nZo√´ Schiffer: Well, yeah. And then the upside to those things is that even if you don't meet someone, you went and did the thing. You went and did the thing, and I feel like the thing that... I mean, I think it's a both situation. Dating apps seem like they can be really helpful and then also, they don't give you the sense of what in-person chemistry is going to be like, and so meeting up with people in real life gives you that kind of instant feedback that a dating app just can never do.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, and I just think in general, we as humans tend to be pretty bad at saying, this is a thing that I think I want, and it's actually misaligned with what we want.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, which means the algorithms are... To me, it reminds me of the Spotify thing, where the Spotify algorithm can feed you music based on your past listening experience, but it can't surprise you in the way that randomly hearing a song that you didn't know you'd like but really speaks to you in that moment can. I feel like, yes, dating apps can help predict who we might find attractive on the page, but we have all, I feel like, had the experience of meeting someone and being totally surprised by an in-person attraction that you might've completely glossed over on a screen.\nMichael Calore: So folks are more interested in going out and meeting each other in real life, and they're not hanging out online as much, and there are more apps, there more choices to go out and find your unique smaller community where you can find romance. And it's not a direct correlation between those things happening and the rise of scams and the drop-off of usage in dating apps, but there are some pretty stark numbers that we can look at to show that, oh, people actually are not spending as much time on the apps and they're not spending as much money on the apps.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah. I mean, Match Group reported a 3% decline in paying users in the third quarter of 2024, and just to share one other stat, shares of Bumble plunged nearly 30% after the company dramatically lowered its annual revenue outlook. It's not comprehensive, but I feel like those just give a sense of where the market is at right now.\nLauren Goode: And both Bumble and Match Group have gone through pretty significant executive changes in the past couple of years.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, founders stepping down.\nMichael Calore: Maybe they will find true love in the marketplace place. All right, well that brings us up to the current moment. So let's take another break and when we come back we'll talk about where it's all going. So for all of the folks out there who are still on the apps and meeting people, and interacting with all of these new AI features, what is the experience like? What is dating like now in 2025 on the apps?\nLauren Goode: It's that sigh. If I were to give a broad picture of where I think the apps end up, I think it's that people continue to lean in on trying to meet in person still, through friends, at events, through shared hobbies and that the apps are just basically lead generators. They're like other apps we leave on our phones or maybe we don't take super seriously, but we check from time to time. And in some instances they may lead to a date, but I think in general, expectations are kind of low. And that of course is my own perspective and it's maybe personalizing it a little bit, but I think all of these ideas of we're going to be dating in VR and it's all going to happen through the apps, I don't think that's where it's at.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Yeah, I feel like my friends and siblings that are using these successfully, say the move is start a conversation and as quickly as possible meet up. The goal is not to keep talking on the app. And if it takes more than a week, then that's just... You're going to drop it.\nMichael Calore: I have weirdly high hopes for the AI features, because we talked a little bit about some of the apps experimenting with what Grindr is calling the AI wing man, but basically like a bot that helps you flirt or a chatbot that you can send to the other person's chatbot to talk through some of the small talk stuff to see if you're actually compatible. But then there are more sort of interesting uses for AI within the apps. There are basically profile concierges that will look at your profile and maybe suggest different types of photos, tell you to remove a certain photo because it's too much like another kind of photo, remind you to include a full body pic or something with better lighting. And then there are also AI bots that will read your profile and give you suggestions about things you can do to improve it. For example, instead of putting out negative boundaries, you put out positive boundaries. So instead of saying, I don't want to meet for coffee at your house, you can say something like, \"Let's meet up for a drink to see if we're compatible.\" Just changing the language in your profile. So those sort of helpful things just make people better on the apps and may lead to more connections for them. Of course, this is all being done in the face of the massive gamification and all of the upselling as well because the companies have not backed off on those yet.\nZo√´ Schiffer: But I think that that's a really good point, Mike. That actually makes me think that I should recalibrate what I said about the Grindr AI wing man because when I've tried to help friends write their profiles, there's no more difficult form of writing than trying to distill someone's essence into a few lines on a dating app. So having an AI that kind of has a really good viewpoint from gobbling up tons and tons of data on what's worked in other people's profiles and what hasn't, that could be super helpful for people.\nLauren Goode: I also think if there is a bright spot, it's probably going to be some of the apps that are very specific for people that help people winnow down what they're looking for and find someone who is aligned with what they want, whether that's someone who shares super niche interests or cultural values or even disabilities, people who just are like, \"I need to find someone who actually understands this.\" I think that there are a lot of positives in dating apps for that.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Another place that AI is making some interesting enhancements to the app experience is through the matchmaking, basically giving you a smaller subset of people that it thinks you'll be best matched for. Instead of just showing you the old algorithm, there's this new algorithm that gives you a better selection, and that's kind of interesting. So yeah, I don't think these things are going to stop people from using the apps, and I don't think they're going to necessarily make any of the other problems of the apps go away, but they could lead to more meaningful connections happening more quickly for people.\nLauren Goode: We're going to leave this on a positive note, right guys? We're going to give all the people looking for love, something to hope for.\nMichael Calore: Embrace.\nLauren Goode: We're like, \"Look, no one's using the apps anymore. Revenues are down, executive shakeups, scams, spam, bots, but keep looking.\"\nMichael Calore: Buy the ticket, take the ride. Embrace the AI matchmaker and the AI chatbot. Let it do all of the work for you. All right, so to close us out, let's pretend that we're going back out into IRL dating and we're going out to meet somebody. What is the ideal place to meet somebody?\nZo√´ Schiffer: I mean, I met my husband at a book club and I thought that was a pretty good place.\nLauren Goode: That's pretty good. Gosh, I don't know. I'd probably say a friend's party or something like that. Or maybe something like a piano bar, and then you have to figure out if the person is there because they are being ironic or they're really into piano.\nMichael Calore: And probably both of those would be good, right?\nLauren Goode: Sure. Yeah.\nMichael Calore: You kind of want the person who's genuinely there earnestly, and you kind of want the person who's there, ironically.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: I would say probably the best place to meet somebody is on a bike ride.\nLauren Goode: It's hard to have the conversation.\nMichael Calore: There are group rides though.\nZo√´ Schiffer: Oh, right. And there's always coffee and pastry afterwards.\nMichael Calore: There's always coffee and pastry afterwards.\nZo√´ Schiffer: That's a good one.\nLauren Goode: I like that.\nMichael Calore: Nobody said Instagram.\nLauren Goode: No. No one did.\nMichael Calore: Slide into those DMs folks, it's Valentine's Day.\nLauren Goode: Seems like a good place to end it.\nMichael Calore: Thanks for listening to Uncanny Valley.

I'm WIRED's global editorial director, Katie Drummond. We are just four weeks, four weeks, into the Trump administration here in the United States, but there has been so much news, some of which we've been breaking here at WIRED, so we wanted to get into that a little bit today on Uncanny Valley. I'm joined by senior editor Leah Feiger, who runs our politics coverage. Hi, Leah.\nLeah Feiger: Hey, Katie. Thanks for having me.\nKatie Drummond: Pretty special couple of weeks.\nLeah Feiger: Oh, it's been a fun one. Just so great.\nKatie Drummond: The team has been working relentlessly, very, very hard. I can personally attest to seeing some very late-night messages circulating among our staff.\nLeah Feiger: Yeah, sorry about that.\nKatie Drummond: No problem. All of the snacks that I had in my office have been eaten. I had to go buy more. That should give you a bit of a sense of what's been happening at WIRED. Leah, so much of our coverage has really centered on DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by, of course, Elon Musk, with the endorsement of President Trump. Catch us up just for starters on this week at DOGE. What's the latest? Because there's so much happening, it's really hard to keep up and keep track.\nLeah Feiger: There's a ton happening right now. Honestly, the last two weeks have felt like two years, just in terms of the news cycle. In the last 48 hours alone, President Trump put out his executive order to make pretty clear that DOGE continues to have his full support and would be able to continue commencing with large-scale workforce cuts across the board. Late last night, Makena Kelly, our senior politics reporter, reported that dozens of workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB, were fired in an after-hours blitz. These things are happening really, really fast. Those employees, for example, the CFPB, they were notified with an email that addressed them as parentheses, employee first name dot employee last name, job title, division. This is not personal. This is just cutting, cutting, cutting.\nKatie Drummond: This is slash and burn.\nLeah Feiger: Yeah.\nKatie Drummond: This is straight out of the Musk playbook that we've seen at other companies.\nLeah Feiger: A hundred percent.\nKatie Drummond: Twitter being a prime and very recent example. That also brings to mind, to me, one of the stories that we just published, that Makena just published this morning, which was looking at sort of who is being installed in senior-level roles across these agencies that might actually give Musk and DOGE more power than they already have. Can you talk a little bit about that?\nLeah Feiger: Absolutely. She found that former Palantir and Elon Musk associates are taking over key government IT roles. These are called chief information officers. If you haven't heard of them before, that's totally fine, but just know that they're incredibly important. They manage an agency's information technology, oversee sensitive databases, including classified ones. These are really important people that now have folks aligned with Musk or with Palantir, which as we know is tied to Peter Thiel, another Musk ally.\nKatie Drummond: Right. The concern among experts that Makena spoke to is that if individuals in these CIO roles are aligned with Musk, aligned with the efforts of DOGE, that that could actually make it easier for DOGE workers to gain access to really sensitive material, sensitive information.\nLeah Feiger: Sensitive systems.\nKatie Drummond: Now, let's back up a little bit, because we're talking about what DOGE is doing in the last 24 hours. It sort of feels like there are several news cycles happening around DOGE every 24 hours. We just sort of gave you the last day or so, but let's back way up and talk about DOGE, how it was created, and what we discovered earlier on in our reporting about this organization, about this group. Sort of who are these people and how did they end up in all of these federal agencies?\nLeah Feiger: Absolutely, and you're going to have to help me fill in on all of these stories too.\nKatie Drummond: I would be happy to.\nLeah Feiger: Because you have been in the thick of it with us, but this Department of Government Efficiency, we are constantly putting the word so-called right in front of it with all of our reporting, because this isn't an actual department. That requires Congress. That requires a whole lot more than Trump or Musk going out and declaring on X that they now have a department. However, this so-called department is now within the Executive Office of the President. They were quite shrewd with its creation. They actually took over the USDS, the US Digital Service, which has led to some very interesting aftershocks here. Makena also reported last week that there has now been a firewall barrier between legacy USDS employees and new DOGE employees. When WIRED first started reporting on this, I think one of the reasons that we've really managed to be on top of this story is that we were able to see the forest amongst the trees, that we had to take them seriously and had to figure out where they would be going first and what that would look like.\nKatie Drummond: I think it's important to mention here, too, that last year when DOGE first sort of surfaced or was announced by candidate Trump, now President Trump, and Musk, the idea that was conveyed to the public was that this would be sort of an external consultancy, right?\nLeah Feiger: Right.\nKatie Drummond: That Musk and DOGE, whomever made up that group, would be consulting with Trump and with the federal government around potential cuts, potential changes.\nLeah Feiger: Right.\nKatie Drummond: What we're talking about now is essentially a co-opting, if I may use that term, of an existing agency, sidelining its employees in order to sort of run DOGE under somewhat official pretenses\nLeah Feiger: And then taking on more power than that original agency ever had.\nKatie Drummond: Exactly.\nLeah Feiger: But using that agency's access to other agencies.\nKatie Drummond: Now, we've learned a lot, and WIRED has broken a lot of this news, but so have other news organizations, about who actually is a participant in DOGE. Who are these people? Initially, about a week and a half ago, Tori Elliott, one of our fabulous politics reporters, another really dogged WIRED journalist, broke a story identifying six of these individuals. They are young men aged sort of 19 to 24. We named them. We shared any details we were able to glean about their backgrounds and about what they are doing inside of DOGE and across federal agencies. A few things really stood out to me from that reporting. One was that none of these young men have really any government experience at all.\nLeah Feiger: Oh God, no. No.\nKatie Drummond: The second being that all of them are somehow tied to either Elon Musk or Peter Thiel, who is of course a key Musk ally.\nLeah Feiger: These very young men have found themselves with the keys to so many different government agencies right now. We have tracked them through their work at USAID, at the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, at the General Services Administration, and TTS within that. They are all over the place right now, the Department of Education. There are also a lot of grown-ups in the room, too. Don't want to forget those. At the General Services Administration, we have Nicole Hollander, a former Twitter staffer, married to Steve Davis, who's very, very involved in DOGE everything right now. The two of them actually slept at the Twitter offices during Musk's takeover a couple of years ago. These are people who aren't just affiliated but have intimate knowledge as to how Musk operates.\nKatie Drummond: Right.\nLeah Feiger: And how he could possibly continue planning to make these cuts and get DOGE everywhere he wants it to be.\nKatie Drummond: Not that I can sort of expect that you would be inside the psyche of one of these young men who raised a hand to participate in DOGE, but what do we know about how these people were recruited? What would be the incentive for them? What would inspire someone to raise a hand and say, \"Yes, I want to slash and burn my way through the federal government\"?\nLeah Feiger: Yeah, absolutely. Vittoria Elliott and Tim Marchman our director of politics, security, and science, reported over the weekend about all of this recruitment, and how some of this recruitment actually went down, which included Discord chats and alumni groups for Palantir interns and the like. It's really well planned. These were people that already bought in, at least to a certain extent.\nKatie Drummond: Sure.\nLeah Feiger: And are finding themselves with the keys to the kingdom. Getting into the psyche is obviously so hard here, but I think something that I just want to make so, so clear is the US is so incredibly divided right now. Even if you're not consuming news or on social platforms that are celebrating Musk, perhaps you're talking to your friends right now who are all like, ‚ÄúI can't believe he's doing this.‚Äù There are so many people out there obsessed with what's happening, obsessed with him, lionize him. He is an idol to so many.\nKatie Drummond: Right, right. Particularly you would imagine young men of a certain background and a certain sort of professional set.\nLeah Feiger: Absolutely.\nKatie Drummond: Technologists, people who work in the Valley. I think one thing that stood out to me too from that story about the recruiting tactics is, in some instances these were former interns or former employees at companies like Palantir dipping back into their networks to ask people to raise a hand. This isn't exactly Elon Musk going out and hand-selecting the best and brightest from his companies.\nLeah Feiger: No.\nKatie Drummond: This is sort of a spray-and-pray approach across several online communities where alumni of a handful of companies tend to congregate and tend to spend time.\nLeah Feiger: That's already led to a lot of controversy for them. Is this the moment where I say ‚Äúbig balls‚Äù in front of my boss on a podcast?\nKatie Drummond: Let's say ‚Äúbig balls,‚Äù Leah. Tell us a little bit. This is one particular individual, Edward Coristine, who has attracted I think more scrutiny than many of his peers within DOGE because his background is colorful, to say the least.\nLeah Feiger: His background is so colorful. This is a 19-year-old DOGE staffer who experts have told WIRED would probably not have passed a background check, typically required of all these sensitive US government systems that he now has access to. This staffer, Edward Coristine, goes by Big Balls online. He also owned Tesla.sexy LLC and worked at a startup that hired convicted hackers. Again, he's 19, so he's been busy. I was not doing nearly this much at age 19. That's who's in our government right now. Also, another one I just want to throw in that's drawn up a lot of controversy that WIRED also identified, Marko Elez.\nKatie Drummond: Marko.\nLeah Feiger: We got to talk about Marko. We figured out that Marko Elez, as part of DOGE, was given read and write access to really sensitive Treasury payment systems. After our reporting, The Wall Street Journal was able to confirm that Elez had actually ended up resigning, according to the White House, due to a flurry of racist social media posts that were discovered that he had links to. We're talking about the Big Balls controversy. We're talking about Elez. It's not that these people are getting found out and then running and hiding away. To a certain extent, right? Elez resigned, but as Elez resigns, and as that reporting comes out, Elon Musk, JD Vance, people from a lot of different corners of the Republican GOP spectrum, are all going online and attaching their names to this, which is so wild, calling for these people to be brought back, saying that these mistakes of childhood shouldn't be impactful. These mistakes were made several months ago. I am not sure what our timeline is here for this.\nKatie Drummond: Speaking of these young men and their online defenders, WIRED published that story naming six of them and sharing what we had learned about the access that they had and their backgrounds. Now, Leah, we got a lot of flack for that. We were not without criticism over that decision, which ultimately I own. It is a decision that we stand behind, but we're going to take a quick break and then let's talk about that.\n[break]\nKatie Drummond: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Katie Drummond, WIRED's global editorial director, and we are here talking about the latest with DOGE. Now, Leah, let's get back to that decision we made, that WIRED made, to name six of these young men working at Musk's behest for DOGE within the federal government. What informed that decision to actually name names in the story?\nLeah Feiger: It's a decision that we didn't take lightly. These are young people who have been working for DOGE for a limited period of time, who have been in Elon Musk's orbit by virtue of their age for a limited period of time. Ultimately, it's actually a really simple answer, and that's that they're working in the government right now, and government employees need to be public to the American people.\nKatie Drummond: I could not agree more. It's a simple answer and it's a clear answer, and absolutely it was not a decision that we made lightly. We've been making a lot of decisions, not just going back the last few weeks, but actually the last many, many months. I remember in July of 2024 Donald Trump was shot in the ear. Obviously a massive story, a massive news event, and photos were released of him raising his fist.\nLeah Feiger: Saying, ‚ÄúFight, fight, fight.‚Äù\nKatie Drummond: ‚ÄúFight, fight.‚Äù A really iconic moment. I remember sitting there and thinking, ‚ÄúOK, he is going to win this election. He is going to be the president.‚Äù\nLeah Feiger: Oh, yeah.\nKatie Drummond: Obviously a lot transpired after that with Kamala Harris entering the race, and so on and so forth, but that really felt like a transformational moment for our newsroom in how we were thinking about the election. I remember talking to the newsroom the Monday after that happened, it was over a weekend, and saying, \"We need to start getting ready for what this looks like for us across everything that we cover.\" Tell us about how you and your team and the newsroom from that moment on started to get ready to cover this moment that we are now in.\nLeah Feiger: Well, to give you a little bit more credit first, I have a distinct memory, and not to reveal any private conversations, but I have a distinct memory after that weekend of talking with you and some of the other folks on the team. We were talking about the fact that Elon Musk had endorsed Trump and that was ... he'd been gearing up to that for many months, but this was his first big one. This was official. You said, \"It's different now,\" and you were right. We have continued to cover it through that lens. The addition of Musk to all of this was not like anything that anyone could have predicted. Our strategy ended up having to cover Musk fully almost as this political entity.\nKatie Drummond: Right.\nLeah Feiger: With his relationship to Trump, but also his relationship to the campaign. I remember we broke a lot of news in the lead-up to the campaign about Elon Musk's America Pack and the really ridiculous things happening there, where he was outsourcing to campaign staffers who ended up getting shoved into U-Haul vans and driven around and given insane quotas and not paid. There was mess from the beginning, and his hands were in all of it.\nKatie Drummond: And his money too.\nLeah Feiger: And his money too.\nKatie Drummond: To the tune of I think $278 million in campaign contributions.\nLeah Feiger: And he's recouped all of that, and then some.\nKatie Drummond: Absolutely. This has been very good for Musk-owned entities.\nLeah Feiger: Very, very good. When we're thinking about how our coverage changed and became informed, it was taking him very seriously. I think that the mistake that ... How many journalists have relitigated the mistake of covering Trump from his first term in office, which was taking everything he said at face value.\nKatie Drummond: Right.\nLeah Feiger: I'm going to deport every single person that I do not like, whatever. No, there's parts of that that are true and parts of that are not. Figuring out what that looked like. Musk entering this changed the entire game. Everything that he's saying and everything that he's talking about, we're taking incredibly seriously. Not literally, but seriously.\nKatie Drummond: I think too what's so interesting or sort of important for WIRED is that we have a lot of background on Musk, right? We understand how he operates within the companies that he owns. We have a director on staff, Zo√´ Schiffer, actually one of the hosts of Uncanny Valley, wrote the book Extremely Hardcore, a fantastic book about‚Äî\nLeah Feiger: Everyone go read it.\nKatie Drummond: Everyone go read Extremely Hardcore. It's such a good book. She really told the definitive story of that takeover.\nLeah Feiger: Absolutely.\nKatie Drummond: We have this understanding of that playbook, right? His startup playbook, his Silicon Valley playbook, how he goes into companies and reshapes them in very, very drastic and often chaotic and legally dubious ways that we are now seeing play out in the government. I think that that insight and that background, to your point, allowed us to take him seriously and allowed us to contextualize a lot of this chaos that we are now seeing within the government.\nLeah Feiger: Right. Something that I always think about from Trump's first term is that it would be like, OK, we want to do X, Y, and Z, but it was very clear that they had no idea how to accomplish that. There is a clear difference this time around. Musk went into USDS and then immediately went after the General Services Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, basically the government's HR, and these key agencies that had access to other agencies and had access to just a ton of data and classified information and building records. Just so many things that are really core to how the US government ticks. Figuring out where to even enter the colossus that is the federal system, he figured that out.\nKatie Drummond: Right. There was a plan, there was a playbook.\nLeah Feiger: There was a plan. There was absolutely a plan. Being able to balance the chaos and planned chaos with also a very clear understanding of where to make the most impact. The treasury is such a good example of that. We're in this holding pattern right now. After our reporting that DOGE had read and write access, 18 attorneys general from around the country sued the Trump administration. There's now a temporary hold from a federal judge until Friday to say that not only can DOGE not have this access, they have to destroy anything they've taken out of these sensitive Treasury payment systems. Musk meanwhile is tweeting away and saying, \"We should have access. This is ridiculous. Why are you taking this from us? This is a breach of federal jurisdiction.\" Vance is getting in on it, too. Causing this chaos, causing this new cycle, but also knowing exactly what to target and exactly what will get him where he wants to go, it's wild to watch.\nKatie Drummond: It is wild. While all of that chaos plays out in front of the American people and sort of obfuscates and puts up some smoke around what's going on, I think what's important to know from WIRED is that we are really committed to just answering some very simple questions. I think that's what we set out to do with this DOGE reporting in the first place. It's what is this organization? What is it designed to do? Who works for it? What exactly are they doing inside of these agencies? That's all we're trying to figure out.\nLeah Feiger: Exactly.\nKatie Drummond: Those are the questions that our journalists have been trying to answer for the last several weeks and will continue trying to answer as we push forward with this reporting. We're going to take a short break and we'll be back in a minute.\n[break]\nKatie Drummond: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm WIRED's global editorial director, Katie Drummond. I'm here with Leah Feiger, our politics editor, and we are talking all things DOGE and federal government.\nNow, Leah, we talked right before we jumped into the studio. You are working on yet another scoop, and you have a look of panic in your eyes, so we do need to get moving soon. Before we leave the studio and you rush back to your desk, tell me what you and your team are keeping an eye on now. As you look ahead, I mean, it's hard to look past the next few days, but as you look to the next few days, and maybe the next few weeks, what stands out to you? What should people be paying attention to?\nLeah Feiger: A lot of people have been writing this over the last two days, and to echo so many who are much smarter than me, we're gearing up to a constitutional crisis right now. Musk, Vance, a number of people from the GOP, Trump administration have made it very clear that they're not actually that interested in abiding by these court orders, or even temporary court holds that we have, for example, right now with DOGE's access to the Treasury. What happens next? We're keeping a very close eye. As these court orders continue to come down, will DOGE's team be abiding by them? Is it just a lot of bluster saying, \"Oh, we don't think that you should be able to exercise this power over us.\" Are they actually abiding by them? If they don't abide by them, what happens next? This whole country is built on checks and balances, and not to go entirely Schoolhouse Rock, but we're about to enter some uncharted territory.\nKatie Drummond: It is very surreal. I remember just in the last few weeks talking to people about it's chaos, DOGE is doing all of these different things in all of these agencies. What's going to happen? My answer was they're moving very quickly. The courts move more slowly, but the courts will catch up to this. There are lawsuits being filed. There are individuals petitioning the courts for temporary‚Äî\nLeah Feiger: And so many have been. Absolutely.\nKatie Drummond: So many have been, so my answer has been, this will go through court and it will churn through the legal system, and it will be slow and messy and painful, but that is what the legal system is here to protect and is here to safeguard is our democracy and these checks and balances. This is sort of the last stand, right?\nLeah Feiger: Absolutely.\nKatie Drummond: The courts are the last stand in terms of our democracy and constitutional integrity. What we are now looking at is the possibility that that may not hold. What would that even begin to look like if that came to pass? I know that you're not a legal expert in addition to being WIRED's politics editor, but what have you heard? What have experts told you in the course of your reporting?\nLeah Feiger: There's a lot of people that are saying, \"Look, these holds are going to come through. Musk and Trump are going to be appealing them, and then eventually this is going to end in the Supreme Court.\" A lot of people are actually taking solace with this. They're saying, \"Yes, the court may be leaning quite Republican ideologically, but these are trained professionals who will understand that these legal systems must be upheld and adhered to.\" I'm not as confident in that.\nKatie Drummond: Right.\nLeah Feiger: I'll be totally honest. In terms of what happens next, I think that because of, in some ways, the slow march of these court systems, although decisions, even temporary ones, have been coming down really fast, there's a lot of room to move fast and break things from DOGE's side meanwhile.\nKatie Drummond: Yeah.\nLeah Feiger: A lot of these eggs can't get unscrambled. A lot of these layoffs and firings and foreclosures are ... It's going to be really hard to walk those back once a court is able to finally say, \"No, no, no, this just can't hold.\" And that's‚Äî\nKatie Drummond: If they can say that at all.\nLeah Feiger: If they can say that at all.\nKatie Drummond: Right.\nLeah Feiger: We're hearing that concern from experts all across the board right now. We've never seen anything like this.\nKatie Drummond: We certainly haven't. Not here in the United States. No.\nLeah Feiger: Not here in the United States.\nKatie Drummond: Well, in the meantime, we hold our breath.

    "content_text": "The thing about the takeover of key US government institutions by the world‚Äôs richest man and his strike force of former interns is that it‚Äôs happening so fast.\nIt‚Äôs been three weeks since Elon Musk‚Äôs agents took over the government‚Äôs IT and HR departments. Since then, the movements of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency have had the cartography of a horror movie, DOGE picking off agencies one by one based on slasher logic, feeding an unslakeable thirst for cost-cutting and data.\nEvery day brings fresh incursions. Three weeks ago the United States believed in humanitarian aid. It helped people who had been ripped off by big corporations. It funded the infrastructure necessary to make America a beacon of scientific innovation. Now the United States Agency for International Development is gutted, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is on ice, and National Institutes of Health grants are handcuffed. So much for all that.\nThese are spreadsheet cruelties, executed with a click. The loss of real peoples‚Äô jobs and lives‚Äîyes, despite what X-famous conspiracy theorists will tell you, USAID saved lives‚Äîall immaterial compared to the pursuit of a tighter balance sheet.\nThree weeks ago, a 19-year-old who calls himself ‚ÄúBig Balls‚Äù online didn‚Äôt have access to government personnel records and more. A 25-year-old with a closet full of racist tweets hadn‚Äôt gotten the keys to Treasury systems that pay out $5.45 trillion each year. Elon Musk hadn‚Äôt turned the Oval Office into a romper room for his 4-year-old son.\nThe speed is strategy, of course, flooding the zone so that neither the media nor the courts can keep pace. Lawsuits and court orders move on a different timescale than this slash-and-burn approach. (At this pace, DOGE will have tapped into every last government server long before the Supreme Court even has a chance to weigh in.) But it‚Äôs also reflexive. The first order of business in a corporate takeover is to slash costs as quickly as possible. If you can‚Äôt fire people, offer them buyouts. If they won‚Äôt take the buyouts, find a way to fire them anyway. Keep cutting until you hit bone.\nThis is how you get an executive order declaring that ‚Äúeach agency hire no more than one employee for every four employees that depart,‚Äù an arbitrary ratio with no regard for actual staffing needs. It‚Äôs how you get hundreds of federal government buildings on the auction block no matter how fully occupied they are. It‚Äôs both extreme and ill-considered, a race to empty the town‚Äôs only well.\nAnd then ‚Ä¶ what? This is the question that Elon Musk and DOGE have failed to answer, because there is no answer. Does the United States government need to become a profit engine? To return shareholder value? Does Medicaid need to demonstrate a product-market fit in time for the next funding round?\nThis is consultant logic. This is an engineering sprint whose inevitable finish line is the unwinding of the social contract. Democracy doesn‚Äôt die in darkness after all; it dies in JIRA tickets filed by Palantir alums.\nIt‚Äôs somehow even worse than that, though. Suppose you take this whole enterprise at face value, that the United States should go through the private equity ringer. It does not take a Stanford MBA to know that cutting expenses only helps half of your profit and loss statement. Any serious attempt to treat the US like a business would involve increasing revenues. So where are the taxes? And why demolish the CFPB, which has paid out over $20 billion to US citizens‚Äîshareholders, if you will‚Äîthrough its enforcement actions?\nIn the coming weeks and months, as this farce continues to unfurl, remember that the goal of most acquisitions is not to benefit the acquired. It is to either subsume or discard, whichever generates the highest return.\nElon Musk‚Äôs unprecedented influence over the executive branch will ultimately benefit Elon Musk. The employees in charge are his employees. The data DOGE collects, the procurement contracts they oversee, it all flows up to him.\nAnd it‚Äôs flowing too quickly to keep up with, much less to stop.\nThe Chatroom\nDo you think Elon Musk will be able to avoid conflicts of interest in his DOGE role?\nLeave a comment on the site or send your thoughts to mail@wired.com.\nWIRED Reads\n- The GSA Plans to Sell Hundreds of Its Federal Government Buildings: The General Services Administration, staffed at its upper levels by Elon Musk associates, plans to sell 500-plus buildings‚Äîsome of which house government agencies and the offices of US senators.\n- DOGE Has Started Gutting a Key US Technology Agency: At least dozens of workers at the Technology Transformation Service were fired on Wednesday, a day after similar sudden cuts at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n- Former Palantir and Elon Musk Associates Are Taking Over Government IT Roles: The chief information officers of at least three major government agencies have been replaced by Silicon Valley executives, including from Palantir and Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX.\nWant more?

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nthe WIRED Gear team loves to obsess over AirPods cases. Not just any old cases‚Äîwe're talking about ones that look like sneakers, candy, luggage, cell phones, or even tins of Spam. Yes, I really do love Spam so much that I'd carry a can on my person at all times. Are these cases as charming, durable, and protective in person as they appear online? To find out, we tested several across Apple's lineup of wireless headphones. These are our favorite eccentric cases for the AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max. If eccentric isn't your thing, we have some traditional options too.\nCheck out our many other buying guides, including the Best AirPods, Best iPhone 16 Cases, Best iPad Accessories, Best Wireless Earbuds, and Best MacBook Accessories.\nUpdated February 2025: We've added the Bandolier Avery AirPods Clip-On Pouch and the ESR Orbit Hybrid case.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nWhich AirPods Do You Have?\nHow do you know which case to buy? Apple has several generations of its AirPods, whether you have the standard AirPods or the AirPods Pro, so be sure the case you select works with your model. (Some cases are interchangeable, particularly the first- and second-generation AirPods and the first- and second-generation AirPods Pro.) To find what you have, head to Settings > Bluetooth on the Apple device you've paired it with. Tap on the ‚Äúi‚Äù icon next to your AirPods' name and you'll see a model number. If your AirPods aren't connected to an Apple device, you can find the model number on the device itself. It's on the underside of each earbud‚Äîyou might need to use the magnify feature on your smartphone to view it.\nOnce you have a model number, you can cross-reference it with this guide to figure out the generation, or check the list below:\n- AirPods (4th Generation, ANC, 2024): A3056, A3055, A3057\n- AirPods (4th Generation, 2024): A3053, A3050, A3054\n- AirPods Max (USB-C, 2024): A3184\n- AirPods Pro (2nd Generation, 2022): A2931, A2699, A2698\n- AirPods Max (Lightning, 2020): A2096\n- AirPods Pro (1st Generation, 2019): A2084, A2083\n- AirPods (3rd Generation, 2021): A2565, A2564\n- AirPods (2nd Generation, 2019): A2032, A2031\n- AirPods (1st Generation, 2017): A1523, A1722\nYou probably know if you bought a different case for your AirPods, but it's worth checking the case's model number too, as Apple has released stand-alone models with wireless charging and MagSafe support. You can find those details here.\nHow We Test AirPods Cases\nAlthough multiple people are testing different cases for this guide, we evaluate them all similarly. For starters, we grade how well it works with built-in AirPods features. We consider it a great cover if it doesn't get in the way of certain capabilities like wireless charging, seeing the LED indicator clearly (to see the battery level and charging status at a glance), and the ability to hear the Find My tone when looking for your AirPods case (some cases cover the speakers). For the AirPods Max, we also check that you can easily access all the controls on both earcups.\nMost important, we judge these based on how well the covers protect our AirPods on a daily basis‚Äîwhether on our desks or in our pockets and purses. We also grade how well they protect our AirPods cases from falls, specifically checking whether the cover is snug enough that it doesn't fall off when it hits the ground and if the case itself remains unscathed. For the most part, we test each case for about a month (if not more), to make sure they remain durable over time.\nOther Cases We‚Äôve Tested and Like\nNot all cases we tested are winners, but we still like 'em enough to recommend them if you enjoy the style. We'll continue testing more AirPods cases as we get them.\nNomad Leather AirPods Case for $40: Nomad also makes great leather cases for all AirPods generations, and they rival our top pick in quality. In fact, you can go with the same Ecco leather that Mujjo uses or pay up for Horween leather, which feels a bit more luxe and comes from an esteemed tannery in Chicago. They fit well, have a cutout for the LED on the front, and support wireless chargers.\nCrochet Cat Airpods Case for $39: This crocheted cat case is the cutest thing ever, with a little fish bag looped around the shoulder and a bell on the collar. I like that the top and bottom pieces are connected, instead of being two separate pieces. However, the AirPods don't fit snugly‚Äîthere's a bit of space at the bottom. The exact case and seller we got this from appear to no longer be active on Etsy, but we've linked to another one that looks identical. Compatible with AirPods (1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation) and AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd generation) ‚ÄîMedea Giordano\nBluebonnet Leather AirPods Case for $40: If you're after a leather case, I prefer Mujjo or Nomad's cases above. Bluebonnet's case is a single piece, and while it's made of top-grain leather, it doesn't feel all that exquisite. There's a cutout for the LED light, and wireless charging works perfectly. The pictures on Bluebonnet's site feel a little deceptive, though‚Äîwhen the case is open, a part of it lifts up out of the bottom section of the case, which doesn't look right, and Bluebonnet doesn't show this on its product page. Compatible with AirPods (1st, 2nd, and 4th generation) and AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd generation)\nCute Dinosaur AirPods Case for $14: This case isn't just super cute, it does a great job of protecting the AirPods case. Given its shape, it's bulkier than a lot of other AirPods cases, but that comes with the territory of choosing a dinosaur shape. Unfortunately, I noticed it stains easily over time (likely from being exposed to debris or dust). Compatible with AirPods (3rd Generation)\nMindresy Silicone Case Cover for AirPods Max for $14: If you're hesitant about whether or not you want covers for your AirPods Max, these are a solid, affordable option to start with. My favorite thing about this set is that, in addition to the earcup covers, you also get covers for the earpad and headband. I have two gripes though‚Äîthe cutouts aren't exact, but still accessible, and the silicone attracts tiny dust particles that can be frustrating to pick off. The additional pieces make for a tighter fit of the headphones on your head, which is ideal for me because the AirPods Max tend to slide off my head. Compatible with AirPods Max\nAvoid These Cases\nJiunai Pop-It AirPods 2 Case for $7: My hands are in constant need of fidgeting, so naturally, I love a fidget toy to keep me occupied. I was excited to try this case, hoping it would give my hands something to do other than open and close my AirPods 300 times in a row. Despite the positive Amazon reviews, it wasn‚Äôt fun or satisfying to push the bubbles. The top part doesn‚Äôt even stay on. ‚ÄîMedea Giordano\nOlytop Floral Shell AirPods Pro Case for $12: I've been using this case with my second-generation AirPods Pro. It's clear, which makes it easy to see the LED light at all times, and the sparkly, floral print adds a fun touch. Instead of a carabiner clip, it comes with a cute, pearl-beaded lanyard.

In fact, you can go with the same Ecco leather that Mujjo uses or pay up for Horween leather, which feels a bit more luxe and comes from an esteemed tannery in Chicago. They fit well, have a cutout for the LED on the front, and support wireless chargers.</p><p><strong><a class=\"external-link\" data-aps-asc-tag=\"w050b-20\" data-aps-asin=\"1612169129\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/4NeJabgQykde13qrmPRuhidu9SxXHSLRy4sba59DzJ8w8H9SMXbinJgihfR2RN8oNkgQzdKqb11icY6v6KCPX1mvM5PKHDPQBj9WWz15kuusuF4X3U8E1S51gbrDEx9c8VnDTTtJkTsUmrgH81LNjgenZEvVHfVL1SpjhRYUqjA9EPjcSGZg86pUAuwmDCMFjddYf7Km4WfTdMYejH5UoUfADYD2gQVbwbnftCfvnnbNsXUCCux2GaCrirU4wbN6BP7qya2VDmf7mLFg32Yv5bqK5s2Y3Lh9HoZmmsh1Dx4BcPGBKxmuTUhzycYcFZHd7peB5S1e3TpyStaY3uXGT24oJveotXyvoL\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/1612169129/crochet-cat-airpods-case-knitted-apple\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/4NeJabgQykde13qrmPRuhidu9SxXHSLRy4sba59DzJ8w8H9SMXbinJgihfR2RN8oNkgQzdKqb11icY6v6KCPX1mvM5PKHDPQBj9WWz15kuusuF4X3U8E1S51gbrDEx9c8VnDTTtJkTsUmrgH81LNjgenZEvVHfVL1SpjhRYUqjA9EPjcSGZg86pUAuwmDCMFjddYf7Km4WfTdMYejH5UoUfADYD2gQVbwbnftCfvnnbNsXUCCux2GaCrirU4wbN6BP7qya2VDmf7mLFg32Yv5bqK5s2Y3Lh9HoZmmsh1Dx4BcPGBKxmuTUhzycYcFZHd7peB5S1e3TpyStaY3uXGT24oJveotXyvoL\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Crochet Cat Airpods Case for $39</a>:</strong> This crocheted cat case is the cutest thing ever, with a little fish bag looped around the shoulder and a bell on the collar.

Bluebonnet's case is a single piece, and while it's made of top-grain leather, it doesn't feel all that exquisite. There's a cutout for the LED light, and wireless charging works perfectly. The pictures on Bluebonnet's site feel a little deceptive, though‚Äîwhen the case is open, a part of it lifts up out of the bottom section of the case, which doesn't look right, and Bluebonnet doesn't show this on its product page. <em>Compatible with AirPods (1st, 2nd, and 4th generation) and AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd generation)</em></p><ad position=\"mid-content\"></ad><p><strong><a class=\"external-link\" data-aps-asc-tag=\"w050b-20\" data-aps-asin=\"B0BKYDDJV1\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/RADNkTB2Qu41rYRMhgSNCmEW4KYM4tyPaAFBhMbE3G7MrWYRb5EJNmRxXMcs3izjZtFHtW4e6DfNu3Jd6LsMpwmyjkYRVqyEGjx8WrupizCV6d1rHE2FL4Sus67z4N84yiCdPFgH3aY7wvnbG2UU75CjD9cZqSMgg7UvL9qCLfrXQf3aoWj2AvYeXdonV4jPBzkuUNvFaE74mw7NFQ1u4TsWjHg1ab5446xP5kHfFLgKn9Z69bG3mK1op6AE78m9serQSbzDBmgnrAHi6kFUFNvdQak2azxpCwm3QnL7CDg6RDo3wXK8Da5xF5h5WiwVM9sudxsAAy4AQJJ5jUjoUcJC9G49uTCczzHLZ8pw3MoR6PdqAnfBHC\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dinosaur-Silicone-Generation-Accessories-Compatible/dp/B0BKYDDJV1?th=1\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/RADNkTB2Qu41rYRMhgSNCmEW4KYM4tyPaAFBhMbE3G7MrWYRb5EJNmRxXMcs3izjZtFHtW4e6DfNu3Jd6LsMpwmyjkYRVqyEGjx8WrupizCV6d1rHE2FL4Sus67z4N84yiCdPFgH3aY7wvnbG2UU75CjD9cZqSMgg7UvL9qCLfrXQf3aoWj2AvYeXdonV4jPBzkuUNvFaE74mw7NFQ1u4TsWjHg1ab5446xP5kHfFLgKn9Z69bG3mK1op6AE78m9serQSbzDBmgnrAHi6kFUFNvdQak2azxpCwm3QnL7CDg6RDo3wXK8Da5xF5h5WiwVM9sudxsAAy4AQJJ5jUjoUcJC9G49uTCczzHLZ8pw3MoR6PdqAnfBHC\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Cute Dinosaur AirPods Case for $14</a>:</strong> This case isn't just super cute, it does a great job of protecting the AirPods case.

My favorite thing about this set is that, in addition to the earcup covers, you also get covers for the earpad and headband. I have two gripes though‚Äîthe cutouts aren't <em>exact,</em> but still accessible, and the silicone attracts tiny dust particles that can be frustrating to pick off. The additional pieces make for a tighter fit of the headphones on your head, which is ideal for me because the AirPods Max tend to slide off my head. <em>Compatible with AirPods Max</em></p><h2>Avoid These Cases</h2><p><strong><a class=\"external-link\" data-aps-asc-tag=\"w050b-20\" data-aps-asin=\"B097QQCZC7\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/nntVzjQ3JMLounNPYNrETBFpnx1VA7KTTdFY2v3FEq9o5tvzKhipnnpZJGT8FywevpfYzH7UKwVewWXKyVTcbDWwa9pqT7Pay4QSSCtcxSTNLYSn4krwrdnXQn54gAkj5BdbJ7rs63vQVq2DdrfMkNBVq8WYPvKArPdZyhCGXcmjWEpiyoabR38QZpyrqeGAvrfxPcmaAPhhnqjwA2WMrwYr4Ts5TpsJ7qDCVSYgroTF5kRazD1xfUYgjeRpHv8qJnpF7NQcJwZH98NYoUyMDsC99azsVN1jjbJM84Vx\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097QQCZC7\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/nntVzjQ3JMLounNPYNrETBFpnx1VA7KTTdFY2v3FEq9o5tvzKhipnnpZJGT8FywevpfYzH7UKwVewWXKyVTcbDWwa9pqT7Pay4QSSCtcxSTNLYSn4krwrdnXQn54gAkj5BdbJ7rs63vQVq2DdrfMkNBVq8WYPvKArPdZyhCGXcmjWEpiyoabR38QZpyrqeGAvrfxPcmaAPhhnqjwA2WMrwYr4Ts5TpsJ7qDCVSYgroTF5kRazD1xfUYgjeRpHv8qJnpF7NQcJwZH98NYoUyMDsC99azsVN1jjbJM84Vx\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Jiunai Pop-It AirPods 2 Case for $7</a>:</strong> My hands are in constant need of fidgeting, so naturally, I love a fidget toy to keep me occupied.

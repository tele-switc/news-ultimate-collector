    "content_text": "A research facility within the US National Institutes of Health that is tasked with studying Ebola and other deadly infectious diseases has been instructed by the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to stop research activities.\nAccording to an email viewed by WIRED, the Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Maryland, was told to stop all experimental work by April 29 at 5 pm. The facility is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and is located at the US Army base Fort Detrick. It conducts research on the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases that are deemed “high consequence”—those that pose significant risks to public health. It has 168 employees, including federal workers and contractors.\nThe email, sent by Michael Holbrook, associate director for high containment at the Integrated Research Facility, says the lab is terminating studies on Lassa fever, SARS-Cov-2, and Eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, a rare but lethal mosquito-borne disease that has been reported in several northern US states. “We are collecting as many samples as is reasonable to ensure these studies are of value,” he says in the email. “We have not been asked to euthanize any animals so these animals will continue to be managed.” Holbrook did not respond to an inquiry from WIRED.\nThe email says representatives from the Department of Homeland Security were padlocking freezers in biosafety-level-4 labs, those with the highest level of biosafety containment used for studying highly dangerous microbes. Only about a dozen BSL-4 labs exist in North America. These labs work with the viruses that cause Ebola, Lassa fever, and Marburg, types of hemorrhagic fevers. The Integrated Research Facility is one of only a few places in the world that is able to perform medical imaging on animals infected with BSL-4 agents.\n“The sacrifice to research is immense,” says Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, on the closure. “If things are unused for a period of time, it will cost more money to get them ready to be used again.”\nThe facility’s director, Connie Schmaljohn, has also been placed on administrative leave, according to the email. Previously, Schmaljohn served as a senior research scientist at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. She has more than 200 research publications, and her work has led to several clinical trials of first-of-their-kind vaccines. Schmaljohn also did not respond to an inquiry from WIRED.\nIn an emailed statement provided to WIRED, Bradley Moss, communication director for the office of research services at NIH, confirmed the halt in research activity. “NIH has implemented a research pause—referred to as a safety stand-down—at the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick. This decision follows identification and documentation of personnel issues involving contract staff that compromised the facility’s safety culture, prompting this research pause. During the stand-down, no research will be conducted, and access will be limited to essential personnel only, to safeguard the facility and its resources.”\nMoss did not elaborate on the nature of the personnel issues and said he did not know how long the research pause would last. Staff have not received an anticipated reopening date.\nThe research pause is the latest disruption to federal science agencies after HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced at the end of March that 10,000 people across the vast federal health agency would lose their jobs, including those at the National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The mass layoffs are part of a restructuring plan being carried out by President Donald Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency.",

    "content_text": "In September 2023, Adam Raines made a Reddit post revealing what feels like a near-universal problem for singles: His dating app conversations are painfully boring.\nAttached to the post, titled “Sometimes, texting on dating apps feelings (sic) like hitting your head against a brick wall,” is a screenshot of a bone-dry Tinder conversation between him and one of his matches, in which Raines’ curiosity is met with short, dead-ended answers.\n“The vast majority of my online dating interactions have been like that,” says Raines, 25, a gay man living in the UK who asked to use a pseudonym to protect his privacy.\nMany users in the thread echoed his sentiment and offered explanations or theories as to why conversations on dating apps are often unsatisfying. “I see I'm not the only one getting that type of energy lol,” one wrote, as another noted, “It sucks, and if people swiped more mindfully this wouldn’t happen, but a lot of guys are so beaten down by the dating app experience they feel like they don’t have any other choice and want whatever validation they can get.”\nPeople are sick of dating apps. Chatting feels like a chore, most conversations lead nowhere, and the novelty of swiping has worn off. Attempts to identify the apps’ critical flaws and theorize about how the profit incentive has run the user experience into the ground have proliferated over the past few years. Desirable potential matches are locked behind paywalls; matches and likes are limited. But some of the most ubiquitous dating apps seem to be suggesting that the problem may not be solved with better UX, algorithms, or paywalls—but by users learning how to actually talk to people.\nTinder, Hinge, Bumble, and Grindr are all rolling out features aimed at helping people court romantic partners and banter more successfully, suggesting an industry-wide reckoning with young users’ lack of dating experience.\n“We can't solve for the fact that human interactions can be stressful or people may be apprehensive about them at times, but we can help make it more fun, and we can help you prepare,” Hillary Paine, Tinder’s VP of product growth and revenue, tells WIRED.\nA study from The Survey Center on American Life found that only 56 percent of Gen Z adults said they were involved in a romantic relationship as teenagers, compared to 78 percent of baby boomers and 76 percent of Gen Xers. In a 2024 report, Hinge found that its Gen Z users in particular struggle in dating, and many of them attribute their unease in dating to the pandemic: They were 47 percent more likely than millennial users to say the pandemic made them nervous talking to new people and 25 percent more likely to say it lowered their confidence on a first date.\nIn March, Tinder partnered with OpenAI to launch The Game Game, which drops users into hyper-specific scenarios that have the potential to become flirtatious. An AI-generated voice begins flirting with you, and you—the user—are prompted to respond via your own voice.\nI’m given the following scenario: I’m at a friend’s housewarming party and accidentally break a vase that it turns out was a gift for the host brought by 35-year-old Caleb, a financial analyst from Annapolis, Maryland. “How will you handle this?” the screen reads. After responding to Caleb—a very eager robot with a deep voice who calls me “hon” in nearly every sentence—with one-word answers that indicate my discomfort with seducing a computer, Tinder suggests that I “engage more in shared interests,” “provide more details about your hobbies,” and “show enthusiasm in the conversation.”\nAnnouncement of the game was met with scorn by some social media users.\n“This is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen,” one person posted on X, while another said, “I already know I don’t have game. I don’t need ai to confirm it for me.”\n“This was really meant to be sort of fun and campy,” says Paine, describing the prompts presented as “intentionally over-the-top rom-com scenarios.” According to Paine, internal research that informed this new feature indicated that one in four young daters said they lacked confidence in their flirting skills. “We built it as a way to give users a fun, safe playground to practice flirting so that they could go into real-life connections and scenarios with more confidence.” The Game Game is targeting daters between the ages of 18 and 22, not only because of their shortcomings in dating but because they expressed a willingness to allow AI into their dating experience, she says.\nRaines says he’s “not hopeful” that a bot’s language models “are robust and realistic enough to properly simulate, or ‘teach,’ online flirting.”\nWhile flirtations between humans and chatbots are becoming increasingly controversial, Tinder is framing its use of interactive AI as an aid to, rather than a force in conflict with, real-life dating. Tinder will analyze how its members use the feature to determine the future of voice-to-voice interactions on the app.\nAI is “a really big part of Tinder's road map,” Paine says.\nTinder is not alone in that. Grindr has been testing a beta version of an AI wingman that can craft witty messages for users; the app is partnering with Amazon and Anthropic for wingman’s A-list feature, which will be able to prioritize past connections and summarize conversations, Bloomberg reported.\nReal-life dating experts are also addressing their clients’ lack of rizz—and anxieties around talking to strangers.\n“Men really hate the apps right now, and they're wanting to do a more in-person approach, but it's really scary because people don't know what to say,” says Emyli Lovz, who runs a dating and relationship coaching business. Her company offers not only human-to-human conversation practice but also full-fledged mock dates to help improve clients’ skills in conversation, flirting, and sexual escalation.\nShe attributes the phenomenon to the fallout of Covid-related social isolation but says some of her male clients also express a fear of coming off as “creepy.”\n“I know the guys in my community love being able to practice their conversation skills in a judgment free environment where someone's just going to give them feedback.”\nFlirting via the apps, on the other hand, poses an entirely new challenge: making your pickup line stand out among a sea of generic introductions.\n“Everybody wants to say ‘Hi, hey, what's up, cutie?’ It becomes totally meaningless, even though that's what you could say in person easily,” Lovz tells WIRED. “It doesn't work on the apps because there are so many people on them that if you get that message a million times as a woman, you're like, ‘Please don't ever send me that message again.’ So there's a lot of coaching that could happen around the messages.”\nAccording to Hinge, part of Gen Z’s hesitancy in flirting with new people comes from a fear of coming off as “cringey” or “overeager.” But the app’s love and connections expert, Ari Brown, recommends younger users “embrace Cringe Mode” by “doing something that requires vulnerability or risking rejection.”\nIn March, as part of its “One More Hour” campaign that encourages members of Gen Z to engage in more in-person interactions, Hinge released its guide to building connections, a step-by-step guide to starting and escalating both romantic and nonromantic relationships, which includes fill-in-the-blank suggestions to help users build momentum after meeting someone in person: “Hey friend! It was great meeting you at (social group). You mentioned that you like (insert activity). I love that too. Want to go together this weekend?” reads one prompt.\nBumble’s Instant Match, meanwhile, claims it eliminates the need for “awkward exchanges” by allowing users to match with one another by scanning users’ QR codes out in the wild. The feature, which the app says is primarily intended to serve attendees of Bumble’s “IRL” events, lets users skip the banter typical of a meet-cute by providing the two participants with a list of their shared interests, theoretically helping them more efficiently determine their compatibility. While Instant Match seems to tacitly acknowledge that Bumble’s users struggle with small talk, it’s not clear how it would help them improve on that front.\nAs apps like Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and Grindr realize that a user base of socially inept daters is making them look bad, a larger push to catch younger daters up on basic conversational skills (or eliminate the need for them) might be inevitable. But whether the tools on offer are actually useful remains to be seen.\nIn the two years since his Reddit post seeking advice, Raines says, he hasn’t met up with anyone from the apps. Though he still struggles to converse with potential mates online, he’s not convinced AI-based features in particular offer a long-term solution.\n“There is perhaps a benefit in helping people who are unsuccessful feel less alone, maybe? Boosting their confidence? But in improving the dating app experience in any marked way? No.”",

    "content_text": "A young man with no government experience who has yet to even complete his undergraduate degree is working for Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and has been tasked with using artificial intelligence to rewrite the agency’s rules and regulations.\nChristopher Sweet was introduced to HUD employees as being originally from San Francisco and most recently a third-year at the University of Chicago, where he was studying economics and data science, in an email sent to staffers earlier this month.\n“I'd like to share with you that Chris Sweet has joined the HUD DOGE team with the title of special assistant, although a better title might be ‘Al computer programming quant analyst,’” Scott Langmack, a DOGE staffer and chief operating officer of an AI real estate company, wrote in an email widely shared within the agency and reviewed by WIRED. “With family roots from Brazil, Chris speaks Portuguese fluently. Please join me in welcoming Chris to HUD!”\nSweet’s primary role appears to be leading an effort to leverage artificial intelligence to review HUD’s regulations, compare them to the laws on which they are based, and identify areas where rules can be relaxed or removed altogether. (He has also been given read access to HUD's data repository on public housing, known as the Public and Indian Housing Information Center, and its enterprise income verification systems, according to sources within the agency.)\nPlans for the industrial-scale deregulation of the US government were laid out in detail in the Project 2025 policy document that the Trump administration has effectively used as a playbook during its first 100 days in power. The document, written by a who’s who of far-right figures, many of whom now hold positions of power within the administration, pushes for deregulation in areas like the environment, food and drug enforcement, and diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.\nOne area Sweet is focusing on is regulation related to the Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH), according to sources who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the press.\nSweet—who two sources have been told is the lead on the AI deregulation project for the entire administration—has produced an Excel spreadsheet with around a thousand rows containing areas of policy where the AI tool has flagged that HUD may have “overreached” and suggesting replacement language.\nStaffers from PIH are, specifically, asked to review the AI’s recommendations and justify their objections to those they don’t agree with. “It all sounds crazy—having AI recommend revisions to regulations,” one HUD source says. “But I appreciated how much they’re using real people to confirm and make changes.”\nOnce the PIH team completes the review, their recommendations will be submitted to the Office of the General Counsel for approval.\nOne HUD source says they were told that the AI model being used for this project is “being refined by our work to be used across the government.” To do this, the source says they were told in a meeting attended by Sweet and Jacob Altik, another known DOGE member who has worked as an attorney at Weil, Gotshal & Mangesthat, the model will crawl through the Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR),\nAnother source told WIRED that Sweet has also been using the tool at other parts of HUD. WIRED reviewed a copy of the output of the AI’s review of one HUD department, which features columns displaying text that the AI model found to be needing an adjustment while also including suggestions from the AI for alterations to be made, essentially proposing rewrites. The spreadsheet details how many words can be eliminated from individual regulations and gives a percentage figure indicating how noncompliant the regulations are. It isn’t clear how these percentages are calculated.\nSweet did not respond to requests for comment regarding his work. In response to a request to clarify Sweet’s role at HUD, a spokesperson for the agency said they do not comment on individual personnel. The University of Chicago confirmed to WIRED that Sweet is “on leave from the undergraduate college.”\nIt’s unclear how Sweet was recruited to DOGE, but a public GitHub account indicates that he was working on this issue even before he joined Musk’s demolition crew.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at davidgilbert.01 and vittoria89.82.\nThe “CLSweet” GitHub account, which WIRED has linked to Sweet, created an application that tracks and analyzes federal government regulations “showing how regulatory burden is distributed across government agencies.” The application was last updated in March 2025, weeks before Sweet joined HUD.\nOne HUD source who heard about Sweet’s possible role in revising the agency’s regulations said the effort was redundant, since the agency was already “put through a multi-year multi-stakeholder meatgrinder before any rule was ever created” under the Administrative Procedure Act. (This law dictates how agencies are allowed to establish regulations and allows for judicial oversight over everything an agency does.)\nAnother HUD source said Sweet’s title seemed to make little sense. “A programmer and a quantitative data analyst are two very different things,” they noted.\nSweet has virtually no online footprint. One of the only references to him online is a short biography on the website of East Edge Securities, an investment firm Sweet founded in 2023 with two other students from the University of Chicago.\nThe biography is short on details but claims that Sweet has worked in the past with several private equity firms, including Pertento Partners, which is based in London, and Tenzing Global Investors, based in San Francisco. He is also listed as a board member of Paragon Global Investments, which is a student-run hedge fund.\nThe biography also mentions that Sweet “will be joining Nexus Point Capital as a private equity summer analyst.” The company has headquarters in Hong Kong and Shanghai and describes itself as “an Asian private equity fund with a strategic focus on control opportunities in the Greater China market.”\nEast Edge Securities, Pertento Partners, Tenzing Global Investors, Paragon Global Investments, and Nexus Point Capital did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe only other online account associated with Sweet appears to be a Substack account using the same username as the GitHub account. That account has not posted any content and follows mostly finance and market-related newsletters. It also follows Bari Weiss’ The Free Press and the newsletter of Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley billionaire investor and group chat enthusiast who said he spent a lot of time advising Trump and his team after the election.\nDOGE representatives have been at HUD since February, when WIRED reported that two of those staffers were given application-level access to some of the most critical and sensitive systems inside the agency.\nEarlier this month, US representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said DOGE had “infiltrated our nation’s housing agencies, stealing funding Congress provided to communities, illegally terminating staff, including in your districts, and accessing confidential data about people living in assisted housing, including sexual assault survivors.”",

(This law dictates how agencies are allowed to establish regulations and allows for judicial oversight over everything an agency does.)</p><p class=\"paywall\">Another HUD source said Sweet’s title seemed to make little sense. “A programmer and a quantitative data analyst are two very different things,” they noted.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Sweet has virtually no online footprint. One of the only references to him online is <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.eastedgesecurities.com/founders\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.eastedgesecurities.com/founders\" href=\"https://www.eastedgesecurities.com/founders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a short biography</a> on the website of East Edge Securities, an investment firm Sweet founded in 2023 with two other students from the University of Chicago.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The biography is short on details but claims that Sweet has worked in the past with several private equity firms, including Pertento Partners, which is based in London, and Tenzing Global Investors, based in San Francisco. He is also listed as a board member of Paragon Global Investments, which is a student-run hedge fund.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The biography also mentions that Sweet “will be joining Nexus Point Capital as a private equity summer analyst.” The company has headquarters in Hong Kong and Shanghai and <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/nexus-point-capital/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/nexus-point-capital/\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/nexus-point-capital/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">describes itself</a> as “an Asian private equity fund with a strategic focus on control opportunities in the Greater China market.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">East Edge Securities, Pertento Partners, Tenzing Global Investors, Paragon Global Investments, and Nexus Point Capital did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The only other online account associated with Sweet appears to be a Substack account using the same username as the GitHub account. That account has not posted any content and follows mostly finance and market-related newsletters. It also follows Bari Weiss’ The Free Press and the newsletter of Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley billionaire investor and <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.semafor.com/article/04/27/2025/the-group-chats-that-changed-america\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/04/27/2025/the-group-chats-that-changed-america\" href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/04/27/2025/the-group-chats-that-changed-america\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">group chat enthusiast</a> who said he <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://fortune.com/2024/12/11/marc-andreessen-half-time-florida-trump-business-policies/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://fortune.com/2024/12/11/marc-andreessen-half-time-florida-trump-business-policies/\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/12/11/marc-andreessen-half-time-florida-trump-business-policies/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">spent a lot of time advising Trump and his team</a> after the election.</p><p class=\"paywall\">DOGE representatives have been at HUD since February, when <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hud-systems-access-ai-proptech-real-estate-mobile-home/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WIRED reported</a> that two of those staffers were given application-level access to some of the most critical and sensitive systems inside the agency.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Earlier this month, US representative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said DOGE had “infiltrated our nation’s housing agencies, stealing funding Congress provided to communities, illegally terminating staff, including in your districts, and accessing confidential data about people living in assisted housing, including sexual assault survivors.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "AI-generated computer code is rife with references to nonexistent third-party libraries, creating a golden opportunity for supply-chain attacks that poison legitimate programs with malicious packages that can steal data, plant backdoors, and carry out other nefarious actions, newly published research shows.\nThe study, which used 16 of the most widely used large language models to generate 576,000 code samples, found that 440,000 of the package dependencies they contained were “hallucinated,” meaning they were nonexistent. Open source models hallucinated the most, with 21 percent of the dependencies linking to nonexistent libraries. A dependency is an essential code component that a separate piece of code requires to work properly. Dependencies save developers the hassle of rewriting code and are an essential part of the modern software supply chain.\nPackage Hallucination Flashbacks\nThese nonexistent dependencies represent a threat to the software supply chain by exacerbating so-called dependency confusion attacks. These attacks work by causing a software package to access the wrong component dependency, for instance by publishing a malicious package and giving it the same name as the legitimate one but with a later version stamp. Software that depends on the package will, in some cases, choose the malicious version rather than the legitimate one because the former appears to be more recent.\nAlso known as package confusion, this form of attack was first demonstrated in 2021 in a proof-of-concept exploit that executed counterfeit code on networks belonging to some of the biggest companies on the planet, Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla included. It's one type of technique used in software supply-chain attacks, which aim to poison software at its very source in an attempt to infect all users downstream.\n“Once the attacker publishes a package under the hallucinated name, containing some malicious code, they rely on the model suggesting that name to unsuspecting users,” Joseph Spracklen, a University of Texas at San Antonio PhD student and lead researcher, told Ars via email. “If a user trusts the LLM's output and installs the package without carefully verifying it, the attacker’s payload, hidden in the malicious package, would be executed on the user's system.”\nIn AI, hallucinations occur when an LLM produces outputs that are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or completely unrelated to the task it was assigned. Hallucinations have long dogged LLMs because they degrade their usefulness and trustworthiness and have proven vexingly difficult to predict and remedy. In a paper scheduled to be presented at the 2025 USENIX Security Symposium, they have dubbed the phenomenon “package hallucination.”\nFor the study, the researchers ran 30 tests, 16 in the Python programming language and 14 in JavaScript, that generated 19,200 code samples per test, for a total of 576,000 code samples. Of the 2.23 million package references contained in those samples, 440,445, or 19.7 percent, pointed to packages that didn’t exist. Among these 440,445 package hallucinations, 205,474 had unique package names.\nOne of the things that makes package hallucinations potentially useful in supply-chain attacks is that 43 percent of package hallucinations were repeated over 10 queries. “In addition,” the researchers wrote, “58 percent of the time, a hallucinated package is repeated more than once in 10 iterations, which shows that the majority of hallucinations are not simply random errors but a repeatable phenomenon that persists across multiple iterations. This is significant, because a persistent hallucination is more valuable for malicious actors looking to exploit this vulnerability and makes the hallucination attack vector a more viable threat.”\nIn other words, many package hallucinations aren’t random, one-off errors. Rather, specific names of nonexistent packages are repeated over and over. Attackers could seize on the pattern by identifying nonexistent packages that are repeatedly hallucinated. The attackers would then publish malware using those names and wait for them to be accessed by large numbers of developers.\nThe study uncovered disparities in the LLMs and programming languages that produced the most package hallucinations. The average percentage of package hallucinations produced by open source LLMs such as CodeLlama and DeepSeek was nearly 22 percent, compared with a little more than 5 percent by commercial models. Code written in Python resulted in fewer hallucinations than JavaScript code, with an average of almost 16 percent compared with a little over 21 percent for JavaScript. Asked what caused the differences, Spracklen wrote:\n“This is a difficult question because large language models are extraordinarily complex systems, making it hard to directly trace causality. That said, we observed a significant disparity between commercial models (such as the ChatGPT series) and open-source models, which is almost certainly attributable to the much larger parameter counts of the commercial variants. Most estimates suggest that ChatGPT models have at least 10 times more parameters than the open-source models we tested, though the exact architecture and training details remain proprietary. Interestingly, among open-source models, we did not find a clear link between model size and hallucination rate, likely because they all operate within a relatively smaller parameter range.\n“Beyond model size, differences in training data, fine-tuning, instruction training, and safety tuning all likely play a role in package hallucination rate. These processes are intended to improve model usability and reduce certain types of errors, but they may have unforeseen downstream effects on phenomena like package hallucination.\n“Similarly, the higher hallucination rate for JavaScript packages compared to Python is also difficult to attribute definitively. We speculate that it stems from the fact that JavaScript has roughly 10 times more packages in its ecosystem than Python, combined with a more complicated namespace. With a much larger and more complex package landscape, it becomes harder for models to accurately recall specific package names, leading to greater uncertainty in their internal predictions and, ultimately, a higher rate of hallucinated packages.”\nThe findings are the latest to demonstrate the inherent untrustworthiness of LLM output. With Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott predicting that 95 percent of code will be AI-generated within five years, here’s hoping developers heed the message.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

I'm WIRED's director of business and industry Zoë Schiffer. Well, we're 100 days in to Trump's second term in office and we're all waiting to see what happens with the tariff standoff with China. Especially for businesses of all sizes that absolutely depend on international trade. In some cases, the setbacks have been so significant that businesses with set production cycles are saying that might not even meet their deadlines. One of those deadlines is pretty important because it's Christmas. Today on the show, I'm joined by WIRED's senior business editor Louise Matsakis to talk the latest on tariffs. Welcome to Uncanny Valley, Louise.\nLouise Matsakis: Hey, Zoë. Thanks for having me.\nZoë Schiffer: Let's dive right in because we had some reporting on WIRED this week about Christmas specifically. I guess the first question to kick things off is is Christmas canceled?\nLouise Matsakis: Well, it definitely could be. I think that we're certainly in danger of missing a bunch of deadlines for, like you said, production cycles for things like artificial trees to be produced, decorations, toys for kids to put under the tree. All of those things start happening now in April.\nZoë Schiffer: I think that that's a little bit counterintuitive for a lot of people. It definitely was for me when Zeyi, our reporter, started working on this story. The idea that these companies in the United States need to anticipate what they're going to need for Christmas now is mind-blowing.\nLouise Matsakis: Totally. If you think about it though, it makes a lot of sense. The first thing you need to do is negotiate with the suppliers, agree on designs, finalize product orders. Then it takes about two to three months for the manufacturing to actually happen. For all of those ornaments to be produced, for the decorations to put on, for everything to be packaged. Then it can take another one to two months just for those items to cross the Pacific Ocean and get to the US, and then be distributed to different retailers and warehouses across the country from there. That gets us to about mid-September to October. By, I feel like it gets earlier and earlier every year, but around November, Christmas stuff starts hitting shelves.\nZoë Schiffer: It seems like there are also a bunch of products where consumers might be able to eat the cost, but when we're talking about ornaments, and trees, and stuff like that, you just really can't set the price that much higher, right?\nLouise Matsakis: Yeah. These are essentially non-essentials. These are the types of items that you don't necessarily need to buy, but that make life more fun, or perhaps make Christmas magical.\nZoë Schiffer: Based on Zeyi's reporting, how are manufacturers doing right now?\nLouise Matsakis: There's two sides of the coin. On one side are the business owners, the retailers in the US, and then there are the manufacturers in China. The retailers are basically saying, \"These tariffs are so high that we have to cancel or pause our orders.\" The manufacturers are saying, \"Well, without orders, we have to close down our production lines.\" Or in a lot of cases, they're trying to pivot to other markets. Zeyi Yang, our senior China reporter, had this amazing anecdote about people in China who make Santa decorations, Santa figurines. They're trying to make Santa's face more European. Apparently, it's a slightly wider Santa in Europe that they prefer, an old-school Santa look. They're trying to pivot to making more figurines like that, instead of the chubby, jolly Santa that we prefer in the United States.\nZoë Schiffer: Oh my gosh, OK. Is anyone winning as a result of these tariffs? Is this a total boon to people who manufacture ornaments in the United States? Or is that market just incredibly small?\nLouise Matsakis: I think aside from really small crafters who make ornaments and maybe other sorts of decorations here, it's basically a non-existent market. Even those crafters and small businesses, they're probably getting their craft supplies from China in the first place. This is not really benefiting any US manufacturing. There's not a renaissance of Christmas decorations happening.\nZoë Schiffer: While I'm curious to see how this all plays out, I feel like if there's anything that will get Americans to riot in the streets, it's prices on Amazon going on, and/or their Christmas decorations getting too expensive. We'll take a quick break. When we come back, we'll talk about the impact on ecommerce goods in particular. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. This weekend, we saw companies like Shein and Temu hike their prices as a result of Trump's 145% tariffs on China. Let's talk about the impact of tariffs on ecommerce. Louise, I feel like this is maybe a core area of expertise for you. Can you get us started?\nLouise Matsakis: Yes. What's happening on Shein and Temu is my personal Roman Empire. What we're seeing, particularly on Temu thus far, is that they are actually adding a line item when you go to check out that shows the price of the tariffs. Yesterday, I just added about $32 worth of random goods to my shopping cart, and then I could see that there was a $44 tariff charge that was added on top. I think that's a really savvy move because it shows consumers exactly why they're seeing a price increase. I think it's also helpful for Shein and Temu, which have been pivoting even before these tariffs were announced to other markets, like Europe and Latin America. Those goods can stay roughly the same price in those markets, but it's just the American consumers that will see that added charge near where you see the added taxes.\nZoë Schiffer: Got it, OK. Obviously, that makes sense for logistical reasons. It's easier to just add a tariff charge than raise the price of individual goods. But is it also a way to subtly exert pressure on the Trump Administration, or am I over-interpreting things?\nLouise Matsakis: I don't think that you are. I think it sends a pretty clear political message. That these charges are because your country has these really high tariffs. I think it's definitely a subtle message that these companies are sending. I think Temu in particular is a mystery. They don't have any lobbyists on Capitol Hill. They rarely if ever respond to media requests from journalists like me. It's interesting to see them I think doing something that is politically savvy in this case, whereas most of the time they're either silent or they're policy decisions seem a little bit haphazard.\nZoë Schiffer: Like you said, for at least Temu and Shein, it's a line item right now. We're not seeing the price of individual goods really change at this point. But is that true across the board, or are there some items in particular that we should be worried about?\nLouise Matsakis: The types of items that you should look out for are things that really can't be made anywhere else. That's stuff like electronics, anything that's plastic. A lot of stuff for parents. Strollers, baby gear, baby toys, baby clothes, all of those things are almost entirely made in China. These are also product categories where the margins are already pretty thin, so there's not that much wiggle room for the manufacturer or the American brand to eat the cost themselves. These are items that are often already somewhere between 10 to $30.\nZoë Schiffer: Right, OK. Well, I won't put you on blast and make you talk about the things that you've stocked up on recently.\nLouise Matsakis: I'm happy to share with our dear readers that I sent Zoë a horrifying photo the other day of an ungodly number of makeup sponges that I panic ordered on Temu the other day, because I refuse to go back to spending, whatever, $11 that Sephora charges for one of these.\nZoë Schiffer: 100%. This is a little bit of a pivot, but I feel like you and I have talked a lot about how it's not as simple as just opening up production facilities in the United States. There's a lot that goes into China being so dominant in the space. I'm wondering if you can just talk us through that briefly?\nLouise Matsakis: I think that there's this narrative that all these jobs left the United States and they went to China when China joined the World Trade Organization at the turn of the century. But that's a really simplistic narrative. The reality is that 20 years ago, a lot of the products that we're talking about right now, makeup sponges, iPhones, small electronics, the insulated Stanley cup that I'm looking at right now on my desk, these products literally did not exist. It's not as though these supply chains moved from the US to China, it's that they were built entirely from the ground up in China. That includes things like the machinery. How do you do an injection molding to make this plastic cup out of a mold? Those machines were built, designed, manufactured, and maintained in China from the time that they were invented. It's really difficult to move that entire supply chain to the US. In China, the government has totally organized itself around supporting this type of enterprise. Where, in the US, we just don't have any of that infrastructure in place, whether it's even the most basic things. Roads, ports, land available to open giant factories, talent pipelines. We don't have a high school you can go to here to become a garment worker, which is a very common thing in China.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. I think it's so interesting, because I feel like prior to talking to you for many hours a day, I had the misconception that a lot of people have, that made in China was a synonym for cheaply made. But you've told me again and again that actually, the quality of manufacturing in China is far superior. When you talk to companies in the United States that have tried to source from the US versus China, what they'll say is that the US quality just absolutely isn't there.\nLouise Matsakis: Totally. I think it's just we don't have the supply chains in place. I think in China, you can definitely get cheap manufacturing, but I think that one thing people don't always understand is that if you're Walmart, your signature thing is that you have low prices. You're going to put pressure on your suppliers in China to ensure that prices remain low. If prices are low, then the manufacturing is not going to be high quality. I think that that's the type of retailer that a lot of people are historically familiar with when it comes to things made in China. But you can go to a much nicer store, and the stuff is still made in China and the prices are higher. It's just maybe less in your face or it's less discussed when you go to William Sonoma or to, back in the day we used to call Target Tar-jay when it was the nicer retailer. But it doesn't mean that it's coming from a different place, it just depends on the economics of that particular item.\nZoë Schiffer: Then just getting back to the Christmas of it all, if they don't put in their orders now, those facilities in China that are working 24 hours or whatever, they conceivably would either have to pivot their manufacturing or lay people off. Which would mean that even if the tariff situation is resolved, we won't be able to get stuff back and working in a timeframe that would allow Christmas to proceed as usual.\nLouise Matsakis: Yeah, there's two things to consider here. One is that, let's say tomorrow, Trump totally changes his mind, which is perfectly possible. There's going to be a stampede to resume orders. All of a sudden, these factories that have been sitting idle for almost a month now are going to have to ramp up production immediately. Retailers are going to have to pay a premium to get space on that factory line, or to be prioritized, to have their orders made first and put on ships as quickly as possible. Prices are still going to be higher for consumers. The other thing is that if this goes on for too long and these workers and these factories don't have jobs anymore, a lot of them are going to go home. In many cases, these are migrant workers who come from more rural parts of China and they actually live onsite often at the factory. They live and work in the same place. They often do these long stints where they'll work six or sometimes seven days a week for a few months, and then take that money and go back where they're from, see their kids, see their families. If there's no more work, there's no reason for them to stay there. This isn't their home, this is not where they're from. It's really hard when that happens for factories to get those workers to come back immediately.\nZoë Schiffer: Also, very hard to imagine even a remotely similar scenario playing out in the United States if we were able to open big manufacturing facilities here.\nLouise Matsakis: Yeah, I can't see that many Americans wanting to live in a dorm with 12 of their coworkers on the factory line. But let me know! Send me an email if you're interested in that setup for sure, because I would love to talk to you about it.\nZoë Schiffer: We're going to take another quick break. Up next, our favorite reads on WIRED.com this week. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry. I'm joined today by WIRED's senior business editor Louise Matsakis. Before we go, Louise, tell our listeners what they absolutely have to read on WIRED.com today. Other than the stories we mentioned in this piece, obviously.\nLouise Matsakis: Speaking of online shopping, OpenAI is now getting into the ecommerce business. I highly recommend people read Reese Rogers, another one of our AI reporters, did a deep dive on how OpenAI's new shopping integration works. It's super fascinating. I think it'll be really interesting if, in a few years, when we all want to buy something that is now much higher in price because of tariffs, maybe we all start asking ChatGPT how to find the best deal.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm a little worried about this because I feel like one reason that I like ChatGPT's search so much better than Google's is because it doesn't have horrendous ads all over the place. I feel like we are inevitably inching closer to a world in which they look more similar.\nLouise Matsakis: Yeah, I agree.\nZoë Schiffer: OK. The piece that I want to recommend is Natasha Bernal's piece from yesterday about the major blackout that hit basically the entirety of Portugal and Spain, and also small regions of France. This was obviously major news that we woke up to yesterday. She had a really good angle on it, on basically how difficult it is to get the grid back up and running. Experts she talked to said it will take several hours to several days.

It's easier to just add a tariff charge than raise the price of individual goods. But is it also a way to subtly exert pressure on the Trump Administration, or am I over-interpreting things?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Louise Matsakis:</strong> I don't think that you are. I think it sends a pretty clear political message. That these charges are because your country has these really high tariffs. I think it's definitely a subtle message that these companies are sending. I think Temu in particular is a mystery. They don't have any lobbyists on Capitol Hill. They rarely if ever respond to media requests from journalists like me. It's interesting to see them I think doing something that is politically savvy in this case, whereas most of the time they're either silent or they're policy decisions seem a little bit haphazard.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> Like you said, for at least Temu and Shein, it's a line item right now. We're not seeing the price of individual goods really change at this point. But is that true across the board, or are there some items in particular that we should be worried about?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Louise Matsakis:</strong> The types of items that you should look out for are things that really can't be made anywhere else. That's stuff like electronics, anything that's plastic. A lot of stuff for parents. Strollers, baby gear, baby toys, baby clothes, all of those things are almost entirely made in China. These are also product categories where the margins are already pretty thin, so there's not that much wiggle room for the manufacturer or the American brand to eat the cost themselves. These are items that are often already somewhere between 10 to $30.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> Right, OK. Well, I won't put you on blast and make you talk about the things that you've stocked up on recently.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Louise Matsakis:</strong> I'm happy to share with our dear readers that I sent Zoë a horrifying photo the other day of an ungodly number of makeup sponges that I panic ordered on Temu the other day, because I refuse to go back to spending, whatever, $11 that Sephora charges for one of these.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> 100%. This is a little bit of a pivot, but I feel like you and I have talked a lot about how it's not as simple as just opening up production facilities in the United States. There's a lot that goes into China being so dominant in the space. I'm wondering if you can just talk us through that briefly?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Louise Matsakis:</strong> I think that there's this narrative that all these jobs left the United States and they went to China when China joined the World Trade Organization at the turn of the century. But that's a really simplistic narrative. The reality is that 20 years ago, a lot of the products that we're talking about right now, makeup sponges, iPhones, small electronics, the insulated Stanley cup that I'm looking at right now on my desk, these products literally did not exist. It's not as though these supply chains moved from the US to China, it's that they were built entirely from the ground up in China. That includes things like the machinery. How do you do an injection molding to make this plastic cup out of a mold? Those machines were built, designed, manufactured, and maintained in China from the time that they were invented. It's really difficult to move that entire supply chain to the US. In China, the government has totally organized itself around supporting this type of enterprise. Where, in the US, we just don't have any of that infrastructure in place, whether it's even the most basic things. Roads, ports, land available to open giant factories, talent pipelines. We don't have a high school you can go to here to become a garment worker, which is a very common thing in China.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Researchers have trained a new kind of large language model (LLM) using GPUs dotted across the world and fed private as well as public data—a move that suggests that the dominant way of building artificial intelligence could be disrupted.\nFlower AI and Vana, two startups pursuing unconventional approaches to building AI, worked together to create the new model, called Collective-1.\nFlower created techniques that allow training to be spread across hundreds of computers connected over the internet. The company’s technology is already used by some firms to train AI models without needing to pool compute resources or data. Vana provided sources of data including private messages from X, Reddit, and Telegram.\nCollective-1 is small by modern standards, with 7 billion parameters—values that combine to give the model its abilities—compared to hundreds of billions for today’s most advanced models, such as those that power programs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.\nNic Lane, a computer scientist at the University of Cambridge and cofounder of Flower AI, says that the distributed approach promises to scale far beyond the size of Collective-1. Lane adds that Flower AI is partway through training a model with 30 billion parameters using conventional data and plans to train another model with 100 billion parameters—close to the size offered by industry leaders—later this year. “It could really change the way everyone thinks about AI, so we’re chasing this pretty hard,” Lane says. He says the startup is also incorporating images and audio into training to create multimodal models.\nDistributed model-building could also unsettle the power dynamics that have shaped the AI industry.\nAI companies currently build their models by combining vast amounts of training data with huge quantities of compute concentrated inside data centers stuffed with advanced GPUs that are networked together using superfast fiber-optic cables. They also rely heavily on datasets created by scraping publicly accessible—although sometimes copyrighted—material, including websites and books.\nThe approach means that only the richest companies, and nations with access to large quantities of the most powerful chips, can feasibly develop the most powerful and valuable models. Even open source models, like Meta’s Llama and R1 from DeepSeek, are built by companies with access to large data centers. Distributed approaches could make it possible for smaller companies and universities to build advanced AI by pooling disparate resources together. Or it could allow countries that lack conventional infrastructure to network together several data centers to build a more powerful model.\nLane believes that the AI industry will increasingly look toward new methods that allow training to break out of individual data centers. The distributed approach “allows you to scale compute much more elegantly than the data center model,” he says.\nHelen Toner, an expert on AI governance at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology, says Flower AI’s approach is “interesting and potentially very relevant” to AI competition and governance. “It will probably continue to struggle to keep up with the frontier but could be an interesting fast-follower approach,” Toner says.\nDivide and Conquer\nDistributed AI training involves rethinking the way calculations used to build powerful AI systems are divided up. Creating an LLM involves feeding huge amounts of text into a model that adjusts its parameters in order to produce useful responses to a prompt. Inside a data center the training process is divided up so that parts can be run on different GPUs and then periodically consolidated into a single, master model.\nThe new approach allows the work normally done inside a large data center to be performed on hardware that may be many miles away and connected over a relatively slow or variable internet connection.\nSome big players are also exploring distributed learning. Last year, researchers at Google demonstrated a new scheme for dividing and consolidating computations called DIstributed PAth COmposition (DiPaCo) that enables more efficient distributed learning.\nTo build Collective-1 and other LLMs, Lane and academic collaborators in the UK and China developed a new tool called Photon that makes distributed training more efficient. Photon improves upon Google’s approach, Lane says, with a more efficient approach to representing the data in a model and a more efficient scheme for sharing and consolidating training. The process is slower than conventional training but is more flexible, allowing new hardware to be added to ramp up training, Lane says.\nPhoton was developed in collaboration with researchers at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Zhejiang University in China. The group released the tool under an open source license in March, allowing anyone to make use of the approach.\nFlower AI’s partner in the effort to build Collective-1, Vana, is developing new ways for users to share personal data with AI builders. Vana’s software allows users to contribute private data from platforms like X and Reddit to training a large language model and potentially specify what kind of end uses are permitted, or even benefit financially from their contributions.\nAnna Kazlauskas, cofounder of Vana, says the idea is to make untapped data available for AI training and also to give users more control over how their information is used for AI. “This is data that isn’t usually able to be included in AI models, because it’s not publicly available,” Kazlauskas says, “and is the first time that data directly contributed by users is being used to train a foundation model, with users given ownership of the AI model their data creates.”\nMirco Musolesi, a computer scientist at University College London, says a key benefit of the distributed approach to AI training is likely to be that it unlocks new kinds of data. “Scaling this to frontier models would allow the AI industry to leverage vast amounts of decentralized and privacy-sensitive data, for example in health care and finance, for training without the risks associated with data centralization,” he says.\nWhat do you think of distributed machine learning?

Learn more.\nCold-brew coffee is the gentlest of coffee: pleasant and sweet, made for warm days and chill thoughts. And so the best coffee beans for cold brew are not necessarily the same ones that make the most interesting drip or pour-over or espresso. It's a different animal entirely from the volatile intensity of hot brew. Rather, it's extracted gently over 12 or 24 hours to release the bean's natural sweetness.\nI have my own thoughts, of course. I've tested more than a dozen cold-brew coffee makers in the past year for WIRED's guide to the best cold-brew coffee makers. But few have wrestled with this question more intensely than Maciej Kasperowicz, director of coffee at Trade Coffee, one of WIRED's favorite coffee subscription companies. With his team, Kasperowicz spent months putting together 90 coffees best suited for cold brew, to be included in Trade’s new cold-brew coffee subscription. Meanwhile, Brent Wolczynski, director of product development and cold brew at Portland's Stumptown Coffee, has built one of the most distinguished café and packaged cold-brew programs in the country.\nWe consulted Kasperowicz and Wolczynski to ask about which beans make for great cold-brew coffee, which ones don't, how you know, and the myths surrounding what makes for a good cold-brew cup.\nWhat Is Cold Brew, and What Isn’t It?\nFirst off, when I'm referring to cold brew, I don't necessarily mean all cold coffee. Cold brew is a process: the act of gently extracting coffee at room temperature or lower, over the course of hours instead of minutes. Most “instant” cold-brew makers are actually making something called iced coffee: hot coffee that's quickly chilled to avoid the bad flavors that come from letting coffee cool slowly. It's good but different, and it leads to different results: more aromatics but less smoothness and sweetness.\nOn a traditional cold-brew maker, the process is remarkably simple: Grind beans coarsely, put them in water, leave the mixture out on the counter or in the fridge for 12 to 24 hours, and wait. To make cold-brew concentrate that can then be diluted with water or milk, roll with a ratio of 4 or 5 to 1 by weight. (Ideally, use a kitchen or coffee scale. But 4 ounces of coffee to each pint of water will do.)\nMy favorite home cold-brew coffee maker, combining ease and convenience with excellent extraction and flavor, is the Oxo Compact cold-brew maker. For larger batches, use what restaurants and cafés use: a big ol’ Toddy cold-brew maker ($49). For even more ease and ready-to-drink cold brew at lower concentration, you can try a basket-style brewer like the Hario Mizudashi ($18).\nWhich Beans Make the Best Cold Brew?\nCold brew is a process of extracting flavor over a long time, at low intensity, and so the results differ from hot brew. Gentle extraction means less volatility, less bitterness, and a focus on sweetness and fullness and big, round flavors.\nHere's the best advice from Kasperowicz and Wolczynski on the best coffee beans for the best cold-brew coffee.\nMedium-roast beans have the best balance: The Goldilocks roast level for cold brew is generally a medium-roast level, Kasperowicz says, and that's where you'll find the majority of the coffee bags among Trade’s cold-brew collection. While light roasts offer bright flavors loved in craft coffee, they'll extract a little slower and less easily than a medium roast. “Darker roasts are slightly more soluble, is the theory,” Kasperowicz says, “and so it'll be a little easier for medium and darker roasts.” That said, lighter and medium roasts get more interesting aromatics, so it's a balancing game. “A nicely developed medium roast is the sweet spot for cold brew,” Wolczynski agreed. Neither argues for very dark roasts in cold brew, with Wolczynski in particular saying dark roasts tend to “fall flat.”\nBut lighter roasts can surprise you: “I’ve definitely had cold brew with high floral notes and fruit-forward acidity in African coffees that I’ve absolutely loved,” Wolczynski says. “If you want floral notes and sparkling acidity, Ethiopia Mordecofe ($23) is an African coffee that I’d highly recommend for cold brew … It will be a quenching, juicy cup and best enjoyed black.\" One of the reasons I consulted Wolczynski about cold brew was, in fact, an occasional Stumptown Ethiopian Guji cold brew he first made long ago, which has topped many taste tests over the years.\nMedium or darker for milk drinkers. Light roast only if you like it black: This is just a rule of thumb, but light roasts will be pretty subtle in cold-brew form, and you'll lose them to a blast of milk. Fuller-flavored medium-roast cold brew will be able to hold up better. “If you like a cup that stands up to milk, I’d go with a medium roast from Latin America,” Wolczynski says. “If you drink it black and prefer a brighter, more fruit-forward cup, lighter-roasted African coffees are great.”\nCandy-bar flavors do really well in cold brews: “I think the cold-brew method is particularly good at highlighting sweetness, and high-quality medium-roast coffees tend to lend themselves to tasting notes like chocolate, caramel, etc.,” according to Wolczynski. “Those are also just super well-rounded profiles that can be enjoyed straight or with milk.” Kasperowicz says much the same. Cold brew doesn't always capture delicate aromatics, he says, but can really accentuate big and bold flavors like chocolate and caramel and nuts that are familiar from candy bars. “Coffees that just inherently have those flavors of chocolate—big kind of round bodies, big smooth flavors, lots of sweetness—those kinds of coffees with more kinds of caramelized flavors tend to do better.” Look on the bag of beans, he says, or the description on the roaster's website, for the flavor descriptions of the coffee.\nOrigins can also be a clue to finding these flavors. As a rule of thumb, Latin American coffees tend more toward chocolate, especially, so if you see “Brazil” on the bag it's a good sign. Kasperowicz calls out in particular a Brazilian bag from Atlanta's Portrait called Toni ($38 for 2 pounds)—a great example of a big, full-bodied, nutty, sweet, chocolate roast that does well in cold-brew form. East African roasts tend more often toward fruit and berry notes.\nBalanced blends can offer the best of both worlds: Those big, fruity, bright flavors from single-origin Ethiopian coffees can come out strongly when roasted to medium or paired with chocolatey beans, Kasperowicz says. For Trade's cold-brew program, Kasperowicz selected a Cherry Picker blend ($38 for 2 pounds) of South American and East African beans from Colorado's Boxcar Roasting that tastes like chocolate-covered cherries. A PT's Coffee Roasting Cold Front blend ($38 for 2 pounds) likewise mixes Guatemalan and Ethiopian medium-roast beans to make coffee that tastes like rich, smooth blackberries and caramel. Stumptown offers a seasonal cold-brew blend, but the company's year-round Homestead ($15) offers a balanced brew as well.\nLook on coffee bags for the words “full-bodied” or “rich”: This is a clue to full-flavored cold brew, Kasperowicz says. When coffee roasters describe their coffee as big, full-bodied, or round, this is a sign of a bean that's desperate to give up its secrets and so is more likely to extract fully and richly.\nThink twice before using your most expensive beans: This is more advice for self-preservation. Cold brew requires more coffee beans per cup than drip or pour-over or espresso. Quite simply, you need a lot of course-ground coffee to make a serving size. Depending on how strong you make your cold brew, it may take about 50 percent more than you use for drip coffee. But cold brew is less likely to bring out the delicacy and complexity of that high-altitude, single-origin roast, says Kasperowicz. The resulting cold brew won't be bad. It might be terrific! But you'll get less out of those expensive beans than if you brew them hot. So if you value your pocketbook, look toward blends that have the big flavors that'll come through on a megaphone.\nFresh beans are still and always best: A weird myth going around is that old or stale beans are good for cold brew—perhaps because cold brew might be a little more forgiving of stale beans than hot brew. But fresh beans are best, Kasperowicz says without hesitation. Even though cold brew oxidizes more slowly, because it's cold, it does still take on those stale, cardboardy, sad flavors that come from exposure to oxygen. If you use stale beans, you'll get those flavors faster, and your cold brew will keep for less time in the fridge.\nHow about high altitudes? Are high-altitude beans better for cold brew? Despite claims by some companies, neither Kasperowicz nor Wolczynski think beans grown at high altitude have much to say about what's good for cold brew. Altitude is a sign of quality in general, or of more subtle flavors. But subtlety is not what cold brew is best at accentuating.\nWhat about the best beans for iced coffee? Use whatever coffee you like for drip or espresso, pour it over ice, chill it fast, and you’re there. No new considerations needed, Kasperowicz says. Wolczynski notes that iced coffee has a “tannic” structure that will let it hold up well against milk and ice but finds cold brew more “quenching when drunk black.”",

Gentle extraction means less volatility, less bitterness, and a focus on sweetness and fullness and big, round flavors.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Here's the best advice from Kasperowicz and Wolczynski on the best coffee beans for the best cold-brew coffee.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Medium-roast beans have the best balance:</strong> The Goldilocks roast level for cold brew is generally a medium-roast level, Kasperowicz says, and that's where you'll find the majority of the coffee bags among Trade’s cold-brew collection. While light roasts offer bright flavors loved in craft coffee, they'll extract a little slower and less easily than a medium roast. “Darker roasts are slightly more soluble, is the theory,” Kasperowicz says, “and so it'll be a little easier for medium and darker roasts.” That said, lighter and medium roasts get more interesting aromatics, so it's a balancing game. “A nicely developed medium roast is the sweet spot for cold brew,” Wolczynski agreed. Neither argues for very dark roasts in cold brew, with Wolczynski in particular saying dark roasts tend to “fall flat.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Last week, the US Department of the Interior announced that it would speed up the approval process for certain fossil fuel projects, proclaiming that environmental analyses that previously would have taken years must now be taken down to, at maximum, a month. While the new procedures are seemingly a gift to the industry, this may actually be terrible news for pipeline developers, drillers, and miners.\n“If I were a developer of any of these projects, I would look at this order and smack my forehead,” says Sam Sankar, a senior vice president at Earthjustice, the United States’ biggest environmental nonprofit law organization. “I don’t want my project to be authorized pursuant to these laughable procedures. It won’t hold up in court.”\nThe new procedures use President Donald Trump’s “national energy emergency,” proclaimed in an executive order in the first week of his presidency, to shorten timelines for federal reviews, including environmental reviews and reviews attached to cultural landmarks. Reviews that take into account a project’s impact on the environment are particularly truncated under this new policy. Processes that would normally take a year, the Department of the Interior says, must now be completed within just two weeks, while those reviews that might last longer than a year must now be done in under a month.\nExperts say, however, that the new timelines are so short that they almost certainly run afoul of the bedrock laws involved: the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. Mass ongoing layoffs inside the federal government—including at Interior, where The Washington Post reported that a quarter of the agency’s staff may eventually be cut—means that there may soon be far too few staff to handle reviews that would be near impossible to fulfill even in normal circumstances. This leaves any projects that try to break ground under the new timelines open to very easy legal challenges—something that Sankar says is “low-hanging fruit” for people who are impacted by a project and who want to take a developer to court.\n“The people who wrote NEPA and the Endangered Species Act meant for the public to be involved, meant for real expertise to be applied, and meant for these to be meaningful ways to protect the environment and biodiversity,” Sankar says. “To shorten these periods to where you can barely get a letter from point A to point B in that time means that they’re not trying to comply at all. The good news is that it’s all so manifestly illegal that virtually anything they do under these new legal procedures will be ripe for a legal challenge.”\nThese fast-forwarded processes are tied to a part of NEPA that states that agencies can bypass environmental reviews in case of an emergency. Ryan Hathaway, who worked on NEPA-related issues within Interior for more than a decade, says that this emergency justification has been used in the past for concrete events that pose an immediate threat to health and public safety, like wildfires or floods, with specific actions that needed to be taken—rather than a vague and open-ended energy “emergency.”\n“Lawyers are going to have a field day with this,” says Hathaway, who now works as a director at Lawyers for Good Government, a legal nonprofit dedicated to progressive advocacy.\nIt’s clear these new rules are exclusively a gift to extractive industries like drilling and mining. Solar and wind projects—which the administration has repeatedly attacked, withdrawing leases for offshore wind and ordering a construction halt on projects already underway—are notably absent from the list of projects allowed to undergo accelerated timelines. But ironically, these orders are only contributing to an increasingly uncertain environment for fossil fuel producers under the new Trump administration.\nEven before the chaos caused by Liberation Day, Big Oil faced a potential reckoning with the president it helped elect. While the shale oil boom of the early 2010s rewarded executives for increased production, that strategy led to too much supply, leading prices per barrel to drop during the first Trump administration. After prices bottomed out during the pandemic, investors became more careful about unrestrained production.\n“It’s not government regulation that’s limiting the production growth rate in the United States. It’s Wall Street,” says Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank based in Washington, DC.\nThe industry was given a boost in the early 2020s with the worldwide energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but investors kept a cautious eye on prices. Despite President Joe Biden’s climate focus, the US oil and gas industry became the world’s biggest crude oil producer in 2023, and reached a record high of producing 13.4 million barrels per day late last year. The challenge under the Trump administration would become balancing profitability with the president’s goal of unleashing “energy dominance.” Trump, after all, has stated that he wants oil to drop to $50 a barrel—a price far too low to be profitable for the industry.\nEach quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas publishes a regional report on the state of the oil and gas industry in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico, which includes anonymous survey responses from executives. The vitriol towards the White House in these comments from the first survey of this year, published in late March, shocked analysts.\n“The key word to describe 2025 so far is ‘uncertainty’ and as a public company, our investors hate uncertainty,” one anonymous executive said. “This uncertainty is being caused by the conflicting messages coming from the new administration. There cannot be ‘US energy dominance’ and $50 per barrel oil; those two statements are contradictory.”\n\"’Drill, baby, drill’ is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry,” another wrote.\nTrump has continued to hand out questionable gifts to industry. On Thursday, Interior announced that it had changed some policies around offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico that could, according to the agency, increase production in the Gulf by up to 100,000 barrels a day. Meanwhile, Interior is also reportedly assembling a list of fossil fuel deposits on public lands that it plans to open up for production.\nLike the accelerated timelines for environmental permitting, these gifts come with significant strings attached. While the Gulf order will help companies currently producing to up their productivity, they’re unlikely to lure new customers to the region: Offshore drilling is expensive, and four-fifths of the more than 2,000 active leases in the Gulf are sitting unused.\nAnd while opening up public lands to drilling may sound like an industry wish-list item, companies faced with an uncertain American regulatory environment—from the looming threat of tariffs, to accelerated permitting timelines that could get projects held up in court, to promises made under a Republican administration that may be withdrawn the next time a Democrat is president—may not want to invest years and capital in starting up a project in a risky area.\n“For more than a century, energy companies have looked at projects in part based on the host country’s political risk, but the United States wasn’t on that list,” Seigle says. “These days we see huge swings in political support for oil and gas, and the trend of reversing the prior administration's approach. So energy companies and their investors are now thinking about the political risk of energy projects right here at home.”",

    "content_text": "The end-to-end encrypted communication app WhatsApp, used by roughly 3 billion people around the world, will roll out cloud-based AI capabilities in the coming weeks that are designed to preserve WhatsApp’s defining security and privacy guarantees while offering users access to message summarization and composition tools.\nMeta has been incorporating generative AI features across its services that are built on its open source large language model, Llama. And WhatsApp already incorporates a light blue circle that gives users access to the Meta AI assistant. But many users have balked at this addition, given that interactions with the AI assistant aren’t shielded from Meta the way end-to-end encrypted WhatsApp chats are. The new feature, dubbed Private Processing, is meant to address these concerns with what the company says is a carefully architected and purpose-built platform devoted to processing data for AI tasks without the information being accessible to Meta, WhatsApp, or any other party. While initial reviews by researchers of the scheme’s integrity have been positive, some note that the move toward AI features could ultimately put WhatsApp on a slippery slope.\n“WhatsApp is targeted and looked at by lots of different researchers and threat actors. That means internally it has a well understood threat model,” says Meta security engineering director Chris Rohlf. “There's also an existing set of privacy expectations from users, so this wasn’t just about managing the expansion of that threat model and making sure the expectations for privacy and security were met—it was about careful consideration of the user experience and making this opt-in.”\nEnd-to-end encrypted communications are only accessible to the sender and receiver, or the people in a group chat. The service provider, in this case WhatsApp and its parent company Meta, is boxed out by design and can’t access users’ messages or calls. This setup is incompatible with typical generative AI platforms that run large language models on cloud servers and need access to users’ requests and data for processing. The goal of Private Processing is to create an alternate framework through which the privacy and security guarantees of end-to-end encrypted communication can be upheld while incorporating AI.\nUsers opt into using WhatsApp’s AI features, and they can also prevent people they’re chatting with from using the AI features in shared communications by turning on a new WhatsApp control known as “Advanced Chat Privacy.”\n“When the setting is on, you can block others from exporting chats, auto-downloading media to their phone, and using messages for AI features,” WhatsApp wrote in a blog post last week. Like disappearing messages, anyone in a chat can turn Advanced Chat Privacy on and off—which is recorded for all to see—so participants just need to be mindful of any adjustments.\nPrivate Processing is built with special hardware that isolates sensitive data in a “Trusted Execution Environment,” a siloed, locked-down region of a processor. The system is built to process and retain data for the minimum amount of time possible and is designed grind to a halt and send alerts if it detects any tampering or adjustments. WhatsApp is already inviting third-party audits of different components of the system and will make it part of the Meta bug bounty program to encourage the security community to submit information about flaws and potential vulnerabilities. Meta also says that, ultimately, it plans to make the components of Private Processing open source, both for expanded verification of its security and privacy guarantees and to make it easier for others to build similar services.\nLast year, Apple debuted a similar scheme, known as Private Cloud Compute, for its Apple Intelligence AI platform. And users can turn the service on in Apple’s end-to-end encrypted communication app, Messages, to generate message summaries and compose “Smart Reply” messages on both iPhones and Macs.\nLooking at Private Cloud Compute and Private Processing side by side is like comparing, well, Apple(s) and oranges, though. Apple’s Private Cloud Compute underpins all of Apple Intelligence everywhere it can be applied. Private Processing, on the other hand, was purpose-built for WhatsApp and doesn’t underpin Meta’s AI features more broadly. Apple Intelligence is also designed to do as much AI processing as possible on-device and only send requests to the Private Cloud Compute infrastructure when necessary. Since such “on device” or “local” processing requires powerful hardware, Apple only designed Apple Intelligence to run at all on its recent generations of mobile hardware. Old iPhones and iPads will never support Apple Intelligence.\nApple is a manufacturer of high-end smartphones and other hardware, while Meta is a software company, and has about 3 billion users who have all types of smartphones, including old and low-end devices. Rohlf and Colin Clemmons, one of the Private Processing lead engineers, say that it wasn’t feasible to design AI features for WhatsApp that could run locally on the spectrum of devices WhatsApp serves. Instead, WhatsApp focused on designing Private Processing to be as unhelpful as possible to attackers if it were to be breached.\n“The design is one of risk minimization,” Clemmons says. “We want to minimize the value of compromising the system.”\nThe whole effort raises a more basic question, though, about why a secure communication platform like WhatsApp needs to offer AI features at all. Meta is adamant, though, that users expect the features at this point and will go wherever they have to to get them.\n“Many people want to use AI tools to help them when they are messaging,” WhatsApp head Will Cathcart told WIRED in an email. “We think building a private way to do that is important, because people shouldn’t have to switch to a less-private platform to have the functionality they need.”\n“Any end-to-end encrypted system that uses off-device AI inference is going to be riskier than a pure end to end system. You’re sending data to a computer in a data center, and that machine sees your private texts,” says Matt Green, a Johns Hopkins cryptographer who previewed some of the privacy guarantees of Private Processing, but hasn’t audited the complete system. “I believe WhatsApp when they say that they’ve designed this to be as secure as possible, and I believe them when they say that they can’t read your texts. But I also think there are risks here. More private data will go off device, and the machines that process this data will be a target for hackers and nation state adversaries.”\nWhatsApp says, too, that beyond basic AI features like text summarization and writing suggestions, Private Processing will hopefully create a foundation for expanding into more complicated and involved AI features in the future that involve processing, and potentially storing, more data.\nAs Green puts it, “Given all the crazy things people use secure messengers for, any and all of this will make the Private Processing computers into a very big target.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nA chocolate Box is not a substitute for true love. But sometimes it's close enough. And as aphrodisiacs go, it's a whole lot prettier than oysters. Procuring the most exquisite chocolate once required dedicated travel or a vision quest, but these days the country's best chocolate can be sent to your doorstep within days.\nSometimes, only the best will do. We've tasted dozens of the finest chocolate boxes available anywhere in the United States and convened a panel of chocolate experts and dedicated enthusiasts—some might say, obsessives—to find the very finest boxes of delivery chocolate for every need and every palate.\nBut note that much of the best chocolate can be fragile, susceptible to both time and temperature. Most we recommend are as fresh as they come, available only from the chocolate sellers themselves, shipped on expedited schedules and made within days of shipping to ensure freshness. Each is best stored in cool temperatures and eaten within a week of arrival.\nFrom stalwarts of French tradition and the purest single-origin chocolate to impossibly textured bonbons and true mavericks of cacao, here are our favorite delivery chocolate boxes in the country.\nWould you like to send or receive more treats in the mail? Check out our guides to the best meal kit delivery services, the best coffee subscriptions, the meat subscription boxes, and the best gift subscription boxes of all kinds.\nUpdated April 2025: We've added the Richart Initiation and La Maison Du Chocolat Light and Dark chocolate boxes, and updated prices and descriptions throughout, removing items that were no longer available.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nWho Are the Tasting Panel?\nOur initial tasting panel in January 2025 consisted of four tasters with long experience in the food world as critics, chocolate experts, chocolate festival or tasting organizers, and specialty purveyors. We included no chocolate makers or distributors, to rule out conflicts of interest. Matthew Korfhage conducted a second, smaller tasting of French chocolates in April. Here are the panelists from the initial January panel.\nMatthew Korfhage, who organized the tasting, is a writer and reviewer for WIRED with more than a decade’s experience as a food critic and food writer on both coasts and a long habit of sourcing bean-to-bar chocolate at the country's most renowned stores, as well as reporting on the occasional chocolate scandal or German chocolate club trend.\nFrench-born Estelle Tracy is one of few who can credibly claim the title of “chocolate sommelier,” a Philadelphia-area writer and consultant on all matters chocolate and founder of the Brandywine Chocolate Society. She has hosted hundreds of chocolate tastings, both online and in person, and specializes in pairing wine and chocolate.\nBarb Genuario is a founder of the Midwest Craft Chocolate Festival, a trained chocolate judge, and a consultant to other chocolate festivals. She is also cofounder of the DC Chocolate Society and is a globe-crossing chocolate lover who documents her chocolate-related travels online.\nJessie Mooberry is a proprietress of farm-to-table café and bakery Farmer & Co. west of Philadelphia, where she retails specialty goods that include chocolate and regularly provides space for chocolate tastings—including WIRED’s January tasting panel.\nOther Delivery Chocolate Boxes We Enjoyed\nUzma Chocolat's Signature Exotic Box for $49: Hailing from Chicago, this was one of a few to arrive after the date for our January tasting panel—and so couldn't be included in our top picks. But among the latecomers, it was a contender: an enrobed box filled with intense but balanced South Asian flavors, and a rare chocolate box to advertise itself as halal. A ginger bonbon skewed a little intense, but a date-plum “khajoor” was a quiet riot of texture and flavor, and the tea flavors of lapsang and assam provided lovely and delicate accents.\nLily & Sparrow's Bonbons for $45: At less than a year old, North Jersey's tiny Lily & Sparrow was a strong favorite of a couple members of the January tasting panel. Chocolatier Amanda Sanabria has a wonderful gift, in particular, at crafting intense bursts of fruit flavor in bonbons that included passionfruit and lemon pistachio. While not quite as complex as similar bonbons from Melissa Coppel or Kreuther, Lily's mastery of fruit filling puts it on a very short list. “Verdict is: This is one chocolatier to watch,” wrote one taster after the panel.\nAndSons 24-Piece Chocolate Box for $75: As befits a legacy Beverly Hills chocolatier, this is a beautifully packaged box, a mix of glossy bonbons and chocolate-enrobed squares. The molded bonbons made the biggest impression, whether a bright passionfruit, orange, and guava or a rich speculoos patterned after a gingerbread biscuit. The box didn't grab me by the lapels and demand to be remembered, but I'd be happy anytime to receive it: It's a lovely and accomplished box, absent flaws and off notes. Note that we appreciated AndSons' bonbons even more as part of a Coffee and Chocolate Set ($109) from Atlas Coffee Club: Each chocolate, and each coffee [paired with it, tasted extravagantly richer when together than apart.\nUnited Flavors 24-Piece Chocolatier's Selection for $89: This was another late arrival, and so it missed assessment by our full tasting panel. But this tiny and quite new Virginia chocolatier kept cropping back up in my thoughts, especially for an immaculately fluffy vanilla soufflé square with texture somewhere between sea-foam and cloud: There's little like it. Molded bonbons were also lovely and deft, if not quite up to the subtle complexity of Melissa Coppel or the trompe-la-langue lulz of Kreuther.\nEclat 16-Piece Signature Assortment for $48: A favorite of Anthony Bourdain and Eric Ripert, Eclat is a Pennsylvania brand with a wide and inventive selection of treats that include Frank Lloyd Wright–themed chocolate bars and wafer-thin chocolate \"Mondiants\" of chocolatier Christopher Curtin's own invention. This said, the box we preferred most was the simple enrobed squares and spheres of the signature assortment, prone to culinary flavors such as Sichuan or Aleppo pepper, or the light gush of beer or booze.\nBoxes We Don’t Recommend\nCompartés' 20-Piece Signature Truffles Gift Box for $59: Compartés is best known for its wackily creative candy bars, which may contain the tastes and flavors of doughnuts and coffee, a perfect s'more, or a whole cereal aisle—a popularity that's been cosigned by a Vanity Fair party's worth of celebrities. Their handsomely packaged truffles didn't make the same impression.\nForté’s 24-piece Signature Truffles for $110 and Exquisito's 24-Piece Artisan Collection: Washington State's Forté and Florida’s Exquisito both come highly praised. Both boxes, alas, arrived at our doorstep in less-than-ideal condition. It's unknown whether problems arose during shipping or at the chocolate company.\nCreo 24-Piece Signature Chocolate Collection for $84: Look, I love Creo's inventive and lovely white or dark chocolate bars encrusted with thin wafers of dried strawberry or raspberry, which offer a terrific contrast of rich flavor and bright fruit. But the Portland maker's signature box of mostly enrobed chocolate truffles didn't always seem in control of its flavors and textures—a fatal flaw in a premium-priced collection.",

It’s currently developing a small test reactor, named after Taylor’s great-grandfather. But the company says that overly onerous regulations imposed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the country’s main regulatory body for nuclear reactors, has forced Valar Atomics to develop its test reactor overseas.\nIn early April, Valar Atomics, in addition to another nuclear startup, Deep Fission, as well as the states of Florida, Louisiana, and Arizona’s state legislature, signed onto a lawsuit against the NRC. The lawsuit, originally filed in December by Texas, Utah, and nuclear company Last Energy, blames the NRC for “so restrictively regulat[ing] new nuclear reactor construction that it rarely happens at all.”\nThe US has historically been the global powerhouse of nuclear energy, yet only three reactors have come online over the past 25 years, all behind schedule and with ballooning budgets. Meanwhile, other countries, like China and South Korea, have raced ahead with construction of reactors of all sizes. Some nuclear advocates say that the US’s regulation system, which imposes cumbersome requirements and ultra-long timelines on projects, is largely to blame for this delay—especially when it comes to developing new designs for smaller reactors—and that some reactors should be taken from the NRC’s purview altogether. But others have concerns about potential attempts to bypass the country’s nuclear regulations for specific designs.\nThe NRC has long been criticized for its ultra-slow permitting times, inefficient processes, and contentious back-and-forth with nuclear companies. “The regulatory relationship in the US has been described as legalistic and adversarial for nuclear,” says Nick Touran, a licensed nuclear engineer who runs the website What Is Nuclear. “That is kind of uniquely American. In other countries, like France and China, the regulators are more cooperative.”\nThe lawsuit takes these criticisms one step further, claiming that by regulating smaller reactors, the NRC is misreading a crucial piece of nuclear legislation. In 1954, Congress passed the Atomic Energy Act, which created modern nuclear regulation in the US. That law mandated regulations for nuclear facilities that used nuclear material “in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security” or that use it “in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public.”\n“We would love the NRC to respect the law that was written,” says Taylor, who believes the reactor his company is working on sits outside of that mandate. “What it would do for us is to allow innovation to happen again. Innovation is what drives the American economy.”\n“The NRC will address the litigation, as necessary, in its court filings,” agency spokesperson Scott Burnell told WIRED in an email.\nWhile we generally think of nuclear reactors as huge power plants, reactors can be made much smaller: Models known as small modular reactors, or SMRs, usually produce a third of the energy of a larger reactor, while even smaller reactors known as microreactors are designed small enough to be hauled by semitruck. Because of their size, these reactors are inherently less dangerous than their large counterparts. There’s simply not enough power in an SMR for a Three Mile Island–style meltdown.\nThe lawsuit argues that by mandating a cumbersome licensing process for all types of reactors—including those that are safer because of their size—the NRC is both violating the Atomic Energy Act and stifling progress. A company called NuScale, the only SMR company to get NRC approval for its model, spent $500 million and 2 million hours of labor over several years just to get its design approved. In late 2023 it pulled the plug on a planned power plant in Idaho after customers balked at the projected high price tag for power, which soared from an estimated $58 per megawatt-hour in 2021 to $89 per megawatt-hour in 2023.\nThe lawsuit comes at a unique time for nuclear power. Public sentiment around nuclear energy is the highest it’s been in 15 years. Dozens of new nuclear startups have cropped up in recent years, each promising to revolutionize the American nuclear industry—and serve power-hungry industries like data centers and oil and gas. Private equity and venture capital invested more than $783 million in nuclear startups in 2024, doing twice the number of deals in the sector as they did in 2023.\nThe lawsuit “is about getting steel in the ground. This is about getting nuclear on the grid,” says Chris Koopman, the CEO of the Abundance Institute, a nonprofit focused on encouraging the development and deployment of new technology. The Institute, which was founded last year, has no standing in the lawsuit and does not represent any plaintiffs but has served as a “thought partner,” per Koopman, who coauthored an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal in January announcing the lawsuit.\nDeep Fission, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, seeks to generate electricity using small modular reactors placed a mile underground—a model its CEO, Liz Muller, says is both safer and cheaper than traditional construction. Even though Deep Fission is a party in the lawsuit, the company has also begun pre-licensing its design with the NRC. Muller sees the lawsuit as bringing a new approach to the agency regarding SMRs: helping it to develop “a regulatory sandbox, where we’re allowed to explore approaches to regulations while we’re moving forward at the same time.”\nThe lawsuit posits that individual states “are more than capable of regulating” smaller reactors. Thirty-nine states are already licensed by the NRC to handle and inspect nuclear material, while Koopman points out that the states involved in the lawsuit have recently passed legislation to speed the construction of nuclear projects in-state. “All of the states involved in the case have already entered into agreement with the NRC, in which the NRC has recognized that they know their stuff,” he says.\nTaylor believes allowing states to compete on regulation would help boost safety within the field of small modular reactors. “Innovation is what drives the safety ball down the field, and the only way to do that is to have different regulators with different ideas,” he says. “That’s federalism 101.”\nAdam Stein, the director of the Nuclear Energy Innovation program at the Breakthrough Institute, an eco-modernist policy center, sees some serious flaws with this approach. He says that while some states, like Texas, may have the resources and the knowledge to create their own effective regulatory body, other states may struggle. Stein likens a patchwork of different regulations as being akin to car seat laws, where the age of the child required to be in a car seat varies across states, making it tough for a parent to plan a road trip.\n“Some states are less consistent in applying safety standards than others,” he says. “Some states would prefer their standards to be stricter than national standards. Some states have reduced safety standards from nationally recommended standards.”\nMuller says she understands these concerns. “There is a risk if we get wildly different regulatory processes, that would not be a great result,” she says. “But I think there’s also an opportunity for states to move forward and then for other states to piggyback on what has been developed by the earlier adopter.”\nStein also foresees a possibility for continued red tape, as even with state-level regulation, the NRC would still be forced to review individual reactor designs to see if they were safe enough to pass off for state review. “A developer couldn’t just assert that their design is so safe, that it’s below the line,” he says. “It’s still going to have to go through a review to determine whether the NRC should review it.”\nJust because a nuclear reactor can’t cause massive damage to big populations doesn’t necessarily mean it’s fail-safe. The only deadly nuclear accident on US soil occurred at a tiny reactor in Idaho, which killed its three operators in the early 1960s. Designs for small reactors have made leaps and bounds in safety since then—a development Touran says is thanks in part to regulations from the federal government.\n“I believe a well-designed small reactor, subject to reasonable nuclear design standards based on years of lessons learned, would be very safe,” says Touran. “I do not believe that this means anyone should be able to go out and build a small reactor with minimal oversight.”\nThere have been efforts in recent years to speed up the NRC’s permitting process. In 2019, during his first term, President Donald Trump signed the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act; among its many reforms, it mandated that the NRC shift around key licensing processes and create a new process for licensing smaller, more technologically varied reactors. Last year, President Joe Biden signed the ADVANCE Act, which made even more changes to the NRC process; both of these pieces of legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n“At this point, the NRC says pretty willingly that they’re working hard to be more efficient, that they understand they need to be more efficient, that they have been more efficient with recent licensing applications,” says Klein.\nFor developers like Taylor, this progress is too little, too late. “Do we really want China and Russia to be the global nuclear developers for the world?” he says. “I don’t. I would like the United States to be the nuclear developer of the world.”\nPermitting reform alone, especially in the SMR space, may not solve the issue of competing with other world powers. Nuclear energy might be overregulated, but it is also expensive to build, even for smaller reactors, requiring big up-front investments and a large amount of labor. NuScale did lose valuable time and money on a cumbersome regulatory process—but its energy was also competing in price against gas and renewables, which are, on average, cheaper than nuclear power from plants that have been running for decades.\nAfter decades of battling public fear of nuclear plants, nuclear acceptance has reached a pivotal moment. When compared to the massive health toll from fossil fuels, which research shows are responsible for 1 in 5 deaths around the world, nuclear power is exorbitantly safe. But there’s a sense from some advocates that some of the hard-won trust nuclear energy now has from the public—supported by decades of careful regulation—is in danger if the movement becomes too cavalier about safety.\nWhen Valar announced it would join the lawsuit, Taylor published a blog post on the company’s website that claimed that the company’s reactor was so safe that someone could hold the spent fuel in their hands for five minutes and get as much radiation exposure as a CAT scan. Touran questioned this claim, leading Taylor to post the numbers behind the company’s analysis on X. Another nuclear engineer ran his own calculation using these inputs, finding that holding fuel under the conditions provided by Valar would give a “lethal dose” of radiation in 85 milliseconds. (Taylor told WIRED that Valar is working on a “thorough analysis” in response that will be public in a few weeks and that the initial claims around the spent fuel were simply “a thought experiment we did for our own internal illustration purposes” and not part of the lawsuit materials.)\n“We’ve operated reactors so well for so long that a whole new breed of advocates and even founders mistakenly believe that they’re fail-safe by default,” says Touran. “The reality is they’re made fail-safe by very careful and well-regulated engineering and quality assurance.”",

    "content_text": "Apple’s AirPlay feature enables iPhones and Macbooks to seamlessly play music or show photos and videos on other Apple devices or third-party speakers and TVs that integrate the protocol. Now newly uncovered security flaws in AirPlay mean that those same wireless connections could allow hackers to move within a network just as easily, spreading malicious code from one infected device to another. Apple products are known for regularly receiving fixes, but given how rarely some smart-home devices are patched, it’s likely that these wirelessly enabled footholds for malware, across many of the hundreds of models of AirPlay-enabled devices, will persist for years to come.\nOn Tuesday, researchers from the cybersecurity firm Oligo revealed what they’re calling AirBorne, a collection of vulnerabilities affecting AirPlay, Apple’s proprietary radio-based protocol for local wireless communication. Bugs in Apple’s AirPlay software development kit (SDK) for third-party devices would allow hackers to hijack gadgets like speakers, receivers, set-top boxes, or smart TVs if they’re on the same Wi-Fi network as the hacker’s machine. Another set of AirBorne vulnerabilities would have allowed hackers to exploit AirPlay-enabled Apple devices too, Apple told Oligo, though these bugs have been patched in updates over the last several months, and Apple tells WIRED that those bugs could have only been exploited when users changed default AirPlay settings.\nThose Apple devices aside, Oligo’s chief technology officer and cofounder, Gal Elbaz, estimates that potentially vulnerable third-party AirPlay-enabled devices number in the tens of millions. “Because AirPlay is supported in such a wide variety of devices, there are a lot that will take years to patch—or they will never be patched,” Elbaz says. “And it's all because of vulnerabilities in one piece of software that affects everything.”\nDespite Oligo working with Apple for months to patch the AirBorne bugs in all affected devices, the Tel-Aviv-based security firm warns that the AirBorne vulnerabilities in many third-party gadgets are likely to remain hackable unless users act to update them. If a hacker can get onto the same Wi-Fi network as those vulnerable devices—whether by hacking into another computer on a home or corporate network or by simply connecting to the same coffeeshop or airport Wi-Fi—they can surreptitiously take over these gadgets. From there, they could use this control to maintain a stealthy point of access, hack other targets on the network, or add the machines to a botnet of infected, coordinated machines under the hacker’s control.\nOligo also notes that many of the vulnerable devices have microphones and could be turned into listening devices for espionage. The researchers did not go so far as to create proof-of-concept malware for any particular target that would demonstrate that trick.\nOligo says it warned Apple about its AirBorne findings in the late fall and winter of last year, and Apple responded in the months since then by pushing out security updates. The researchers collaborated with Apple to test and validate the fixes for Macs and other Apple products.\nApple tells WIRED that it has also created patches that are available for impacted third-party devices. The company emphasizes, though, that there are limitations to the attacks that would be possible on AirPlay-enabled devices as a result of the bugs, because an attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as a target to exploit them. Apple adds that while there is potentially some user data on devices like TVs and speakers, it is typically very limited.\nBelow is a video of the Oligo researchers demonstrating their AirBorne hacking technique to take over an AirPlay-enabled Bose speaker to show their company’s logo for AirBorne. (The researchers say they didn’t intend to single out Bose, but just happened to have one of the company’s speakers on hand for testing.) Bose did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment.\nThe AirBorne vulnerabilities Oligo found also affect CarPlay, the radio protocol used to connect to vehicles’ dashboard interfaces. Oligo warns that this means hackers could hijack a car’s automotive computer, known as its head unit, in any of more than 800 CarPlay-enabled car and truck models. In those car-specific cases, though, the AirBorne vulnerabilities could only be exploited if the hacker is able to pair their own device with the head unit via Bluetooth or a USB connection, which drastically restricts the threat of CarPlay-based vehicle hacking.\nThe AirPlay SDK flaws in home media devices, by contrast, may present a more practical vulnerability for hackers seeking to hide on a network, whether to install ransomware or carry out stealthy espionage, all while hiding on devices that are often forgotten by both consumers and corporate or government network defenders. “The amount of devices that were vulnerable to these issues, that's what alarms me,” says Oligo researcher Uri Katz. “When was the last time you updated your speaker?”\nThe researchers originally started thinking about this property of AirPlay, and ultimately discovered the AirBorne vulnerabilities, while working on a different project analyzing vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to access internal services running on a target’s local network from a malicious website. In that earlier research, Oligo’s hackers found they could defeat the fundamental protections baked into every web browser that are meant to prevent websites from having this type of invasive access on other people’s internal networks.\nWhile playing around with their discovery, the researchers realized that one of the services they could access by exploiting the bugs without authorization on a target’s systems was AirPlay. The crop of AirBorne vulnerabilities revealed today is unconnected to the previous work, but was inspired by AirPlay’s properties as a service built to sit open and at the ready for new connections.\nAnd the fact that the researchers found flaws in the AirPlay SDK means that vulnerabilities are lurking in hundreds of models of devices—and possibly more, given that some manufacturers incorporate the AirPlay SDK without notifying Apple and becoming “certified” AirPlay devices.\n“When third-party manufacturers integrate Apple technologies like AirPlay via an SDK, obviously Apple no longer has direct control over the hardware or the patching process,” says Patrick Wardle, CEO of the Apple device-focused security firm DoubleYou. “As a result, when vulnerabilities arise and third-party vendors fail to update their products promptly—or at all—it not only puts users at risk but could also erode trust in the broader Apple ecosystem.\"\nUpdated 10 am ET, April 29, 2024: Clarified that the logo in Oligo's video is for AirBorne, not the company itself.",

Subscribe Today.\nBest Overall\nEberjey\nGisele Tencel Modal Slouchy PJ Set\nThe Eberjey Gisele Slouchy PJ Set is made from a featherlight Tencel modal blend that puddles in all the right places. The scooped boatneck, drop shoulders, and slim sleeves channel just a hint of 2006-era loungewear (minus the rhinestones). The low-rise, jogger-style bottoms have elasticized ankle cuffs that offer just enough structure without overpowering the slouchy silhouette. The color palette is grown-up and lovely, with shades like cabernet, navy, and sun-kissed coral.\nBoth the pajama top and bottoms feature oversized adjustable ties, which some online reviewers found to be fussy, but I think they're charming—like something you’d wear to journal in a canopy bed. These PJs run loose already, so stick with your normal size. I made the mistake of sizing up and ended up with long pants that were too big. The ankle cuffs can ride up when you’re sleeping or sprawled out on the couch, but a quick adjustment will keep them in place. It’s a minor inconvenience in an otherwise luxurious sleep set.\nMaterial: 95 percent Tencel modal, 5 percent Spandex.\nSizes: XS through XL.\nCare Instructions: Machine wash cold; tumble dry low.\nBest Bamboo\nCozy Earth\nWomen's Bamboo Stretch-Knit Long Sleeve Pajama Set\nThese are my favorite PJs right now. Cozy Earth’s Women's Bamboo Stretch-Knit Long Sleeve Pajama Set is made from bamboo viscose, which is a knit blend that is cooler and more breathable than cotton. This is what I put on when I want to feel my body settle into comfort. It makes me want to use my LED mask, read the author’s note of my book, and sip sleepy girl mocktails until I pass out.\nCozy Earth recommends sizing down if you’re in between sizes, but I prefer a roomier fit, so I sized up and was not disappointed. The bottoms also run short, so if you’re over 5’7”, I’d suggest the tall inseam. The brand rotates in new colors and prints every season; you can’t go wrong with any of them, but note that the lighter colors (like ivory) can be a bit sheer. The pajama set also takes forever to dry. I run a gentle cycle, followed by a second tumble or hang-dry. Still, it’s worth the effort.\nMaterial: 95 percent premium viscose from bamboo, 5 percent Spandex.\nSizes: XXS through XXXL.\nCare Instructions: Machine wash cold with normal detergent. Do not use fabric softener or bleach. Machine dry normally.\nBest Cotton\nLake Pajamas\nPima Long-Long Set in Hydrangea\nIf you’ve ever wished your sleepwear had the soul of a Nancy Meyers film, Lake Pajamas will make you look like a coastal grandmother on an artist retreat. Think: watercolor florals, nautical stripes, and botanical prints. The three-quarter sleeve scoop-neck top and pant set are made from 100 percent Peruvian Pima cotton, which is soft, airy, and cool on the skin. It’s ideal for hot sleepers or those prone to night sweats. They’re not cheap, but they’re the kind of classic pajamas you’ll wear year-round.\nLake’s Pima cotton does shrink a bit after the first wash (mostly in length), so if you’re between sizes, take the brand’s advice and size up. I went up to a large and still found myself wishing I’d gone bigger for a roomier fit. The pajama pants come in three lengths—cropped (26”), regular (29”), and tall (32”).\nMaterial: 100 percent Pima cotton.\nSizes: XXS through XXL.\nCare Instructions: Machine wash cold water. Use a mild soap on delicate cycle. Never use chlorine bleach or Oxiclean. Lay flat to dry.\nBest Organic Cotton\nBoll & Branch\nSoft Knit Long Sleeve & Pants Pajama Set\nThese are the pajamas I imagine they hand out at wellness retreats, right after they take away your phone and offer you a cold-pressed green juice. It’s made from 100 percent organic cotton (see certifications here) and enzyme-washed, so it feels soft and stretchy from the first wear. The fabric is also preshrunk. The long-sleeve button-down is designed with ruched shoulders, a high-low hem, and a notch collar that make me feel like a distinguished gentlewoman. The relaxed pants are high-rise with a flat, elasticized waistband that doesn’t dig in. If you’re in between sizes, go up one because the set will naturally shrink a bit after the first wash, but nothing tragic.\nMaterial: 100 percent organic cotton.\nSizes: XS through XXL.\nCare Instructions: Machine wash cold with like colors, inside out on gentle cycle. Tumble dry on low.\nBest Thermoregulating Sleepwear\nDagsmejan\nNattwell Sleep Tech Long Sleeve Loose Fit Top & Pants\nI run hot, thanks to a cocktail of caffeine, overstimulation, and good old-fashioned anxiety. Many brands claim to sell sweat-wicking sleepwear, but Dagsmejan is one of the few I’ve tested that deliver on its promises. The magic is in the Nattwell tech fabric—95 percent MicroModal spun from sustainable beechwood—that’s engineered with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. It somehow pulls sweat away from my skin and keeps me from overheating. According to the brand, it is six times more breathable than cotton, two times softer, and four times better at wicking moisture. I can’t verify the math, but I can tell you I wake up bone dry and that these are the softest PJs I own. Plus, there are no scratchy seams or tags, and the loose fit feels like butter.\nMaterial: 90 percent modal, 10 percent spandex.\nSizes: XXS through XXL.\nCare Instructions: Machine wash cold; tumble dry low.\nBest Value\nPetite Plume\nWomen's Pima Short Sleeve Short Set in Cherry Orchard\nThis Petite Plume set is what I imagine a young Blair Waldorf changes into after peeling off her mulberry silk lingerie and kicking Chuck Bass out for the zillionth time. It’s a cropped riff on the classic long PJs, with a short-sleeve button-down and loose mid-thigh shorts. I love the Cherry Orchard print, but it’s also available in a blue Bristol Bay pattern and leafy Palmier design. The Pima cotton fabric is yarn-dyed, so the refined piping and vibrant colors survive the laundry cycle. It’s also preshrunk, but expect to lose about 3 to 5 percent after the first couple of washes. You can even get the shirt’s pocket monogrammed for $20, which feels snooty in the best way.\nMaterial: 100 percent Peruvian Pima cotton.\nSizes: XS through XL.\nCare Instructions: Machine wash cold with like colors. Machine dry without heat.\nBest Splurge\nLa Ligne NYC\nBonne Nuit Shorty Pajamas\nIf you’ve ever wanted to feel like you’ve just stepped off a French terrace, these cotton pajamas are as close as you can get without leaving your apartment. Designed from the same high-quality fabric as La Ligne’s bestseller, these shorties are comfy, crisp, and just feel like you should be sipping un café au lait in Paris. The white piping along the collar, cuffs, and waistband adds an elegant touch to an otherwise effortless design.\nMade from 100 percent cotton, the button-down, short-sleeve shirt and elasticated shorts don’t have much stretch to them, and the sizing is restrictive, with the largest size only going up to XL. Size up if you’re on the fence about the fit. I ordered an XL, expecting an oversized fit, but found it true to size. Any snugger, and my skin would have no room to breathe. They are expensive but cheaper than a round trip to Europe.\nMaterial: 100 percent cotton.\nSizes: XXS through XL.\nCare Instructions: Machine wash cold; tumble dry low.\nBest for Summer\nTommy John\nWomen’s Second Skin Sleep Pocket Tee & Short Set\nAs the weather warms, the need for breathable, functional loungewear becomes essential. Designed with a non-pilling, four-way stretch fabric, this two-piece offers an ultra-comfortable silhouette that moves with you. The T-shirt is extremely lightweight, and the thick waistband stays put without rolling down or pinching your skin. It delivers a stylish fit reminiscent of the iconic Calvin Klein look but with added functionality. This set also has practical details that elevate its everyday wearability, like two side pockets for your phone, lip balm, or midnight snacks. The set comes in black and springtime prints like lavender and pink floral. Plus, there’s a heather version made from a cozy modal-polyester blend.\nMaterial: 90 percent modal, 10 percent Spandex.\nSizes: XS through XXL.\nCare Instructions: Machine wash cold; tumble dry low.\nBest Sustainable Set\nStripe & Stare\nPale Pink Stripe Long Pajama Set\nIf you’re trying to be more intentional with your purchases but still want to feel like a cupcake, Stripe & Stare is designed by women, for women. The Pale Pink Stripe set is reminiscent of an early-aughts Victoria’s Secret aesthetic. These PJs are made from 95 percent Tencel MicroModal, a biodegradable fiber spun from trees. It’s breathable, moisture-wicking, and antibacterial. According to Stripe & Stare, it’s also more than twice as soft as cotton. My skin agrees. It feels like sleeping in a baby blanket. If I’m being nitpicky, the pants could use an extra inch or two—I’m 5’8” and still felt a bit ankle-bared, even after sizing up. Bonus: One tree gets planted with every order.\nMaterial: 95 percent Tencel modal, 5 percent elastane.\nSizes: XS through 4X.\nCare Instructions: Wash in a cool, 30-degree wash or by hand. Dry flat.\nBest Pattern\nNeendi\nTakeout Long Pajama Set\nNeendi is for maximalists, for people who believe sleepwear should be loud and spark joy. The Takeout Long Pajama Set is my favorite—it’s covered in pink takeout boxes and chopsticks—but the rest of the menu is just as yummy: Breakfast, Vintage Buttercream Cake, and ’Shrooms, plus Abstract Daisy and Checkered Swirl. Both pieces are cut loose and flowy; it’s not silk but feels like it. The button-down top has a flirty, deep V line, a high-low hem, and flat buttons. The breezy pants are high-rise with split hems and deep pockets.\nMaterial: 51 percent rayon, 49 percent viscose.\nSizes: XS through XL.\nCare Instructions: Machine wash cold in delicate cycle. Hang to dry.\nWired Coupons\n10% off Dell Coupon Code for New Customers\nSamsung Promo Code: 10% off TVs\nBusiness PCs - Extra 5% Off HP Coupon Code\n10% off Canon promo code with upgrade\nExclusive NordVPN Coupon: 76% off\nLG Promo Code: 20% Off Your First Order",

    "content_text": "What is the future of the like button in the age of artificial intelligence? Max Levchin—the PayPal cofounder and Affirm CEO—sees a new and hugely valuable role for liking data to train AI to arrive at conclusions more in line with those a human decisionmaker would make.\nIt’s a well-known quandary in machine learning that a computer presented with a clear reward function will engage in relentless reinforcement learning to improve its performance and maximize that reward—but that this optimization path often leads AI systems to very different outcomes than would result from humans exercising human judgment.\nTo introduce a corrective force, AI developers frequently use what is called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Essentially they are putting a human thumb on the scale as the computer arrives at its model by training it on data reflecting real people’s actual preferences. But where does that human preference data come from, and how much of it is needed for the input to be valid? So far, this has been the problem with RLHF: It’s a costly method if it requires hiring human supervisors and annotators to enter feedback.\nAnd this is the problem that Levchin thinks could be solved by the like button. He views the accumulated resource that today sits in Facebook’s hands as a godsend to any developer wanting to train an intelligent agent on human preference data. And how big a deal is that? “I would argue that one of the most valuable things Facebook owns is that mountain of liking data,” Levchin told us. Indeed, at this inflection point in the development of artificial intelligence, having access to “what content is liked by humans, to use for training of AI models, is probably one of the singularly most valuable things on the internet.”\nWhile Levchin envisions AI learning from human preferences through the like button, AI is already changing the way these preferences are shaped in the first place. In fact, social media platforms are actively using AI not just to analyze likes, but to predict them—potentially rendering the button itself obsolete.\nThis was a striking observation for us because, as we talked to most people, the predictions mostly came from another angle, describing not how the like button would affect the performance of AI but how AI would change the world of the like button. Already, we heard, AI is being applied to improve social media algorithms. Early in 2024, for example, Facebook experimented with using AI to redesign the algorithm that recommends Reels videos to users. Could it come up with a better weighting of variables to predict which video a user would most like to watch next? The result of this early test showed that it could: Applying AI to the task paid off in longer watch times—the performance metric Facebook was hoping to boost.\nWhen we asked YouTube cofounder Steve Chen what the future holds for the like button, he said, “I sometimes wonder whether the like button will be needed when AI is sophisticated enough to tell the algorithm with 100 percent accuracy what you want to watch next based on the viewing and sharing patterns themselves. Up until now, the like button has been the simplest way for content platforms to do that, but the end goal is to make it as easy and accurate as possible with whatever data is available.”\nHe went on to point out, however, that one reason the like button may always be needed is to handle sharp or temporary changes in viewing needs because of life events or situations. “There are days when I wanna be watching content that’s a little bit more relevant to, say, my kids,” he said. Chen also explained that the like button may have longevity because of its role in attracting advertisers—the other key group alongside the viewers and creators—because the like acts as the simplest possible hinge to connect those three groups. With one tap, a viewer simultaneously conveys appreciation and feedback directly to the content provider and evidence of engagement and preference to the advertiser.\nAnother major impact of AI will be its increasing use to generate the content itself that is subject to people’s emotional responses. Already, growing amounts of the content—both text and images—being liked by social media users are AI generated. One wonders if the original purpose of the like button—to motivate more users to generate content—will even remain relevant. Would the platforms be just as successful on their own terms if their human users ceased to make the posts at all?\nThis question, of course, raises the problem of authenticity. During the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show, singer Alicia Keys hit a sour note that was noticed by every attentive listener tuned in to the live event. Yet when the recording of her performance was uploaded to YouTube shortly afterward, that flub had been seamlessly corrected, with no notification that the video had been altered. It’s a minor thing (and good for Keys for doing the performance live in the first place), but the sneaky correction raised eyebrows nonetheless. Ironically, she was singing “If I Ain’t Got You”—and her fans ended up getting something slightly different from her.\nIf AI can subtly refine entertainment content, it can also be weaponized for more deceptive purposes. The same technology that can fix a musical note can just as easily clone a voice, leading to far more serious consequences.\nMore chilling is the trend that the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and its equivalents elsewhere have recently cracked down on: uses of AI to “clone” an individual’s voice and effectively put words in their mouth. It sounds like them speaking, but it may not be them—it could be an impostor trying to trick that person’s grandfather into paying a ransom or trying to conduct a financial transaction in their name. In January 2024, after an incident of robocalls spoofing President Joe Biden’s voice, the FCC issued clear guidance that such impersonation is illegal under the provisions of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and warned consumers to be careful.\n“AI-generated voice cloning and images are already sowing confusion by tricking consumers into thinking scams and frauds are legitimate,” said FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel. “No matter what celebrity or politician you favor, or what your relationship is with your kin when they call for help, it is possible we could all be a target of these faked calls.”\nShort of fraudulent pretense like this, an AI-filled future of social media might well be populated by seemingly real people who are purely computer-generated. Such virtual concoctions are infiltrating the community of online influencers and gaining legions of fans on social media platforms. “Aitana Lopez,” for example, regularly posts glimpses of her enviable life as a beautiful Spanish musician and fashionista. When we last checked, her Instagram account was up to 310,000 followers, and she was shilling for hair-care and clothing brands, including Victoria’s Secret, at a cost of some $1,000 per post. But someone else must be spending her hard-earned money, because Aitana doesn’t really need clothes or food or a place to live. She is the programmed creation of an ad agency—one that started out connecting brands with real human influencers but found that the humans were not always so easy to manage.\nWith AI-driven influencers and bots engaging with each other at unprecedented speed, the very fabric of online engagement may be shifting. If likes are no longer coming from real people, and content is no longer created by them, what does that mean for the future of the like economy?\nIn a scenario that not only echoes but goes beyond the premise of the 2013 film Her, you can also now buy a subscription that enables you to chat to your heart’s content with an on-screen “girlfriend.” CarynAI is an AI clone of a real-life online influencer, Caryn Marjorie, who had already gained over a million followers on Snapchat when she decided to team up with an AI company and develop a chatbot. Those who would like to engage in one-to-one conversation with the virtual Caryn pay a dollar per minute, and the chatbot’s conversation is generated by OpenAI’s GPT-4 software, as trained on an archive of content Marjorie had previously published on YouTube.\nWe can imagine a scenario in which a large proportion of likes are not awarded to human-created content—and not granted by actual people, either. We could have a digital world overrun by synthesized creators and consumers interacting at lightning speed with each other. Surely if this comes to pass, even in part, there will be new problems to be solved, relating to our needs to know who really is who (or what), and when a seemingly popular post is really worth checking out.\nDo we want a future in which our true likes (and everyone else’s) are more transparent and unconcealable? Or do we want to retain (for ourselves but also for others) the ability to dissemble? It seems plausible that we will see new tools developed to provide more transparency and assurance as to whether a like is attached to a real person or just a realistic bot. Different platforms might apply such tools to different degrees.\nExcerpt adapted from Like: The Button That Changed the World by Martin Reeves and Bob Goodson.

    "content_text": "As President Donald Trump’s tariff turmoil continues, it becomes increasingly clear that this unpredictability in the US will create economic stress for American businesses and residents. But as with other types of commercial turbulence, the people who will be hit the hardest are those with lower incomes.\nTrump's tariff policy on goods imported into the US carves out some exceptions for smartphones and small electronics, but experts say the prices for those devices will still rise since the companies who manufacture them will incur added costs throughout their supply chains as the trade war continues to escalate.\nAnd while many buyers shopping for a premium device may be able to afford an extra $100 or $200 tacked onto the price of a phone or laptop that already sells for over $1,000, those buying lower-priced personal tech will feel the squeeze more.\n“The challenge is that the people buying low-price products are often the ones who are most price-sensitive and are most harmed by this,” says Shawn DuBravac, chief economist for the electronics trade association IPC. “Generally, lower-priced products have thinner margins, and this holds true across nearly all categories.”\nCheaper cars, entry-level smartphones, and budget laptops and tablets all make less profit per unit than their premium-model counterparts. That means that, unlike with flagship phones and laptops or high-end gaming PCs, companies need to sell more of the cheaper devices to make the effort of building them pay off. If the extra cost added by tariffs makes people buy less stuff, it means the logic behind selling them in the US at all makes less sense.\n“The logic is pretty simple: Lower-priced products compete more heavily on price, which squeezes margins,” DuBravac says. “At the same time, they're typically produced in higher volumes, and the business model often relies on scale to make up for the thin margins.”\nThe president has gone back and forth on which devices will be exempt from tariffs. Regardless of how Trump’s tariffs ultimately play out, which rates he deescalates, or which costs companies are able to wriggle their ways out of, what’s likely to happen regardless is that all that uncertainty could lead to a wider increase in inflation across the economy. Stuff getting more expensive begets more stuff getting expensive.\nAnshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy says that inflation, in this economy, can be almost impossible to wind down.\n“My biggest fear is that because this will drive inflation up, it will create a significant drain on people's disposable incomes and consumption will plummet as a result of these policies,” Sag says. “Even if a lot of these things get ironed out and agreements are struck, it's going to still result in higher inflation and lower buying power for the consumer.”\nOf course, the rising cost of consumer tech isn’t the only force causing financial fragility among poorer Americans. Trump is also set on even more budget cuts that would overhaul and defund federal housing programs for low-income people. In April, the administration purged thousands of employees from the US Department of Health and Human Services, among them the entire staff of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, an agency that literally keeps the lights on for some low-income families. Since January, layoffs of thousands of people across social security, Veteran’s Affairs, and USAID departments could drag down the health, well-being, and buying power of the people who can’t afford to manage without these services.\n“What ends up happening is people don't make purchases,” Sag says. “They get stuck with older tech. And it puts kids at a disadvantage in schools. It may even affect people's ability to find a job or be able to work independently.”\nThe RAPID Survey Project, a research program run by Stanford University’s Center on Early Childhood, collects data on the livelihoods and economics of how more than 22,000 people have been faring since 2020. The Center’s director, Philip Fisher, says that since the survey started, 30 percent of people in US households surveyed have indicated they aren’t able to pay for basic needs. That percentage scales almost directly with inflation. The higher prices are, the less people can afford.\n“Our anticipation is that percentage is just going to continue to go up as the tariffs continue to work their magic,” Fisher says.\nThose price increases are a particular problem for income-insecure households with young children. Beyond an inability for parents to supply kids with their basic needs, the same price uncertainty that has made the stock market go ballistic is likely to affect families as well.\n“When so much is changing so quickly at the national level,” Fisher says, “It filters down to families and to communities and then ultimately to the experiences that kids are having.”\nBeyond poverty, price hikes can also create problems for people at the margins of society and the institutions that look out for them.\nTerah Lawyer‑Harper is executive director of CROP, or Creating Restorative Opportunities and Programs, a nonprofit that receives funding from California’s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and aims to help former prisoners and reduce recidivism. She worries that tariffs will make it much harder to support former inmates looking to reintegrate into society.\n“Technology and devices such as smartphones and laptops are the key connectors to everything we do today in society,” Lawyer‑Harper says.\nA formerly incarcerated person herself, Lawyer‑Harper says someone being released from prison without any resources or tools to engage with society is a recipe for recidivism. Organizations like CROP aim to help provide digital literacy skills and capabilities to access and reenter the job market. Higher charges on products across the board, and specifically on devices like phones and laptops, are going to limit what aid agencies like CROP can do to help the people who need it most.\n“What kind of neighbor do you want?” Lawyer‑Harper says. “Do you want a neighbor that is successful in their job, that has a mindset and understanding of accountability and responsibility, that has secured housing and is stable? Or do you want someone that's struggling and that is going to kick into survival mode and go back to criminal thinking because that's all they know?”\nPresident Trump has encouraged citizens to “hang tough” while he tries to motivate companies and trade partners to move manufacturing to the US. (A feat that his administration cut support for and is otherwise borderline impossible to make happen in a world with a functional global economy.) For many people, hanging tough will be the only option. And it might not be enough.\n“This is kind of a more societal issue that goes beyond manufacturing,” DuBravac says. “Are we exacerbating a digital divide that we don't need to?”",

    "content_text": "As the US struggles to contain its worst measles outbreak in years, cases have spilled over into Mexico. In an April 25 report, Mexico’s Ministry of Health reported there have been 583 confirmed cases in the country this year, with 560 recorded in the border state of Chihuahua. On April 27, the Chihuahua Health Secretariat pushed the state’s number of confirmed cases even higher, to 713. In comparison, the Pan American Health Organization reported only 7 confirmed cases in the whole of Mexico in 2024.\nThe outbreak in Chihuahua is partly due to its proximity to Texas, which it borders to the north. A major outbreak has been ongoing in the US state since late January, and cases in Mexico have been linked to those north of the border. The United States has recorded 884 confirmed cases of measles this year, up from 285 in 2024, as well as three deaths from the disease. Of this year’s cases in the US, 646 have been in Texas.\nTo try to prevent the measles virus from spreading further throughout Mexico, its Ministry of Health has issued a travel warning for the United States and Canada, where cases have also risen sharply. The ministry advises travelers to make sure they are up-to-date with their vaccinations, practice social distancing, wear a mask, and frequently wash their hands.\nFalling vaccination levels have also helped drive up Mexico’s cases, as they have in the US. In 98 percent of US cases this year, the patient—whether an adult or child—had no history of vaccination against measles. In early April, it was reported that a 31-year-old man unvaccinated against measles had died of the disease in Chihuahua.\nBecause measles is highly contagious, very high rates of vaccination against it—95 percent—are needed across communities to stop the virus from spreading. But rates of vaccination in Mexico have been faltering. Children are supposed to receive two doses of the measles vaccine, the first typically between 12 and 15 months, and the second within the next few years. According to the WHO, in 2023 only 76 percent of children under 2 years old in Mexico had received a measles vaccine.\nIf rates don’t improve, this could allow the disease to become endemic again in North America. According to an analysis by Stanford University epidemiologists, at current state-level vaccination rates in the US, measles could reestablish itself and be steadily present in the country over the next two decades. This would result in the deaths of 2,500 people over the next 25 years.\nIn response to the urgent need to reverse Mexico’s decreasing vaccination coverage, the Ministry of Health has launched a National Vaccination Week, the country’s first nationwide immunization campaign since the Covid-19 pandemic. From April 26 to May 3, the plan is to boost vaccine levels in the group most vulnerable to measles: children from 1 to 9 years of age. The ministry hopes to inoculate 1.8 million children to bring them up-to-date with their shots, by offering vaccines free of charge at hospitals, clinics, schools, and health centers.\nMeasles isn’t the only disease being targeted in Mexico: Children over 4 years old are also being offered the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus) vaccine, and a pneumococcal booster is being offered at 12 months of age. Adolescents, adults over 60, and pregnant women are also being invited to get specific vaccines that they might need as well.\nMeasles is a viral disease, and it is considered to be one of the most contagious in the world. It mostly spreads among children. It is transmitted by contact with infected nasal or pharyngeal secretions and through the air, and it initially affects the respiratory tract. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, abundant nasal discharges, and a skin rash that spreads all over the body. Complications can include blindness, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), diarrhea, dehydration, ear infections, and pneumonia. In severe cases, it can be fatal.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "content_text": "OpenAI announced today that users will soon be able to buy products through ChatGPT. The rollout of shopping buttons for AI-powered search queries will come to everyone, whether they are a signed-in user or not. Shoppers will not be able to check out inside of ChatGPT; instead they will be redirected to the merchant’s website to finish the transaction.\nIn a prelaunch demo for WIRED, Adam Fry, the ChatGPT search product lead at OpenAI, demonstrated how the updated user experience could be used to help people using the tool for product research decide which espresso machine or office chair to buy. The product recommendations shown to prospective shoppers are based on what ChatGPT remembers about a user’s preferences as well as product reviews pulled from across the web.\nFry says ChatGPT users are already running over a billion web searches per week, and that people are using the tool to research a wide breadth of shopping categories, like beauty, home goods, and electronics. The product results in ChatGPT for best office chairs, one of WIRED’s rigorously tested and widely read buying guides, included a link to our reporting in the sources tab. (Although the business side of Condé Nast, WIRED’s parent company, signed a licensing deal last year with OpenAI so the company can surface our content, the editorial team retains independence in how we cover the startup.)\nThe new user experience of buying stuff inside of ChatGPT shares many similarities to Google Shopping. In the interfaces of both, when you click on the image of a budget office chair that tickles your fancy, multiple retailers, like Amazon and Walmart, are listed on the right side of the screen, with buttons for completing the purchase. There is one major difference between shopping through ChatGPT versus Google, for now: The results you see in OpenAI searches are not paid placements, but organic results. “They are not ads,” says Fry. “They are not sponsored.”\nWhile some product recommendations that appear inside of Google Shopping show up because retailers paid for them to be there, that’s just one mechanism Google uses to decide which products to list in Shopping searches. Websites that publish product reviews are constantly tweaking the content of their buying recommendations in an effort to convince the opaque Google algorithm that the website includes high-quality reviews of products that have been thoroughly tested by real humans. Google favors those more considered reviews in search results and will rank them highly when a user is researching a product. To land one of the top spots in a Google search can lead to more of those users buying the product through the website, potentially earning the publisher millions of dollars in affiliate revenue.\nSo how does ChatGPT choose which products to recommend? Why were those specific espresso machines and office chairs listed first when the user typed the prompt?\n“It’s not looking for specific signals that are in some algorithm,” says Fry. According to him, this will be a shopping experience that’s more personalized and conversational, rather than keyword-focused. “It's trying to understand how people are reviewing this, how people are talking about this, what the pros and cons are,” says Fry. If you say that you prefer only buying black clothes from a specific retailer, then ChatGPT will supposedly store that information in its memory the next time you ask for advice about what shirt to buy, giving you recommendations that align with your tastes.\nThe reviews that ChatGPT features for products will pull from a blend of online sources, including editorial publishers like WIRED as well as user-generated forums like Reddit. Fry says that users can tell ChatGPT which types of reviews to prioritize when curating a list of recommended products.\nOne of the most pressing questions for online publishers with this new release is likely how affiliate revenue will work in this situation. Currently, if you read WIRED’s review of the best office chairs and decide to purchase one through our link, we get a cut of the revenue and it supports our journalism. How will affiliate revenue work inside of ChatGPT shopping when the tool recommends an office chair that OpenAI knows is a good pick because WIRED, among others, gave it a good review?\n“We are going to be experimenting with a whole bunch of different ways that this can work,” says Fry. He didn’t share specific plans, saying that providing high-quality recommendations is OpenAI’s first priority right now, and that the company might try different affiliate revenue models in the future.\nWhen asked if he sees this as potentially a meaningful revenue driver in the long term, Fry similarly says that OpenAI is just focused on the user experience first and will iterate on ChatGPT shopping as the startup learns more post-release. OpenAI has big revenue goals; according to reporting from The Information, the company expects to bring in $125 billion in revenue by 2029. Last year, OpenAI had just under $4 billion in revenue. It's unclear how big a part the company expects affiliate revenue to play in reaching that goal. CEO Sam Altman floated the idea of affiliate fees adding to the company’s revenue in a recent interview with Stratechery newsletter writer Ben Thompson.\nThis is not the first shopping-adjacent release from OpenAI in 2025. Its AI agent, called Operator, can take control of web browsers and click around, potentially helping users buy groceries or assist with vacation booking, though my initial impressions found the feature to be fairly clunky at release. Perplexity, one of OpenAI’s competitors in AI-powered search, launched “Buy with Pro” late last year, where users could also shop directly inside of the app. Additionally, the Google Shopping tab currently includes a “Researched with AI” section for some queries, with summaries of online reviews as well as recommended picks.",

    "content_text": "When Italian philosopher and essayist Andrea Colamedici released Ipnocrazia: Trump, Musk e La Nuova Architettura Della Realtà (Hypnocracy: Trump, Musk, and the New Architecture of Reality), he wanted to make a statement about the existence of truth in the digital age.\nThe book, published in December, was described as “a crucial book for understanding how control is currently exercised not by repressing truth but by multiplying narratives, making it impossible to locate any fixed point,” according to a description by Tlon, a publishing house Colamedici cofounded. While the book attracted buzz in philosophy circles, Italian magazine L’Espresso revealed in April that the book’s purported author, Jianwei Xun, did not exist, after one of its editors tried and failed to interview him. Initially described as a Hong Kong–born philosopher based in Berlin, it turned out that Xun was actually a hybrid human-algorithmic creation. Colamedici, listed on the book as translator, used AI to generate concepts and then critique those concepts.\n“It’s not just a book but a philosophical experiment, a performance. My aim was to raise awareness,” he tells WIRED. He says the point of the book was to help readers understand AI and invent a new concept for this era.\nSo far, Hypnocracy: Trump, Musk, and the New Architecture of Reality is available in three languages (Spanish, French, and Italian) and has sold some 5,000 copies.\n“From figures like Trump, Musk, and other world leaders to the ways in which digital platforms grab our attention, Xun unveils the mechanisms by which power shapes our perception of reality. It is a clear and disturbing analysis that goes beyond traditional critiques of digital society to reveal how reality itself has become a political battleground,” its description reads.\nHowever, the controversy surrounding the decision to use AI to author it, and initially withhold that information, has now become a major part of the discourse around it—and that’s what Colamedici wanted.\n“When readers discovered the truth about how the book was created, many were hurt. I deeply regret that, but it was necessary,” he says.\nWIRED interviewed Colamedici in a conversation that explored the nuances of his project.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nWIRED: What was the inspiration for the philosophical experiment?\nAndrea Colamedici: First of all, I teach prompt thinking at the European Institute of Design and I lead a research project on artificial intelligence and thought systems at the University of Foggia. Working with my students, I realized that they were using ChatGPT in the worst possible way: to copy from it. I observed that they were losing an understanding of life by relying on AI, which is alarming, because we live in an era where we have access to an ocean of knowledge, but we don’t know what to do with it. I’d often warn them: “You can get good grades, even build a great career using ChatGPT to cheat, but you’ll become empty.” I have trained professors from several Italian universities and many ask me: “When can I stop learning how to use ChatGPT?” The answer is never. It’s not about completing an education in AI, but about how you learn when using it.”\nWe must keep our curiosity alive while using this tool correctly and teaching it to work how we want it to. It all starts from a crucial distinction: There is information that makes you passive, that erodes your ability to think over time, and there is information that challenges you, that makes you smarter by pushing you beyond your limits. This is how we should use AI: as an interlocutor that helps us think differently. Otherwise, we won’t understand that these tools are designed by big tech companies that impose a certain ideology. They choose the data, the connections among it, and, above all, they treat us as customers to be satisfied. If we use AI this way, it will only confirm our biases. We will think we are right, but in reality we will not be thinking; we will be digitally embraced. We can’t afford this numbness. This was the starting point of the book. The second challenge was how to describe what is happening now. For Gilles Deleuze, philosophy is the ability to create concepts, and today we need new ones to understand our reality. Without them, we are lost. Just look at Trump’s Gaza video—generated by AI—or the provocations of figures like Musk. Without solid conceptual tools, we are shipwrecked. A good philosopher creates concepts that are like keys allowing us to understand the world.\nWhat was your goal with the new book?\nThe book seeks to do three things: to help readers become AI literate, to invent a new concept for this era, and to be theoretical and practical at the same time. When readers discovered the truth about how the book was created, many were hurt. I deeply regret that, but it was necessary. Some people have said, “I wish this author existed.” Well, he doesn’t. We must understand that we build our own narratives. If we don’t, the far right will monopolize the narratives, create myths, and we will spend our lives fact-checking while they write history. We can’t allow that to happen.\nHow did you use AI to help you write this philosophical essay?\nI want to clarify that AI didn’t write the essay. Yes, I used artificial intelligence, but not in a conventional way. I developed a method that I teach at the European Institute of Design, based on creating opposition. It’s a way of thinking and using machine learning in an antagonistic way. I didn’t ask the machine to write for me, but instead it generated ideas and then I used GPT and Claude to critique them, to give me perspectives on what I had written. Everything written in the book is mine. Artificial intelligence is a tool that we must learn to use, because if we misuse it—and “misuse” includes treating it as a sort of oracle, asking it to “tell me the answer to the world’s questions; explain to me why I exist”—then we lose our ability to think. We become stupid. Nam June Paik, a great artist of the 1990s, said: “I use technology in order to hate it properly.” And that is what we must do: understand it, because if we don’t, it will use us. AI will become the tool that big tech uses to control us and manipulate us. We must learn to use these tools correctly; otherwise, we’ll be facing a serious problem.\nWhy did you choose to present yourself as a translator rather than an author?\nI use translator as a metaphor. Yes, I am the translator, but not in the literal sense. I am one because to translate can also mean to transport, and that’s what I do: I transport something. However, I wrote the book in Italian. I didn’t translate it from Chinese—I don’t know Chinese—or from English (the other language that the fictional Jianwei Xun knows). Jianwei Xun is a liminal figure: a meeting point between East and West, a point where cultures collide. And that is the opportunity he offers, to understand that we must meet in these strange spaces that are AI. We can do it, but we have to proceed with caution and courage. I know it sounds paradoxical, but this is how we must embody this connection. To be a translator here is also to be a translator of a historic opportunity: to reflect on what we do. If we do not reflect on this, we will be mere passive subjects. It has to be problematized. We cannot just say “AI, give me more, more, more.” We must be neither techno-enthusiasts who accept everything uncritically, nor technophobes, because it is impossible to live without technology today. AI is here to stay and we must understand it. It offers an opportunity to live more deeply and we must seize it.\nIf AI can create a convincing philosophical treatise, what is left for human authors? You have said that “we must think, we must be critical.” So what is the way forward for today’s intellectual?\nThis is a beautiful question because if AI can draw better than we can, if it can drive better, if it can make music better than we do ... then what are we doing here? But we should look at this from another angle, not from the neoliberal perspective that turns all of life into a competition where it is all about winning. It’s not like that. We must seek our own personal fulfillment, find a way to express ourselves, with or without AI. What does it matter if someone else can draw better than me? That’s not the important thing. What matters is that I can learn to draw better and improve my abilities—working with AI or with another person (I recommend with people, but if you choose AI, that’s fine). The big problem of humanity is this obsession to be the first, to be the centre of the story. But science already showed us in the 19th century that we are not at the centre of the universe; we are in a remote corner of the Milky Way. Nor are we even the centre of life on Earth: more than 99% of the biomass is plants, trees, other life forms. We are so small and we have only been here for a very short time, barely 200,000 years. Think of a pine tree or other species; a chicken, which is a much older species. Even among humans, we aren’t a whole. “I am large, I contain multitudes,” as Walt Whitman said. We are also not the most intelligent species on the planet. That doesn’t have to be understood as a tragedy, it can be viewed as a liberation.\nLet’s talk about Ipnocrazia [Hypnocracy]. Why did you choose that title for your book? And while we’re at it, let’s delve some into the Trump-Musk relationship that you analyse in the book.\nYes, I talk about a hypnocracy because what is happening is not a power physically acting on our bodies nor even on our minds, but instead on our very state of consciousness. This is what is happening to us: They are manipulating, through algorithms, our way of perceiving the world. And that is really dangerous. When we use a smartphone and social networks, we think we are connected to the world. We read newspapers, but we receive a personalized timeline that create a bespoke reality for us.\nThis is very concerning. We think we inhabit the same world as others, but our reality is shaped by our biases, opinions, and political positions. We need contact with those who think differently, but these filter bubbles and echo chambers only show us our own reflection. We must build bridges to the unknown, to the different. If not, we are heading for civil war. The other will become a threat, when in fact they are first and foremost a mystery—and perhaps even something to be treasured. That should be our first thought when confronting difference.\nCan AI have an original point of view, or does hypnocracy simply recycle human thoughts through algorithms? How would you define this relationship?\nThis is another big question, because there’s a paradox: Hypnocracy begins with a human perspective. Without it, it wouldn’t exist. But at the same time, I couldn’t have generated this concept without AI. It’s a creative codependency: just as I would need a conversation with another person to develop an idea, I needed that dialogue with artificial intelligence. AI does not live by itself. It requires prompts and stimuli while humans think autonomously. But that is precisely why we must understand what AI is. If we do not respect it for what it is, a tool, we will end up degrading our own humanity. To give an example: If we are used to saying “Alexa, turn off the light” in an impersonal tone, we will end up talking to our partner or friends in the same way. I’m not saying that we need to thank Siri as if she has feelings, she doesn’t, but that we should make sure to preserve our ability to express kindness in real life.\nSome intriguing studies indicate that when we order an Uber through an app, we treat the driver worse than when we call for a car by phone. The risk is twofold: humanizing AI (which is of course not human) and “platforming” people (that is, turning them into interfaces). This is dangerous and confusing these different categories of exchanges can dehumanize us.\nDo you consider AI to be simply a tool for humans, or how would you define its ontological status?\nAI is a human tool, no question. It’s a product of our past, a type of collective consciousness that we created and that helps us understand why we are here. But here’s a paradox: While AI can tell us the weather, recite verses from ancient poets, or suggest possible solutions to problems, it can never help us understand the meaning of life.\nThe mistake is in asking AI “tell me why I exist.” The better approach is to tell it that, “I’ve been reflecting on the meaning of life. I’ve read Sartre, who says that there is no predetermined meaning, but that we construct one. What other thinkers from other cultures, would you recommend I look at in order to broaden my understanding?” The West is exhausted. We need to find other radical connections: with Native American philosophies, the Vedas, and other distant cultures. Therein lies the great opportunity of AI: It’s not an oracle, but a bridge to the unknown.\nWhat led to the choice of Jianwei Xun’s nationality and the specific cultural context for this fictional philosopher? Was it your decision, the result of AI, or maybe a strategy to challenge certain Western narratives?\nThe world needs to understand that Western culture must look outside itself. Western civilization has a serious problem: It still believes that it is at the centre of the universe, the only one capable of solving problems, and it treats other cultures as only being able to produce mere copies at best. This is a profound mistake. Today, that which is truly revolutionary—the ideas that may fundamentally change our perspective on the world—will not come from the West. It’s possible that they might come out of China, but even more likely they will come from one of those spaces on today’s frontier where different cultures meet. And we need to beware that even the concepts of East and West are absurd simplifications, but I use them for now.\nI wanted to create a perspective that sits outside of this Western narcissism. Something that combined the new with old but forgotten ways of thinking. In Italy, for example, we have a crazy situation: The government demands that schools teach that only we have a history. Can you imagine? As if the Chinese dynasties or the indigenous peoples of America and Oceania did not. This reflects the fragility of a society that, instead of accepting that it is losing its centrality—which is not a tragedy, but a liberation—clings to ridiculous myths.\nThe book has become a publishing phenomenon. What do you attribute this success to? Is it interest in the conversation about AI, the philosophical provocation, the debate about authorship in the digital age?\nIt’s true that we’ve had three printings already, although I don't remember whether they were 2,000 or 3,000 copies each. In total, the book has sold between 4,000 and 5,000 copies. But the strangest thing was when a journalist from [the Spanish newspaper] El País contacted me and asked: “Did you use a pseudonym to sell more copies?” It’s actually the other way around! In Italy my books already sell well; I don’t need to invent other names. The first printing was, in fact, only 70 copies; it was an experiment. Then I saw that the concept resonated with readers and we increased the print runs.\nRight now, my life is chaotic. I have interviews in five countries, packed schedules of events in France and Spain. But this is a great opportunity and, although it’s fun, it’s serious too. Play is not a trivial thing: If we don’t play, then what are we living for? We are in a dark historical moment; we need to reinvent how we exist.\nWhen El País learned that the philosopher and coauthor of this book wasn’t real, they decided to remove their review of the book from their website. If the thesis of the book is valid and it contributes to an important debate, why delete it instead of contextualizing it? Do you think this reflects our inability to handle the ambiguity between fiction and truth in the age of AI?\nI understand that fear. Journalism is under attack, and many media outlets act out of fear of damaging their credibility. Their first instinct is to attack something they see as an “impostor” and erase all traces of it. It’s an understandable reaction, even necessary in some cases, because we must protect journalists. They are crucial to uncovering the truth and restoring trust in experts. But the mistake that El País made was not taking the time to understand the context. For example, they talked about the EU’s AI Act, but in 2023 I attended the [State of the European Union], and I listened to Ursula von der Leyen [president of the European Commission]. She admitted that tech moves faster than regulation, and that legislating is complex because innovation doesn’t wait. El País could have gone deeper into that. Instead of deleting the review, they could have created something more nuanced along the lines of “Yes, the author is fictional, but his analysis of AI is relevant because ...”\nHowever, I understand why the media acted as they did: They played it safe. The problem is that’s not the smartest solution. The smart thing would be to open dialogues, to accept that nobody knows everything about AI. It is a huge and changing field and we should encourage curiosity as a driving force. People are exhausted and scared, but curiosity generates energy. We need more complex discourses, not simplifications driven by fear.\nThe game, if you will, behind the book exposes a paradox: Readers connected to the fictional philosopher despite knowing he was a creation and not a real person. Doesn’t this demonstrate that, in the age of AI, we crave believable stories more than real facts?\nI don’t know. We’ll see how the public reacts now that they know the book is more complex than it first appeared. Before, readers were drawn to it thanks to its interesting theories; now they face two challenges: to discover the real structure of the text—perhaps not until they reach the end—and to approach it with the knowledge that the “author” is not a conventional one. I have read articles in Italian media that embody an absurd contradiction. They engage deeply with the research, but then the headlines reduce the book to its most sensational element: “The Philosopher Who Is an AI Creation.” But no, it’s not that the AI wrote this book, it’s an investigation into ideas of authorship and truth. I know it’s hard to sum it up in a headline, but we should take a few minutes to reflect on it. Otherwise, we feed a tendency to simplify ideas and sow mistrust. We have a huge responsibility to readers.\nA possible more nuanced headline could be “An AI Philosopher or a Reflection of Our Times?” But instead we prefer the easy click. Our world now revolves around the immediate reward even when we should encourage slower pursuits—meditation and productive boredom. As Walter Benjamin said: “Boredom is the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience.” You have to sit on the egg and wait for it to hatch.\nDo you see other similar collaborations with AI in the future or was this a one-time thing, a way of questioning what it means to be an author in our time?\nI’ll continue to publish works as Jianwei Xun—he’s a bridge between the human and AI—but it won’t be my only voice. It would be dangerous to start thinking that I can only express myself through algorithms. I need to write with and without AI, because I must preserve my ability to dive into myself without intermediaries. Not everyone sees it right now, but in a year or two we will understand the risks of this moment. We are on the verge of losing the ability to think and live without technological dependence. The paradox is that AI itself, used properly, can be an antidote. It’s like a fire that, when it burns in a controlled way, warms us but doesn’t harm us.\nWhen readers discover that this “philosopher” is, in fact, a fusion of AI and human thought, many say they are puzzled and even disappointed. What would you tell them about the value of this hybrid creation? How should they read the book once they know it’s true structure?\nIt’s a fascinating question, because it’s not about percentages—Jianwei Xun is not 30 percent AI and 70 percent human, for example. Jianwei Xun is the name I use when I engage with artificial intelligence. It’s an identity where the human and the algorithmic merge without any clear boundaries. I’d tell readers to enjoy the journey and allow yourself to be amazed, because a sense of being amazed is what we lack today. As Plato said in The Theaetetus, philosophy is born from thaumazein, a Greek word that means both wonder or amazement and terror. This is precisely our historical moment: It is terrible in two different senses of the word—terrifying and awesome. It’s not a matter of blind optimism, insisting that it’s sunny even when it’s raining, but of choosing how to look. It’s choosing to see beyond the abyss, knowing that we may be lost, but we are not alone.\nTrue freedom—and our defense against manipulation—lies in actively choosing to embrace mystery and the unknown, even when it is scary. Only then will technology become a bridge and not a prison.\nWhat do you see as the future of philosophy in the age of AI, and why do you think it’s urgent that we reflect on these issues now?\nThe future of philosophy is found in the cracks between what we might call “normality.” Intersectional feminism has taught us that all truth has layers—not only in the struggle around gender, but in every aspect of reality. And yet we continue to pretend that there are pure bodies, minds, and ideas.\nOne last thing: We have been measuring intelligence with our own yardstick for centuries, ignoring that forests have memories and octopuses dream. Meanwhile, AI infiltrates our refrigerators and the locks on our homes as stealthily as some modern trickster god. It is the myth of Thoth revived: Plato warned that writing, that “poison of memory,” would make us sages only on paper. Today, AI repeats the paradox: It promises knowledge while emptying the act of knowing of its meaning. The trick is to do as Plato did and use this poison as an antidote. Criticize the machine from the machine, write about writing, and think against thought. In the end, the coming philosophy will not be a refuge, but a spur. It is something that will wake us up from the technocratic dream with more pointed questions than those posed by any algorithm.\nThis interview was originally published by WIRED en Español.

If we do not respect it for what it is, a tool, we will end up degrading our own humanity. To give an example: If we are used to saying “Alexa, turn off the light” in an impersonal tone, we will end up talking to our partner or friends in the same way. I’m not saying that we need to thank Siri as if she has feelings, she doesn’t, but that we should make sure to preserve our ability to express kindness in real life.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "At 12:30 pm local time on Monday, the power went out. Across Spain and Portugal, trains and traffic lights abruptly stopped working.\nReports emerged of people being stuck in lifts, and Google Maps live data showed traffic jams in big cities, including Madrid and Barcelona, as they became gridlocked. Major airports warned passengers of delays due to the blackout. Its cause is still unknown. The blackout is estimated to have affected the entirety of Portugal and Spain and small regions in France.\n“Traffic lights aren’t working. The streets are chaotic because there is an officer at every crossing,” says Gustavo, who lives in Madrid. “Water doesn’t reach flats at the top of buildings because the pumps are electric, and the very few shops that are open are only taking cash.”\nThis is every electrical engineer’s nightmare scenario, says Paul Cuffe, assistant professor of the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at University College Dublin. “The reason we don’t have widespread outages all the time is because system operators are very conservative and very proactive about using big safety margins to make sure this doesn’t happen,” he says. Engineers plan for failures in grids or surges in consumer demand that could destabilize the power supply. “These things are unusual, but to a power engineer the latent threat of it happening is always there.”\nSpain’s electricity operator Red Eléctrica said in a post on X a few hours after the initial blackout that it had recovered power in some areas of Cataluña and Aragón in the northeast; País Vasco, Galicia, La Rioja, Asturias, Navarra, and Castilla y Léon in the north; Extremadura in the east; and Andalucía in the south.\nExperts believe that getting the grid back up and running in both countries could take between a few hours to several days, depending on the area. While the grid is powering back up, emergency services will likely be prioritized over things like stable internet connection, they say.\nThere is a well-rehearsed sequence of steps that now happens, says Cuffe. They are going to be doing what is called a “black start\"—a process that gradually reconnects power stations to form a functioning grid again. Electrical supply and demand has to be balanced to avoid further blackouts, meaning as power stations come online, only portions of the grid can come online with them, with the country gradually powering up, step by step. There should be a team within the grid operator that plans for this and that has identified which generators to bring online first, he explains.\n“You should be anticipating every failure that can happen, and you should survive any one of them,” Cuffe says. From the control room, engineers should be able to tell what parts of the grid are definitely functioning so they won’t be flying blind—but it will still take time.\n“Even with a completely healthy grid, to do that black start could take 12 hours or 16 hours. You have to do it sequentially, and it takes a long time. I’m sure there are engineers in vans swarming all over the place as we speak trying to make all this happen,” Cuffe says. “It’s like assembling some hellishly complicated Ikea furniture.”\nThe biggest issue is that without an established, obvious cause for the blackout in the first place, it will be difficult for engineers to know where to reestablish power first without triggering another outage.\n“The challenge is to constantly match supply and demand,” says Ketan Joshi, an independent climate and energy consultant. “You need to perform that balancing act, not just plugging everything back in there.” Joshi describes it as a blackout “in reverse.”\n“When a tree falls on a power line, you end up chopping off a small chunk of the grid. It’s a pain. A hundred homes get blacked out, a crew comes and they reenergize and reconnect the section that was disconnected,” Joshi explains. This is the same thing, but at an enormous scale. “When you have a blackout like the one we are seeing in Spain and in Portugal, the challenge to map supply and demand becomes ridiculously complicated. Every time you connect up a new chunk of households, you have to perform that same balancing act. The generators that are producing electricity have to match the new demand that has suddenly come on to the grid.”\nREN (Red Eletrica Nacional), the main power operator in Portugal, gave a statement to the BBC saying that the outage was caused by “extreme temperature variations in the interior of Spain. There were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 kV), a phenomenon known as ‘induced atmospheric vibration.’” Spain has yet to respond to this allegation.\n“I scratched my head at that,” says Cuffe. Both of the country’s grids may be run by national operators, he explains, but they are shackled together as a synchronized grid, which means if one side fails the other one does too—making it not entirely unexpected for one to blame the other.\nWhen it comes to propping the grid back up, both operators are on their own. The Iberian peninsula is an “energy island,” says Jan Rosenow, vice president of global strategy at the Regulatory Assistance Project, an NGO advancing policy innovation and thought leadership within the energy community. Spain and Portugal’s collective interconnection capacity with the rest of Europe—that is, how much of their energy they can draw from or send into the wider continent—is around 6 percent, far below the 2030 target of 15 percent set by the European Union.\n“There’s a lot of speculation at the moment, but perhaps with better interconnection the problem would have been a lot less worse,” he says.\nIn a press conference, Spanish president Pedro Sánchez said that the cause of the power cut is still unknown and warns against speculation. He claimed that the regions that have recovered power have done so with the assistance of connections with France and Morocco, and confirmed that the hydroelectric plants in Spain are back online. He claims that hospitals are unaffected by the power outage, and that air traffic had been “voluntarily” reduced by 20 percent during this incident. He said that trains will be halted for security reasons.\nBlackouts in Europe do not happen frequently—a blackout across the whole of Italy in 2003 is the closest example that experts cite as having a similar scale to the one affecting the Iberian peninsula. In that case, a tree brought down a line between Switzerland and Italy, causing other lines nearby to take over the power from the failed line and overload. This caused a blackout for 18 hours that plunged over 55 million people into darkness.\nAt the beginning of the current blackout, things seemed more or less normal, says Daniel Borrás, head of editorial content at WIRED’s sister publication GQ, who is based in Madrid. “People understood that it would be a couple of hours, or something like that. Now the feeling is a little different because a lot of communities in Spain are recovering step by step. For example, Cataluña, Galicia, and Pais Vasco are more or less working, but in Madrid it’s basically still a complete blackout. A lot of people are in the streets and in the bars and the terraces drinking something and it’s a very quiet mood.”\nThe main issue where he is, says Borrás, is with people trying to come back into Madrid and finding themselves in terrible traffic because trains aren’t running.\n“No one has lost their sense of humor, and people are going out to enjoy some digital disconnection,” says Gustavo. He says he’s on his balcony enjoying a good book and contemplating going out to buy candles. “I’ll need a couple of hours to decide whether I should get lavender vanilla spa or geranium.”",

    "content_text": "Which Instax Camera Should You Buy?\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nThe first Polaroid camera appeared in 1947. Ever since, the world has been fascinated by instant-print cameras. There's something magical about watching an image develop right before your eyes. Even with a smartphone camera in every pocket, the appeal of the instant print hasn't diminished.\nToday, Fujifilm's Instax line of cameras and printers largely fills the instant camera niche Polaroid created. There are other options, but Fujifilm's Instax cameras and printers have provided the best image quality and most reliable results in our testing. I've been testing and using Instax printers for almost two decades and have owned all but one of these. The lineup can be confusing, but these are the best Instax cameras and printers you can buy based on my experience.\nUpdated April 2025: We added the Instax Mini 99, Mini 41, Instax Wide Evo cameras and the Square Link printer. We've also removed the Mini 90 which is no longer available, and updated prices and links throughout.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nHow We Tested Instax Cameras and Printers\nHere at WIRED we like to extend testing to include “living with” the things we write about. In addition to testing new models when Fujifilm releases them, I own and regularly use several Instax cameras. I have been using Instax cameras and printers for almost two decades and shooting instant images for far longer than that.\nTo test Instax cameras I photograph a variety of scenes, varying light, color, and tones to see how the camera does across a wide spectrum of shooting scenarios (contrary to my photographer's training, Instax cameras tend to give the best results in bright, afternoon or mid morning light). To test the Instax printers I use a variety of images from a variety of cameras to see how the printer handles warmer and cooler tones, whether there are any noticeable color shifts, and how the sharpness varies depending on the source (for example images from my mirrorless camera almost universally come out sharper than images taken with my phone).\nWhich Size Instax Prints Do You Want?\nWhich Instax camera or printer is right for you depends on the print size you want. Instax film comes in three sizes, Mini, Square, and Wide.\nInstax Mini Film: The smallest of the bunch, these are roughly credit card size images (3.4 inches x 2.1 inches), and are vertically-oriented with the large border on the short side. Prices on film fluctuate, but the cost of a Mini film pack is usually about $14 for 20 prints, which puts the price between $.60 and $.70 per print.\nInstax Square Film: Don't let the name fool you, they're actually not quite square at 3.4 inches tall and 2.8 inches wide. They're the most Polaroid-like, though they are smaller than Polaroids. Prices are around $1 per print.\nInstax Wide Film: The Instax biggie, wide prints are 4.25 inches by 3.3 inches, and are horizontally-oriented with the wide border on the long edge. Instax Wide Film prices are the highest, at about $1-$1.20 per print.\nI have found the Wide and Square prints generally appear sharper, with richer colors, but this will depend on which camera or printer you choose, as quality does vary. In the end the choice is up to you. Or you can do what I did and get one of each.\nOther Instax Cameras and Printers\nFujifilm is constantly refreshing its Instax lineup, adding new features like parallax correction and faster USB-C charging, which almost all Instax cameras now offer. In some cases though the company has not stopped selling the old models. In general, we suggest sticking with the latest models, but sometimes you’ll find deep discounts on older models. Here are a few other models that are worth considering.\nInstax Pal for $80: Late last year, Fujifilm introduced the Pal, a tiny digital camera that you can also buy bundled with an Instax Mini Link 2 smartphone printer and a 10-pack of Instax Mini film. I have not tried the Pal yet, but I struggle to understand who needs it. You can get many of the same features in the Mini Evo, but maybe the Evo is less likely to stand up to life in a child's hands? I'll be testing this one soon and will report back.\nInstax SQ 6 for $150-$200: This one is a head-scratcher to me. As noted above, the SQ 6 is a better camera than either the SQ 1 or SQ 40, which seem to have jointly replaced the SQ 6. Heck, there was even a Taylor Swift version of the SQ 6 (I’d hate to see what that’s going for on eBay). Whatever the case, Fujifilm no longer lists the SQ 6 on its Instax website. Still, if you like the square format, the SQ 6 is a fantastic camera. It has a number of manual features not found in the others—I especially like the Lighten and Darken modes, which can be used like exposure compensation—in addition to the fully automatic mode of the SQ 40. There are some nice extras like a selfie timer, close up mode, and the ability to turn off the flash. There appears to still be a fair bit of new old stock out there, so if you can find this one for around $100-$150 and you love the Square film, I say go for it.\nInstax Mini 11 for $80-$120: This one is covered above, but in case you missed it the Mini 11 is almost never worth buying. It’s only a few dollars cheaper than the newer Mini 12 and lacks most of the features that make the Mini 12 such a good buy. If you can find this one for under $50, maybe it’s worth it, but otherwise avoid the Mini 11.\nInstax Mini Link Printer for $145: Fujifilm's Instax Mini Link was replaced by the Mini Link 2, but the upgrades were minor and, honestly, I can’t tell any difference in print quality. If you can find the original Mini Link for less than the price of the Link 2, go for it. The Link 2 sells for $100 most of the time, so if you can find the Link for less, grab one. They’re both great printers.\nInstax 7s/8/9: These are all older, low-end Instax models. They all use a fixed 1/60 shutter speed, whereas the comparably-priced Mini 12’s auto exposure can choose between 1/2 to 1/250 second shutter speeds, making it much more flexible. Given that most of these are hard to find anyway, give them a pass.",

    "content_text": "On the morning of Christmas Eve 2016, residents of a house in Fraser, Michigan, heard a curious pop, pop, popping sound coming from their walls. After initially dismissing it as melting snow falling from the roof, they soon realized the truth: The noise was the result of bricks being squeezed out of place as their home slowly crumpled into a sinkhole.\nThe house and several nearby were evacuated as authorities assessed the situation and determined its cause: a collapsed sewer interceptor, threatening several homes and a long stretch of Fraser’s busy 15 Mile Road. It was hardly the start to the festive season anyone would wish for.\n“This was quite the impact to our system and community,” says Vince Astorino. As operations director at the Macomb County Public Works Office, he’s responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the county’s wastewater infrastructure, including some 68 miles of sewer lines. “An 11-foot diameter sewer, approximately 70-feet deep, experienced a failure which drastically reduced wastewater flow. This section of pipe is near the main outlet of our system, and approximately 800,000 residents rely on it to convey their wastewater downstream.”\nPrompt action from Astorino and his team got bypass systems in place in time to prevent sewage from backing up into residents’ homes, and in the end only one building—the house where the popping sound was heard—required demolition. But it was nine months until the offending stretch of pipe, roughly 4,000 feet of it, would be fully replaced. The direct cost to taxpayers was around $75 million, not taking into account the added costs to residents and nearby businesses as a result of the disruption.\nThe key to preventing disasters like this is regular inspection of sewer lines, hunting down any cracks and fissures that, if left unattended, can lead to soil ingress and eventual collapse of the pipe. But sewer pipes can be dark, cramped, and filled with pockets of gas, making inspecting large networks using traditional methods (typically a tethered, remotely operated crawler fitted with a camera or even in-person) a slow, costly, and often hazardous process.\nThis is where drones come in. Designed and engineered to operate in confined spaces, a new generation of flying robots is being sent into sewers to perform inspections in a safer, more efficient way.\nOne such drone is the Elios 3, designed and manufactured by Swiss company Flyability and used by major industry players like Veolia. Equipped as standard with a protective cage, impact-resistant exoskeleton, 16,000-lumen lighting rig, 4K camera and lidar, it can navigate through dark and dusty pipes while creating a live 3D model of the environment. The modular design means it can also be fitted with specialized payloads like explosive gas sensors or ultrasonic thickness gauges.\nEloise McMinn Mitchell, communication manager at Flyability, says that the company is seeing huge sales growth as a result of the Elios 3’s capabilities and efficiency versus in-person human inspections, particularly when it comes to sewers. “To inspect a stretch of sewer underneath a road, you’ll need teams of at least four people and have to divert traffic in multiple locations. With the drone, you just need two people, and nobody has to climb into the sewer, eliminating confined space risks and exposure to hazardous environments.”\nAs a result, the safety rules surrounding drones are much less rigid than when humans are involved, which McMinn Mitchell says greatly eases the cost of inspections. “There’s an average 40 percent cost reduction compared to traditional methods, and you can inspect 900 meters in a day with the drone compared to 400 meters.”\nIn May 2024, in a drive to streamline their inspection process, Macomb County adopted a technology-led approach combining a remotely piloted Asio X drone, built by Flyability rival Flybotix, with a software program called SewerAI. The total cost of both was around $100,000. Previously, the county had been spending $1 million on inspections every three years, manually inspecting footage for defects, many of which could be missed due to the poor image quality.\nAround 16 inches across and equipped with powerful 40,000-lumen lights, a 4K camera and a cage for protection against collisions, the Asio X can capture crystal clear video of the sewer system while navigating all but the narrowest of pipes. Astorino describes it as a “night-and-day difference” to the old method.\nUnlike some of the latest consumer drones, which fly almost autonomously, the Asio X requires mostly manual control, and in some very unforgiving locations too, as Astorino points out: “It’s dark, air flow can quickly change within a confined space, and managing a flight path above flowing water in a restricted pipe is challenging.” As a result, he leaves flight to the experts: “Our main operator, Captain Zach, is able to fly through some very tricky environments.”\nThat being said, the inspection process itself is straightforward. “An antenna is lowered into the manhole to provide signal strength from the drone controller to the drone,” Astorino says. “The operator will fly the drone from one manhole to the next, recording video through that flight path.” With around 20 minutes of battery life, the Asio X can document around 1,000 feet of pipe in a single flight, capturing not only video but lidar and infrared scans and gas readings as it passes through a section of sewer.\nUnder the old system, video data would be analyzed in the field, with the camera operator logging defects as they navigated through the pipes. Now, the drone-captured data is sent off to contractors at SewerAI, who run it through their AI-assisted algorithms to identify defects automatically. Astorino tells me it’s been a game-changer, saving his team huge amounts of time and money.\n“We performed months of testing against coded video in the field from various contractors against what SewerAI was able to do with the same footage, and every single time SewerAI excelled in what it was able to find and code correctly.” Previously, inspecting a section of sewer pipe might take months, but SewerAI has an agreement to send data analysis back to the county within 10 days; Astorino says it usually does so within 24 hours.\nThe team has been so impressed with the software package that even in areas where the drone cannot go and more traditional methods of inspection are required—small-diameter pipes, for instance—the resulting data is now sent off for analysis rather than being coded in the field. Old data can be quickly reviewed and reanalyzed too, picking up defects the original contractors may have missed. This means repair work can be done where it’s most needed, preventing the sort of worsening conditions that can lead to disastrous and costly incidents like the 2016 sinkhole.\nMacomb County has been a pioneer in this field. It’s the first county in Michigan to utilize this combination of drones and AI software for underground infrastructure inspection and has won two in-state awards as a result of its forward thinking. But Vince Astorino tells me he and his team are always on the lookout for new ways to modernize operations. “It’s hard to count out great leaps forward in technology around this space, especially with the great AI race taking place all around us. We’re keeping our options open.”",

    "content_text": "Automakers are increasingly pushing consumers to accept monthly and annual fees to unlock preinstalled safety and performance features, from hands-free driving systems and heated seats to cameras that can automatically record accident situations. But the additional levels of internet connectivity this subscription model requires can increase drivers’ exposure to government surveillance and the likelihood of being caught up in police investigations.\nA cache of more than two dozen police records recently reviewed by WIRED show US law enforcement agencies regularly trained on how to take advantage of “connected cars,” with subscription-based features drastically increasing the amount of data that can be accessed during investigations. The records make clear that law enforcement’s knowledge of the surveillance far exceeds that of the public and reveal how corporate policies and technologies—not the law—determine driver privacy.\n“Each manufacturer has their whole protocol on how the operating system in the vehicle utilizes telematics, mobile Wi-Fi, et cetera,” one law enforcement officer noted in a presentation prepared by the California State Highway Patrol (CHP) and reviewed by WIRED. The presentation, while undated, contains statistics on connected cars for the year 2024. “If the vehicle has an active subscription,” they add, “it does create more data.”\nThe CHP presentation, obtained by government transparency nonprofit Property of the People via a public records request, trains police on how to acquire data based on a variety of hypothetical scenarios, each describing how vehicle data can be acquired based on the year, make, and model of a vehicle. The presentation acknowledges that access to data can ultimately be limited due to choices made by not only vehicle manufacturers but the internet service providers on which connected devices rely.\nOne document notes, for instance, that when a General Motors vehicle is equipped with an active OnStar subscription, it will transmit data—revealing its location—roughly twice as often as a Ford vehicle. Different ISPs appear to have not only different capabilities but policies when it comes to responding to government requests for information. Police may be able to rely on AT&T to help identify certain vehicles based on connected devices active in the car but lack the ability to do so when the device relies on a T-Mobile or Verizon network instead.\nCharlotte McCoy, a GM spokesperson, tells WIRED the company now requires a court order before handing over location data to law enforcement. “We review each request individually to assess the circumstances and the nature of the request before providing any information,” they say. “Connectivity offers many benefits—including navigation, communication, safety, and maintenance—and customers can mask their location or turn off connectivity at any time.”\nOther car manufacturers listed in the CHP presentation, including Ford, did not respond to a request for comment.\n“There's definitely a role being played by the companies in deciding what kind of standard they're going to insist on,” says Andrew Crocker, the surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “And this is a dynamic we've seen in other areas of tech. Google and Facebook and Apple all played a role in saying, ‘We'll only provide this data in response to a warrant; other data we'll provide in response to a subpoena.’”\nWhen police are investigating a specific suspect, they will often use a technique known as a “ping” to geographically locate a specific device known to belong to that individual. But when canvassing near a crime scene for an unknown perpetrator, authorities commonly rely on a procedure known as a “tower dump,” requesting that ISPs cast a wider net and identify virtually any devices that have connected to a specific cell tower during a certain window of time. Police analysts can then comb through this data and attempt to identify a culprit, often using surveillance footage or witness testimony about a vehicle’s color, make, or model.\nNearly all subscription-based car features rely on devices that come preinstalled in a vehicle, with a cellular connection necessary only to enable the automaker's recurring-revenue scheme. The ability of car companies to charge users to activate some features is effectively the only reason the car’s systems need to communicate with cell towers. The police documents note that companies often hook customers into adopting the services through free trial offers, and in some cases the devices are communicating with cell towers even when users decline to subscribe.\nIn an August 2022 email, one detective noted: “In some vehicles, again [it] depends on manufacturer, the vehicle is still doing this despite the lack of an active subscription, and just sending the data back to the mother ship. This could be due to collecting user data for what the manufacturer sells it for, to providing this data to try to sell you on renewing your [subscription] package that lapsed.”\nThe “tower dump” technique is becoming increasingly unpopular in US courts following the US Supreme Court’s acknowledgement in 2018 that location data raises significant Fourth Amendment concerns. While the Supreme Court specifically avoided addressing tower dumps in its landmark US v. Carpenter decision, a Fifth Circuit ruling last year placed the capability in great jeopardy, concluding that a warrant to “geofence” an area and collect evidence from a wide variety of individuals is inherently unconstitutional.\nOn the back of that decision, a federal magistrate in Mississippi ruled two months ago that tower dumps are likewise unconstitutional. While a “tower dump” and a “geofence” are not precisely the same—the latter relying on GPS coordinates obtained from internet companies such as Google, as opposed to a cell tower—the results are more or less identical: offering police a dragnet with which to accumulate vast amounts of location data on individuals, many if not most of whom are not suspected of committing a crime.\nIn response to the rapid changes in case law surrounding location data, Google—historically a frequent target of geofence warrants—announced technical changes to its software last year, making it effectively impossible to respond to these types of warrants.\n“Location data is some of the most sensitive, revealing information that is generated by our devices, including our cars,” the EFF’s Crocker says. “It's extremely revealing of obviously where you go and where you've been, but also all the people you associate with and all the things you're doing. You can paint a very clear picture of someone's life with just a list of all the places they've been in their car. The Supreme Court has made that very clear.”\nThe police documents reviewed by WIRED alone demonstrate the arbitrary nature of vehicle surveillance upon this shifting legal landscape, with police noting, for instance, that while Verizon will refuse to allow police to define their own radius when requesting cell tower data, its competitors impose no such limitations. Another document notes that while AT&T will conduct “pings,” locating a device in real time, it will only do so for “voice devices.”\nWhat is also clear from the documents is that US police are aware of the control corporations have over their ability to acquire vehicle location data, expressing fears that they could abruptly decide to kill off certain capabilities at any time.\nIn a letter sent in April 2024 to the Federal Trade Commission, US senators Ron Wyden and Edward Markey—Democrats from Oregon and Massachusetts, respectively—noted that a range of automakers, from Toyota, Nissan, and Subaru, among others, are willing to disclose location data to the government in response to a subpoena without a court order. Volkswagen, meanwhile, had its own arbitrary rules, limiting subpoenas to fewer than seven days’ worth of data. The senators noted that these policies stood in contrast to public pledges previously made by some automakers to require a warrant or court order before surrendering a customer’s location data.\nAutomakers “differ significantly on the important issue of whether customers are ever told they were spied on,” the senators wrote. At the time of the letter, only Tesla had a policy, they said, of informing customers about legal demands. “The other car companies do not tell their customers about government demands for their data, even if they are allowed to do so.”\n“We respect our customers’ privacy and take our responsibility to protect their personal information seriously,” Bennet Ladyman, a T-Mobile spokesperson, says.\nAT&T spokesperson Jim Kimberly says: “Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to law enforcement and other government entities by complying with court orders, subpoenas, and other lawful discovery requests. In all cases, we review requests to determine whether they are valid. We require a search warrant based on the probable-cause standard for all government demands for real-time or historical location information, except in emergency situations. For government demands for cell tower searches, we require a probable-cause search warrant or a court order, except in emergency situations.”\nVerizon did not respond to a request for comment.\n“Especially now, with American civil liberties eroding rapidly, people should exercise great caution in granting new surveillance powers to law enforcement,” says Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People.\nJay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, notes that the police documents reviewed by WIRED contained substantial detail about car surveillance that appear to be publicly unavailable, suggesting that corporations are being far more open with law enforcement than they are with their own customers.\n“It's an ongoing scandal that this kind of surveillance is taking place without people being aware of it, let alone giving permission for it,” Stanley says. “If they're carrying out surveillance on the public, the public should know. They should have meaningful knowledge and give meaningful consent before any kind of surveillance is activated, which clearly is not the case.”",

    "content_text": "While children are told stories about elves and reindeer, the truth is that hundreds of thousands of people work year-round to make sure Christmas feels magical. From factory employees in China stringing lights on artificial trees to dock workers unloading containers of toys, this vast labor force ensures Americans can choose from a wide selection of decorations and gifts each December. But all of that is in peril this year as President Donald Trump’s disruptive tariff policies threaten to halt a big chunk of global trade.\nAcross almost every industry, businesses that depend on international trade are waiting in agony as Trump’s tariff standoff with China continues. Some are pausing their orders, while others are scrambling to find alternative suppliers. The disruption, which has dragged on for almost a month, is particularly damaging to industries that run on strict seasonal production cycles, such as for holidays like Christmas. “If you miss this sales cycle, you have to wait the entire year. Nobody wants a Christmas tree after Christmas,” says Michael Shaughnessy, senior vice president of supply chains at Balsam Brands, a multinational holiday decor company.\nCompanies that sell Christmas ornaments, gifts, and toys tell WIRED that April is usually the time when retailers lock in their orders and manufacturing begins. If they can’t start making products soon, they will face a time crunch later in the year, higher shipping rates, and may potentially miss their sales window. As a result, US customers will likely see fewer options on store shelves and be forced to pay more for their usual Christmas purchases this year.\n“Things will be more expensive and there will be fewer choices,” says Jim McCann, the founder of 1-800-Flowers, which sells a wide variety of holiday gifts, greeting cards, and food baskets. “Retailers won’t be forced to discount like they have in the past because there’ll be no reason to.”\nThe Clock Is Ticking\nFor people in the Christmas business, work starts for next year as soon as the holiday ends. Until recently, this supply chain was a well-oiled machine, with everyone carrying out their duty at the right time of the year, collectively building up to the grand festive finale.\nRick Woldenberg, CEO of educational toy manufacturer Learning Resources, gave WIRED a breakdown of the timeline: Placing orders and having factories manufacture the products takes three months, and then shipping them from China to the US takes another two. That means, if a company is aiming to have its inventory begin arriving at US warehouses by mid-September to begin preparing for the December holiday season, they really need to start working now, in April.\nEarlier this month, Woldenberg sued the Trump administration over the tariffs, alleging the president overstepped his authority by introducing such broad import duties. “We are trying to stand up for ourselves and protect our rights,” he says. “We need help now. The sooner the better. We want them to stop.”\nWoldenberg predicts that toy store shelves won’t necessarily be empty come Christmas, because retailers may scramble to find discontinued products or other replacements to fill the gap, but they won’t necessarily be the items customers are looking for. “That is when Americans are really going to find out what a terrible idea this has been,” he says. “We had this once-in-a-millennium amazing supply chain, and it’s being torn apart for no reason.”\nShaughnessy, whose company owns the premium artificial Christmas tree brand Balsam Hill, describes a timeline similar to Woldenberg’s: “In most years, right now we would be starting to ship as much product as possible, because over the next four, five months, we’d be looking to fill up our warehouses,” he says.\nFor now, the decorations industry is still waiting for the tariff situation to change, but the very latest cut-off time to ensure goods reach consumers by December would be the beginning of August, Shaughnessy says. If Trump misses that deadline, his company and many others will have missed the sales cycle this year.\nBut even if the tariffs are reduced or lifted before then, Shaughnessy says, he expects to pay more to transport his products, because every retail company will be competing for the same amount of shipping containers. In a normal year, shipping rates from China to the West Coast of the US usually costs less than $2,000 per container, but the current supply chain disruption is bringing back memories of the pandemic supply-chain shock, when shipping rates shot up over $20,000 per container right after trade resumed. “The system is like a steam locomotive. You can’t slow it down very quickly, and you also can’t speed it up very quickly,” Shaughnessy says.\nFactory Shutdown\nOn the other side of the Pacific Ocean, the Chinese factories that make almost all of America’s Christmas products are also waiting anxiously for their clients to resume placing orders again. Three owners of artificial Christmas tree factories described the same situation to WIRED: US clients that typically place orders every year have either held off or canceled them entirely, leaving some factories with no business while others are struggling to find non-US buyers. All three owners asked to remain anonymous or use only their English names to protect their privacy.\n“The clients that we had relationships with don’t want to cancel everything, so for some of them, we are shouldering the cost increases,” says Evan, owner of the company Heyuan Limei Tree and Light Technology. “Other clients are betting this policy won’t survive after June and things could go back to normal then.” He’s grateful that at least his factory is still running; two smaller ones close by have already furloughed their workers and shut down their machines for now.\nAt the China Import and Export Fair this week, one of the largest international trade shows in the world, buyers from the US and Europe made up just 10 percent of the total registered attendees, Evan says. In previous years, that number was usually about 40 percent.\n“Clients usually place orders from January to March, and we ship out the products from April to August. To be honest, the production window for Christmas trees is not long,” says Jessica, the owner of a Christmas tree company in the city of Jinhua. The tariffs have also resulted in an unexpected windfall for one of Jessica’s clients. Last year, she says, the retailer missed out on most of the Christmas sales cycle because the products they ordered were delayed for an extended period at US customs. Those same trees that have been sitting in US warehouses for almost half a year are not subject to the tariffs, and may give the retailer a cost advantage over their competitors.\nJessica’s factory is right next door to Yiwu, the small Chinese city that has been the epicenter of the global Christmas merchandise industry since the 2000s and now supplies about 80 to 90 percent of the US market. Over the past few weeks, both domestic and international media outlets have flocked to Yiwu to check in with factories and traders, who expressed a mix of anxiety and optimism. Many are turning to clients in Europe, Latin America, and Russia, hoping other regions can help make up for the lack of American demand. Sometimes, that means changing the look of Santa Claus figurines to better reflect European instead of American tastes.\nMagnus Marsden, a professor at the University of Sussex who led a five-year project looking at foreign trade in Yiwu, says that factories need to work together to blunt the negative impacts of the tariffs. The most important thing is to keep assembly lines operating, because without steady gigs, workers who migrated to Yiwu from more rural parts of China will likely go back home and be reluctant to return in the future. “What some companies are doing is giving some of their contracts to other places, to companies that are particularly invested in the American market, with the aim of making sure that they can continue to survive,” Marsden says.\nFew Winners\nThe only businesses that have escaped the impacts of the tariffs—at least for now —are those that sell Christmas-themed products all year long.\n“Many of our suppliers are still figuring out how they will be handling tariffs, and I've locked in tariff-free pricing for this year. The bigger concern will be for 2026 if the situation remains unchanged,” says Paul Brown, operations manager of Santa Claus House in North Pole, Alaska.\nDebi Thomas, owner of the Los Angeles–area store Christmas Traditions, which has been in business for over 30 years, says she still has merchandise on hand from the past two or three years. “People can shop for items that have never been tariffed, and they are certainly going to be cheaper than what some are buying from retail stores now,” she says.\nBut Thomas is still expecting to raise the price of new products arriving as soon as May. Her store sources many handmade items from the Philippines and India, and those vendors have also started informing her that costs will go up somewhere between 10 to 17 percent if Trump’s blanket tariffs on the rest of the world remain in place.\nAs a family-owned small business, Thomas says she will have no choice but to pass down the price to consumers. For now, all she can do is wait for the tariff drama to end. “We wake up every morning and we say, ‘Oh please, let this be the day when the tariffs are canceled. Please, let this be a moment of clarity,’” she says.",

But all of that is in peril this year as President Donald Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/trump-tariffs-penguins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">disruptive tariff policies</a> threaten to halt a big chunk of global trade.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Across <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/uncanny-valley-podcast-trump-tariffs-tech-industry/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">almost</a> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tariffs-are-coming-for-baby-products/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">every</a> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/trumps-tariffs-could-hit-you-in-an-unexpected-place-your-vinyl-collection/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">industry</a>, businesses that depend on international trade are waiting in agony as Trump’s tariff standoff with China continues. Some are pausing their orders, while others are scrambling to find alternative suppliers. The disruption, which has dragged on for almost a month, is particularly damaging to industries that run on strict seasonal production cycles, such as for holidays like Christmas. “If you miss this sales cycle, you have to wait the entire year. Nobody wants a Christmas tree after Christmas,” says Michael Shaughnessy, senior vice president of supply chains at Balsam Brands, a multinational holiday decor company.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Companies that sell Christmas ornaments, gifts, and toys tell WIRED that April is usually the time when retailers lock in their orders and manufacturing begins. If they can’t start making products soon, they will face a time crunch later in the year, higher shipping rates, and may potentially miss their sales window. As a result, US customers will likely see fewer options on store shelves and be forced to pay more for their usual Christmas purchases this year.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">“Things will be more expensive and there will be fewer choices,” says Jim McCann, the founder of 1-800-Flowers, which sells a wide variety of holiday gifts, greeting cards, and food baskets. “Retailers won’t be forced to discount like they have in the past because there’ll be no reason to.”</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class=\"paywall\">The Clock Is Ticking</h2><p class=\"paywall\">For people in the Christmas business, work starts for next year as soon as the holiday ends. Until recently, this supply chain was a well-oiled machine, with everyone carrying out their duty at the right time of the year, collectively building up to the grand festive finale.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Rick Woldenberg, CEO of educational toy manufacturer Learning Resources, gave WIRED a breakdown of the timeline: Placing orders and having factories manufacture the products takes three months, and then shipping them from China to the US takes another two. That means, if a company is aiming to have its inventory begin arriving at US warehouses by mid-September to begin preparing for the December holiday season, they really need to start working now, in April.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Earlier this month, Woldenberg sued the Trump administration over the tariffs, alleging the president overstepped his authority by introducing such broad import duties. “We are trying to stand up for ourselves and protect our rights,” he says. “We need help now. The sooner the better. We want them to stop.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Woldenberg predicts that toy store shelves won’t necessarily be empty come Christmas, because retailers may scramble to find discontinued products or other replacements to fill the gap, but they won’t necessarily be the items customers are looking for. “That is when Americans are really going to find out what a terrible idea this has been,” he says. “We had this once-in-a-millennium amazing supply chain, and it’s being torn apart for no reason.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "The Best Electric Kettles to Get the Water Going\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nAny old Kettle can boil water. But the best electric kettles on this list are creatures of modern precision. They don't just boil water faster and more efficiently than a stovetop kettle, although this is also true. The new generation of electric kettles can stop at a dime at the precise temperature that brings out the best flavors in green or oolong tea, or a light-roast bean from one of our favorite coffee subscriptions. And because they’re meant to live on your counter, our favorites are also perhaps a little beautiful.\nThere are a lot of electric kettles out there. If you're looking for the best bang for your buck or one that's particularly great for coffee, we've done the hard work for you. We've been testing kettles for years to find the best electric kettles worthy of your countertop.\nFor more guides to kitchen devices, check out the Best Espresso Machines, Best Drip Coffee Makers, Best Coffee Grinders, the Best Latte & Cappuccino Makers, the Best Air Fryers.\nUpdated April 2025: We added the Fellow Stagg Pro and the Balmuda MoonKettle and removed the previous model of Fellow Stagg and a Wolf Gourmet True Temperature Kettle that's no longer available. We also rearranged, retested devices where relevant, and updated prices throughout. WIRED contributor Chris Haslam has also tested kettles for this guide.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nStainless Steel vs. Glass\nOur top-line electric kettle recommendations are mostly made of either stainless steel or glass. If you're wondering which to choose, there are pros and cons to both materials.\nGlass electric kettles are easier to maintain. You can spot buildup in and around the kettle more clearly, though that might mean you'll be cleaning it more often. Glass kettles are less likely to get rusty over time too. Since they're see-through, they're easier to fill with water, and you can keep an eye on the boiling process. However, they are fragile—even if they're made of durable glass, you still have to be careful.\nStainless steel electric kettles tend to hide any kind of mucky buildup, but that doesn't mean they're a hassle to clean. They're more durable and often don't get as hot as glass kettles, so they're a little safer to hold. Generally, there are also more styles and colors to choose from. However, it's not as easy to check water levels since the body isn't see-through, and the exterior can often feel hot even if it has a double-walled body.\nDon’t Forget to Descale Your Electric Kettle\nIt's important to maintain your electric kettle for a variety of reasons—it'll increase its longevity, let your tea and coffee taste fresh, and keep the kettle itself looking its best. But as with other kitchen appliances, you can't simply throw it in the dishwasher or scrub it with some soap and water. Below, we answer all the common questions that come with descaling an electric kettle.\nWhy do I need to descale my electric kettle?\nWater contains natural minerals like calcium carbonate and magnesium. When boiling water, the heat causes those minerals to precipitate into a white, chalky deposit inside the kettle known as limescale buildup. Descaling your electric kettle removes that buildup. While limescale isn't dangerous to your health, it can damage the kettle and affect its efficiency—causing it to take longer to boil water. It can impact the taste of the water too.\nHow do you descale an electric kettle?\nYou can descale your kettle using a water and vinegar solution—the mild acidity helps to break down the buildup of minerals. Add equal parts water and vinegar to the kettle and bring it to a boil. If you don't have vinegar on hand, you can also use baking soda or lemon juice. When using baking soda, you should add one to two tablespoons to two cups of water and bring it to a boil. For lemon juice, you can either cut a lemon in half and squeeze the juice out or use a quarter cup of lemon juice. Then, add the juice to one cup of water, mix it, and bring it to a boil.\nDepending on how much mineral buildup there is, or how long it's been since you've descaled your kettle, you can let your solution sit inside the kettle for as little as 15 to 20 minutes or as long as overnight. Then, pour the water out and wipe the inside with a sponge, soft cloth, or soft-bristle sponge. You can repeat the process if you still see limescale.\nHow often do I need to descale my electric kettle?\nIf you live in an area with hard water (which is water with a high mineral content), you should descale your kettle every three months. If you live in an area with soft water (which has a low mineral content), you can wait a little longer. However, you should also descale it if you notice mineral deposits in the kettle, your tea or coffee tastes somewhat off, or you see grainy sediment at the bottom of your mug.\nWhy Water Temperatures are Best for Different Teas?\nWhile boiling water will certainly always brew coffee and tea, different compounds come out at different times, and different temperatures. Tea or coffee that's brewed too hot can unleash bitter astringency, detected as sharpness or even a kinda “burnt” note. Lame.\nThat's why our favorite electric kettles aren't generally just boiling machines. They're the ones that allow you to brew to more precise temperatures, offering you the flexibility to discover the best flavors for yourself by varying your water temp with the same tea leaves or coffee beans, for that matter.\nJust note that the below recommendations are general ranges, but that the best temperature and time will be different for each leaf, each bean, and each person's tastebuds. It's a rabbithole, if you let it be. (Or you can just declare it all way too complicated, boil the hell out of everything, refuese to set a timer, and then slurp it up. You do you.)\nBrewing temperature for coffee: The rule of thumb laid down by the international Specialty Coffee Association is that the best coffee makers should be able to brew within the range of 194 degrees and 204 degrees Fahrenheit. Lighter roasts may need temperatures on the higher end of this spectrum to extract the same amount of flavor in the same time. But brewing technique matters: For pour-over coffee, you'll want to pour at a higher temperature off the kettle, to account for heat loss. For French press, just pour at your ideal brew temp.\nBrewing temperature for tea: There are a few general guidelines laid down by most teamakers and experts. Delicate white and green tea leaves like lower temperatures, and can be scalded by boiling water. Black teas can take higher temperatures. The larger the leaf, according to the Tea Association of the USA, the lower the temperature you'll want to use. The older or more aged the tea, the higher temperature you'd like to coax out the flavors.\nHere's a loose range of ideal brewing temps:\nBlack tea: Black teas like Earl Grey or English breakfast are generally brewable off the boil, but many like to lower the temp closer to 200 degrees.\nPu'erh tea: Aged pu'erh can also take a brew right off the boil, in order to reveal its most interesting secrets. That said, most sources say to lower the temp for younger pu'erh, maybe to 190 or 195 degrees Fahrenheit. Some go even lower.\nOolongs and white teas: The Tea Association likes a starting range here between 180 and 190 degrees Fahrenheit, cautioning you'll need to adjust your steeping times and temps for each leaf. Though note that the world is full of those who won't brew a delicate white tea above 170 degrees.\nGreen tea: Green teas like matcha and sencha are delicate, and might best take temperatures between 165 and 185 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Tea Association. Many sources hew to the low side of this range. If your kettle doesn't have temperature control, try waiting ten minutes after it boils before pouring.\nMore Good Kettles\nWe've tested dozens of kettles, but not every model deserves a top spot above. Here are a few others that work well, but aren't standouts.\nCuisinart PerfecTemp Cordless for $100: This Cuisinart is reliable, efficient, durable, and a long-time favorite of former WIRED director Jeffrey Van Camp. It's a good kettle, and it's been lauded by a number of sources over the years. But its features haven't kept up with the best newer kettles on this list, nor the Beautiful kettle in a similar price range. And the alarm when it reaches temperature is, well, alarming. As in it's loud and long, and you have to take the kettle apart to disable it, which you probably shouldn't do.\nKitchen-Aid 1.5L Pro Line for $200: This retro-kettle looks fabulous in candy red with its old-school analog temperature gauge, and a temp dial that's pretty much just a lever. The kettle's dual-layer construction means it boils quietly and stays quite cool. But Fahrenheit isn't an option and neither is precision. And though it's priced high, the kettle's retro styling extends to the lack of modern features.\nSmeg Retro Kettle for $190: Looks matter, and if you want a stylish kettle in your kitchen, look no further than Smeg. But while we liked the fun, bright pop of Smeg's colors, this kettle is a bit on the heavier side, and at its price range it offers fewer options than other modern electric kettles, such as precise temperature sets and alerts when it's reached temp. It's just a cute, spendy, and reliable electric kettle. There is a slightly pricier Smeg ($220) with some of those features, including preset temperature settings and a keep-warm function, but we haven't tested it yet.\nAarke Stainless Steel Electric Kettle for $250: This kettle is fancy. It comes with an Aarke-branded microfiber cloth. Like other Aarke coffee gear, its crisp, modernist, stainless-steel design looks like something you'd see in Architectural Digest. But at its price, the features are a bit bare bones and fiddly, with a single button rotating through temperature settings. It also gets a bit hot toward its top. That said, it's quiet and it's beautiful.\nArt and Cook Electric Glass Kettle for $43: When I first unboxed Art and Cook's electric glass kettle, there was one red flag: typos on both the box and the instruction manual. That made me a little hesitant, but my experience over the past six months has been perfectly fine. There's no LED light as on the Cosori to indicate when it's boiling, but it holds slightly more water (1.8 liters as opposed to 1.7). It has an automatic shutoff feature, but overall, I found it a little slower to boil.\nBonavita Digital for $130: This kettle is similar to the Stagg EKG I tested but slightly less expensive. It has a gooseneck spout for precise pouring, a temperature dial, a display, and a 0.9-liter capacity. You'll have the option to program up to five presets for your most-used temps.\nThe Bistro Tile x Haden 1.7 Liter Electric Kettle for $128: This kettle is gorgeous, with two options of tile-style exterior that makes it feel like you’re in a Parisian coffee shop. There’s a single power switch and a temperature gauge on the front to let you know how hot the water is. You can’t control it as much as other electric kettles, and it doesn’t retain heat as well as double-walled options, but it’s very design-forward. —Nena Farrell\nTry These Tea Accessories\nOxo Brew Tea Infuser Basket for $15: This is our go-to accessory for brewing loose-leaf tea. The stainless steel is durable and doesn't impart any flavor to the brewing process, and the hole pattern does a solid job of keeping most of the tiny particles out of the hot water. We particularly love that the lid not only retains heat but also doubles as a drip tray.\nKotubuki Matcha Tea Whisk for $24: If you're a fan of matcha, this is a great whisk to have on hand. Equipped with 80 bamboo bristles, it'll help to create a nice froth that brings out all the bright, grassy notes for a delicious cup of matcha.\nEast Fork the Mug for $44: These mugs are expensive, but they're consciously crafted. WIRED product reviewer Jaina Grey says they “feel sturdy, with a gently sloping grip that's big enough for most hands and feels smooth and balanced when you pick it up.” They also come in various fun colors (seasonal options included). You can buy a single mug or a four-pack for $150.\nThe Tea Spot Sipping Cup Tea Subscription for $20 (Monthly): This is a great subscription for new tea drinkers. Each box includes whole leaf teas harvested from tea estates around the world.",

As in it's loud and long, and you have to take the kettle apart to disable it, which you probably shouldn't do.</p><p><a class=\"external-link\" data-aps-asc-tag=\"w050b-20\" data-aps-asin=\"B00CT9XQ7Y\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/28iSGvNLVT39oMQNhCLvk4fP2Pz8wB9Tp5caV2wQwUNvNy54GPBjLcnRciLcR1b5Vw5vrsiVAfqurGq6RkWYBKEjuG6ZnDm9szbTLiWo344VXQuDi8ytHa3rqNCCo3PC8KgX5XqBzHVzTQSojBfYRvnwNJiC8ZK81zDwkjHrDuV4qxavdDSsWnR5p7QVYzgakZKvBJ5PGUoN2aGZ6qwv6BhuhyBQBfyM1Mtma4vFid8e6ymDSejoBMPkbcEwjt35UEyiLXhe57LmN7UX8oZKmrAkR7EBc5gpichbiqqkLSL1XGQ2i2zb32MpfqSSxsPBGTCUGdfJXpiqxi3hNY2XtrzYVxt7HhYntUwj4\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KEK1522CA-Kettle-Candy-Electric/dp/B00CT9XQ7Y\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/28iSGvNLVT39oMQNhCLvk4fP2Pz8wB9Tp5caV2wQwUNvNy54GPBjLcnRciLcR1b5Vw5vrsiVAfqurGq6RkWYBKEjuG6ZnDm9szbTLiWo344VXQuDi8ytHa3rqNCCo3PC8KgX5XqBzHVzTQSojBfYRvnwNJiC8ZK81zDwkjHrDuV4qxavdDSsWnR5p7QVYzgakZKvBJ5PGUoN2aGZ6qwv6BhuhyBQBfyM1Mtma4vFid8e6ymDSejoBMPkbcEwjt35UEyiLXhe57LmN7UX8oZKmrAkR7EBc5gpichbiqqkLSL1XGQ2i2zb32MpfqSSxsPBGTCUGdfJXpiqxi3hNY2XtrzYVxt7HhYntUwj4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Kitchen-Aid 1.5L Pro Line for $200</strong>:</a> This retro-kettle looks fabulous in candy red with its old-school analog temperature gauge, and a temp dial that's pretty much just a lever. The kettle's dual-layer construction means it boils quietly and stays quite cool. But Fahrenheit isn't an option and neither is precision. And though it's priced high, the kettle's retro styling extends to the lack of modern features.</p><cm-unit></cm-unit><p><a class=\"external-link\" data-aps-asc-tag=\"w050b-20\" data-aps-asin=\"B078466G12\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/28iSGvNLVT39oMQNhCLvk4fP2Pz8wB9Tp5caV2wQwUNvNy54GPBjLcnRciLcR1b5Vw5vrsiVAfqurGq6WM1dSrKYqTPkayz8bze57vDpbXjpGpmdrwrWHfhYe4a3Js98yBrXP5QRuY8WkTEQ93hYGfhP5BMizUx8oDQ2BRUAeZMYErRCPtGaYV3fPdxLM2QUh1GD687GBRP7LpVb2KCUbdgBh4KLxz8gTeSgSL7UWwK19Vg6iJGqXMeVNQQPjjXCc5HYnZdBEeP4r6yQN1XwCYqnoX1DrKPdWTRivpNMWMk5f2JmkqSTAveqn1YQcxbP2JvYZQ35MFMuSRWXjdNvyJYUHVaygSQHvSJ7p\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Smeg-KLF03CRUS-Aesthetic-Electric-Embossed/dp/B078466G12\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/28iSGvNLVT39oMQNhCLvk4fP2Pz8wB9Tp5caV2wQwUNvNy54GPBjLcnRciLcR1b5Vw5vrsiVAfqurGq6WM1dSrKYqTPkayz8bze57vDpbXjpGpmdrwrWHfhYe4a3Js98yBrXP5QRuY8WkTEQ93hYGfhP5BMizUx8oDQ2BRUAeZMYErRCPtGaYV3fPdxLM2QUh1GD687GBRP7LpVb2KCUbdgBh4KLxz8gTeSgSL7UWwK19Vg6iJGqXMeVNQQPjjXCc5HYnZdBEeP4r6yQN1XwCYqnoX1DrKPdWTRivpNMWMk5f2JmkqSTAveqn1YQcxbP2JvYZQ35MFMuSRWXjdNvyJYUHVaygSQHvSJ7p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Smeg Retro Kettle for $190</strong>:</a> Looks matter, and if you want a stylish kettle in your kitchen, look no further than Smeg.

    "content_text": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nFor computer scientists, solving problems is a bit like mountaineering. First they must choose a problem to solve—akin to identifying a peak to climb—and then they must develop a strategy to solve it. Classical and quantum researchers compete using different strategies, with a healthy rivalry between the two. Quantum researchers report a fast way to solve a problem—often by scaling a peak that no one thought worth climbing—then classical teams race to see if they can find a better way.\nThis contest almost always ends as a virtual tie: When researchers think they’ve devised a quantum algorithm that works faster or better than anything else, classical researchers usually come up with one that equals it. Just last week, a purported quantum speedup, published in the journal Science, was met with immediate skepticism from two separate groups who showed how to perform similar calculations on classical machines.\nBut in a paper posted on the scientific preprint site arxiv.org last year, researchers described what looks like a quantum speedup that is both convincing and useful. The researchers described a new quantum algorithm that works faster than all known classical ones at finding good solutions to a wide class of optimization problems (which look for the best possible solution among an enormous number of choices).\nSo far, no classical algorithm has dethroned the new algorithm, known as decoded quantum interferometry (DQI). It’s “a breakthrough in quantum algorithms,” said Gil Kalai, a mathematician at Reichman University and a prominent skeptic of quantum computing. Reports of quantum algorithms get researchers excited, partly because they can illuminate new ideas about difficult problems, and partly because, for all the buzz around quantum machines, it’s not clear which problems will actually benefit from them. A quantum algorithm that outperforms all known classical ones on optimization tasks would represent a major step forward in harnessing the potential of quantum computers.\n“I’m enthusiastic about it,” said Ronald de Wolf, a theoretical computer scientist at CWI, the national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands, who was not involved with the new algorithm. But at the same time, he cautioned that it’s still quite possible researchers will eventually find a classical algorithm that does just as well. And due to the lack of quantum hardware, it’ll still be a while before they can test the new algorithm empirically.\nThe algorithm might inspire new work on the classical side, according to Ewin Tang, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who came to prominence as a teenager by creating classical algorithms that match quantum ones. The new claims “are interesting enough that I would tell classical-algorithms people, ‘Hey, you should look at this paper and work on this problem,’” she said.\nThe Best Way Forward?\nWhen classical and quantum algorithms compete, they often do so on the battlefield of optimization, a field focused on finding the best options for solving a thorny problem. Researchers typically focus on problems in which the number of possible solutions explodes as the problem gets bigger. What’s the best way for a delivery truck to visit 10 cities in three days? How should you pack the parcels in the back? Classical methods of solving these problems, which often involve churning through possible solutions in clever ways, quickly become untenable.\nThe specific optimization problem that DQI tackles is roughly this: You’re given a collection of points on a sheet of paper. You need to come up with a mathematical function that passes through these points. Specifically, your function has to be a polynomial—a combination of variables raised to whole-number exponents and multiplied by coefficients. But it can’t be too complicated, meaning the powers can’t get too high. This gives you a curved line that wiggles up and down as it moves across the page. Your job is to find the wiggly line that touches the most points.\nVariations of this problem show up in various forms across computer science, especially in error coding and cryptography—fields focused on securely and accurately encoding data as it’s transmitted. The DQI researchers recognized, basically, that plotting a better line is akin to shifting a noisy encoded message closer to its accurate meaning.\nBut all that came later. When the researchers behind DQI started working on their algorithm, they didn’t even have this problem in mind.\nA Problem Decoded\n“It would have been entirely plausible for a goal-oriented researcher to start by stating the problem and then investigating whether quantum algorithms could solve it faster than classical algorithms,” said Stephen Jordan, a physicist at Google Quantum AI and one of the main architects of DQI. “Of course, for us, that’s not how it happened. We came upon it by a backward and circuitous route.”\nJordan embarked on that route in 2023, when he joined Google and found out he’d be working with Eddie Farhi, a physicist at Google whose work has long focused on quantum algorithms that outperform classical ones. (Farhi was once Jordan’s doctoral adviser at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.) Jordan knew that in 2014, Farhi had made a quantum attack on an optimization problem by thinking of energy, with lower energies corresponding to better solutions. For Farhi, energy connected optimization to quantum physics.\nBut Jordan wanted to do something different. He turned to another concept built into quantum physics—recognizing everything as waves. Using a mathematical tool called a quantum Fourier transform, Jordan found a way to translate all the potential answers to a well-known class of optimization problems into quantum waves. In doing so, he could manipulate the quantum system so that bigger waves (in the form of higher quantum amplitudes) corresponded to better solutions.\nBut there was still a huge challenge that had to be overcome. In a quantum system, asking “What’s the biggest amplitude?” is not as simple as recognizing the biggest wave at the beach. The quantum landscape is incredibly complex, and it was unclear how to identify the quantum amplitudes that would correspond to the best solutions.\nAfter many false starts, Jordan made a breakthrough: The process of selecting the best solutions turned out to be similar to the process of weeding out errors in coded messages, which is known as decoding. This is a well-studied area of computer science, full of techniques that Jordan could explore. By translating an optimization problem into a quantum one, and then applying the decoding lens to it, he had stumbled into a new way to develop quantum algorithms.\nTogether with Noah Shutty, also at Google, Jordan began testing decoding schemes, seeing how they fared against classical algorithms on various optimization problems. They needed both the right approach and a problem where it worked. “It turns out classical algorithms are hard to beat,” Jordan said. “After a few months of trying, we still had not notched up any wins for quantum.”\nBut eventually, the pair landed on a decoding algorithm first introduced in the 1960s to find and fix individual errors in an encoded message. Finding that problem was the key. “When we investigated, we seemed to hit success almost immediately,” Jordan said. Finally, they had found a problem and an approach that, together, looked like a quantum speedup.\nOf course, that didn’t mean it was bulletproof. “Maybe there is some classical method that can efficiently replicate your entire approach,” Jordan said. “Such dequantizations are not always obvious.”\nGaining Confidence\nTo assuage those fears, they consulted with Mary Wootters, a coding theory expert (and Shutty’s former doctoral adviser at Stanford University). She carefully searched for any known classical algorithm that might match their quantum speedup. The advantage held. The team’s checks likewise suggest that it will continue to hold. “They did due diligence,” Tang said.\nBolstered by this analysis, they looked more carefully at the optimization problem they were solving. Jordan had worried that it might be too niche, with no wider applications, but Shutty recognized that this decoding problem was a variation of well-known and useful problems in encryption and other fields.\nJordan acknowledges that without a large enough quantum machine, DQI will remain a theoretical breakthrough. “DQI cannot run on present-day quantum computers,” he said. But they’re still moving forward. Since the group posted their work last August, they have extended the application of DQI beyond the original problem to a broader class of optimization problems, which includes more cases of these “best path” problems.\nSo far, Jordan said, he expects that DQI can beat classical algorithms in those problems, too.\nFor the moment, the quantum community remains elated. “Finding quantum algorithms that show an advantage over classical algorithms is a very exciting endeavor of the last three decades, and the number of definite algorithms that show such an advantage is not large,” Kalai said. “Therefore, every new algorithm is a reason for celebration.”\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

    "content_text": "The big AI companies are continually promising that their tech will save us time and boost our productivity—albeit with big questions about copyright abuse, illegal content, and skyrocketing energy use hanging rather inconveniently around in the background. But if you’re looking to put more time back into your busy schedule, AI can be a useful tool, and maybe in some ways you haven’t even thought about.\nOne of those might be summarizing YouTube videos. AI has already shown it can be a fairly reliable summarizer (although not always), and if you just need to extract a few salient points from a series of videos that are 15 or 30 minutes long, the time saved can quickly add up.\nGoogle Gemini has a new AI model, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, which can plug into Google apps including Google Search, Google Maps, and YouTube. The model is available to all Gemini users, paying or not, and we tested it out on a selection of clips using Gemini's web interface.\nHow to Find the Feature\nIf you open up Gemini on the web, start a new chat, and go to the model picker in the top left corner, you should see one labeled 2.0 Flash Thinking (experimental). This is the one with the Google app connections built in, though most of the time you need to specify which app you want to use (when looking up a place on Google Maps, for instance).\nThe model isn't difficult to find in the Gemini apps for Android or iOS either: If you tap the drop-down menu at the top of a new conversation (which should be labeled with the model you're currently using), you'll see the 2.0 Flash Thinking (experimental) option available for selection.\nYou'll probably find the feature a little easier to use on the web, where you can drag YouTube URLs between browser tabs for analysis, but you can get to it on mobile too. Besides analyzing YouTube videos, you can search for new content: Try asking for YouTube for videos about baseball highlights or science explainers, for example.\nSummarize Match Highlights\nTo begin with, we put Gemini to work on a highlights package of last year's Super Bowl LIX highlights—almost 20 minutes of action—to see what the AI would make of it. To begin with we just asked “What's happening in this game?” and in a few seconds we had details of the teams and who won (which the AI got right), and some key highlights.\nA follow-up question about the final score was answered correctly, but Gemini got the name of the scorer of the first touchdown wrong: The AI suggested it was Johan Dotson. Dotson was shown getting a touchdown in the highlights with the scores at 0-0, but it was ruled out—an example of the nuances that AI doesn't necessarily pick up on.\nGemini did successfully identify when the Kansas City Chiefs got their first points, and even included a timestamp linking straight to the touchdown in the YouTube clip. It also got the name of the scorer right. It seems Gemini is heavily reliant on the commentary for sports clips, which isn't surprising.\nSummarize Video Contents\nNext, we tried putting Gemini up against a behind-the-scenes featurette for The Grand Budapest Hotel, directed by Wes Anderson. The clip runs to four-and-a-half minutes, and Gemini fired back some replies almost instantly: It identified the name of the film being talked about, and the main beats of the clip's narrative.\nHowever, it's all reliant on the audio (or the transcript) again—there doesn't seem to be any analysis of the actual video contents. The AI couldn't say who the talking heads were in the video, even though their names were shown on screen, and wasn't able to say who the director was (even though this was also mentioned in the video description).\nOn the plus side, Gemini did do an impressive job of summing up the audio of the video. It correctly identified some of the filmmaking challenges that were mentioned throughout, and provided timestamps to them — from looking for a set to represent the Grand Budapest, to filling it with extras.\nSummarize Interviews\nFinally, we tried Google Gemini with an interview: Channel 4 in the UK speaking to Charlie Brooker and Siena Kelly about the latest series of Black Mirror (perhaps appropriate for an article on AI). Gemini proved itself very capable at picking out the talking points, and adding timestamps, though of course the whole video is mostly talking.\nAgain though, there's no context about anything outside of the audio or the transcript. Gemini AI couldn't say where the interview took place, or how the participants were acting, or anything else about the visuals of the video—which is worth bearing in mind if you use it yourself.\nFor videos where the answers you want are in the audio of a YouTube video, and its associated transcript, Gemini works really well at summarizing and providing accurate answers (provided the commentators mention when a touchdown is ruled out, as well as when one is scored). For any kind of visual information, you're still going to have to watch the video yourself.",

The best scented candles will elevate the mood, providing ambiance and a wonderful smell that’s exactly as strong as you want it. But it’s all too easy to get a candle that burns poorly, smells awful, or fills a room with a scent you don’t love. I‘m on the hunt to find the best candles you can buy on the internet. These are my favorites (so far), like the Flamingo Estate Roma Heirloom Tomato candle ($60).\nBe sure to check out our related buying guides, including the Best Flower Delivery Services, the Best Handheld Vacuums, and the Best Natural Deodorants.\nUpdated April 2025: We’ve added five candles—from Flamingo Estate, Smell House, Voluspa, and more—plus two candle accessories from Diptyque. We’ve also ensured accuracy throughout.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nHow We Tested and What’s Up Next\nI burned each candle for a minimum of three hours. I took notes and polled my family and friends on the scent, strength, and appearance of each candle. We have many more candles to test from Siblings, Diptyque, D.S. & Durga, Boy Smells, Lafco, Apotheke, Kishmish, Blissy, and more.\nThe tables below include a “scent strength” section. “Strong” means the smell fills the entire room; “medium” means the smell fills the area near the candle but not the whole room; “faint” means you get a whiff now and then, but otherwise the scent is not too noticeable.\nMaterials, Tips, and Safety\nAn in-depth candle explainer is in the works, but in the meantime, here’s some helpful information.\nCandle materials: There are a few popular materials for candles, including soy wax, paraffin wax, vegetable wax, coconut wax, and some others. Paraffin holds a scent well; soy wax lasts for a long time; palm wax has a high melting point. Sometimes candles are made with a blend of wax types. However, you should beware of one ingredient being marketed as more sustainable than others. Palm products contribute to deforestation, but soy isn’t necessarily sustainable if the plants are grown on single-crop swaths of land. Ultimately, it’s hard to discern whether a candle is truly made sustainably. Focusing on a vessel you’ll reuse, minimal packaging, or brands that donate proceeds toward environmental efforts can help.\nCandle tips: The first time you burn a candle, you set the wax “memory.” If you allow it to burn for only a little while, and the entire top surface of the candle doesn’t melt, this sets a baseline shape for the wax that can lead to tunneling. Ensure that you burn a candle evenly to avoid tunneling. If you encounter tunneling, you can wrap foil around the candle while it’s lit or use a hair dryer to help soften the unmelted surrounding wax, but I think it’s way easier to just avoid it in the first place.\nCandle safety: Never leave a burning candle unattended. Ensure candles are fully extinguished before walking away. Keep your wicks trimmed to about a fourth of an inch. Keep candles away from flammable materials (like curtains or hair) and don’t burn them in drafty rooms. Ensure they’re out of reach of pets and children. Don’t burn candles for more than a few hours at a time.\nCandle Accessories\nThere’s a whole world of candle accessories out there, and while you could theoretically just use a pair of sharp scissors or blow out a candle instead of properly snuffing it, dedicated accessories like these elevate the experience.\nDiptyque Candle Snuffer for $52: If you’re stuck between them, the snuffer is the most useful of the two accessories I’m mentioning here. Blowing out candles can be dangerous—seriously, people have suffered horrifying burns because their hair caught on fire. A snuffer extinguishes your candle’s flame without smoke. Simply pop it over the flame (without touching the candle wax) and wait a few seconds. You won’t get that gross wick smell or run the risk of errant embers flying up at you.\nDiptyque Wick Trimmer for $68: This trimmer is a nice accessory, too, though it’s not sharp enough to cut through wax-coated wicks. You should be trimming your candle wicks to a quarter of an inch every time you burn them. I like having a dedicated wick trimmer near my candles because I’m less likely to forget about trimming the wick, and because I don’t get soot all over my kitchen scissors.",

    "content_text": "This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nThe tricky thing about generating electricity is that for the most part, you pretty much have to use it or lose it.\nThis fundamental fact has governed and constrained the development of the world’s largest machine: the $2 trillion US power grid. Massive generators send electrons along a continent-wide network of conductors, transformers, cables, and wires into millions of homes and businesses, delicately balancing supply and demand so that every light switch, computer, television, stove, and charging cable will turn on 99.95 percent of the time.\nMaking sure there are always enough generators spooled up to send electricity to every single power outlet in the country requires precise coordination. And while the amount of electricity actually used can swing drastically throughout the day and year, the grid is built to meet the brief periods of peak demand, like the hot summer days when air conditioning use can double average electricity consumption. Imagine building a 30-lane highway to make sure no driver ever has to tap their brakes. That’s effectively what those who design and run the grid have had to do.\nBut what if you could just hold onto electricity for a bit and save it for later? You wouldn’t have to overbuild the grid or spend so much effort keeping power generation in equilibrium with users. You could smooth over the drawbacks of intermittent power sources that don’t emit carbon dioxide, like wind and solar. You could have easy local backup power in emergencies when transmission lines are damaged. You may not even need a giant, centralized power grid at all.\nThat’s the promise of grid-scale energy storage. And while the US has actually been using a crude form of energy storage called pumped hydroelectric power storage for decades, the country is now experiencing a gargantuan surge in energy storage capacity, this time from a technology that most of us are carrying around in our pockets: lithium-ion batteries. Between 2021 and 2024, grid battery capacity increased fivefold. In 2024, the US installed 12.3 gigawatts of energy storage. This year, new grid battery installations are on track to almost double compared to last year. Battery storage capacity now exceeds pumped hydro capacity, totaling more than 26 gigawatts.\nThere’s still plenty of room to expand—and a pressing need to do so. The power sector remains the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and there will be no way to add enough intermittent clean energy to sufficiently decarbonize the grid without cheap and plentiful storage.\nThe aging US grid is also in dire need of upgrades, and batteries can cushion the shock of adding gigawatts of wind and solar while buying some time to perform more extensive renovations. Some power markets are finally starting to understand all the services batteries can provide—frequency regulation, peak shaving, demand response—creating new lines of business. Batteries are also a key tool in building smaller, localized versions of the power grid. These microgrids can power remote communities with reliable power and one day shift the entire power grid into a more decentralized system that can better withstand disruptions like extreme weather.\nIf we can get it right, true grid-scale battery storage won’t just be an enabler of clean energy, but a way to upgrade the power system for a new era.\nHow Big Batteries Got so Big\nBack in 2011, one of my first reporting assignments was heading to a wind farm in West Virginia to attend the inauguration of what was at the time the world’s largest battery energy storage system. Built by AES Energy Storage, it involved thousands of lithium-ion cells in storage containers that together combined to provide 32 megawatts of power and deliver it for about 15 minutes.\n“It was eight megawatt-hours total,” said John Zahurancik, who was vice president of AES Energy Storage at the time and showed me around the facility back then. That was about the amount of electricity used by 260 homes in a day.\nIn the years since, battery storage has increased by orders of magnitude, as Zahurancik’s new job demonstrates. He is now the president of Fluence, a joint venture between AES and Siemens that has deployed 38 gigawatt-hours of storage to date around the world. “The things that we’re building today, many of our projects are over a gigawatt-hour in size,” Zahurancik said.\nLast year, the largest storage facility to come online in the US was California’s Edwards & Sanborn Project, which can hold 3.3 gigawatt-hours. That’s roughly equivalent to the electricity needed to power 110,000 homes for a day.\nIt wasn’t a steady climb to this point, however. Overall grid battery capacity in the US barely budged for more than a decade. Then, around 2020, it began to spike upward. What changed?\nOne shift is that the most common battery storage technology, lithium-ion cells, saw huge price drops and energy density increases. “The very first project we did was in 2008 and it was on the order of $3,000 a kilowatt-hour for the price of the batteries,” said Zahurancik. “Now we’re looking at systems that are on the order of $150, $200 a kilowatt-hour for the full system install.”\nThat’s partly because the cells on the power grid aren’t that different from those in mobile devices and electric vehicles, so grid batteries have benefited from manufacturing improvements that went into those products.\n“It’s all one big pipeline,” said Micah Ziegler, a professor at Georgia Tech who studies clean energy technologies. “The batteries in phones, cars, and the grid all share common characteristics.” Seeing this rising demand, China went big on battery manufacturing and, much as it did in solar panels, created economies of scale to drive global prices down. China now produces 80 percent of the world’s lithium-ion batteries.\nThe blooming of wind and solar energy created even more demand for batteries and increased the pressure to improve them. The wind and the sun are often the cheapest sources of new electricity, and batteries help compensate for their variability, providing even more reason to scale up storage. “The benefits of this relationship are apparent in the increasing number of power plants that are being proposed and that have already been deployed that combine these resources,” Ziegler said. The combination of solar plus storage accounted for 84 percent of new US power added in 2024.\nAnd because grid batteries don’t have to be small enough to be mobile—unlike the batteries in your laptop or phone—they can take advantage of cheaper, less dense batteries that otherwise might not be suited for something that has to fit in your pocket. There’s even talk of giving old EV batteries a second life on the power grid.\nRegulation has also helped. A major hurdle for deploying grid energy storage systems is that they don’t generate electricity on their own, so the rules for how they should connect to the grid and how much battery developers should get paid for their services were messy and restrictive in the past. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Order 841 removed some of the barriers for energy storage systems to plug into wholesale markets and compete with other forms of power. Though the regulation was issued in 2018, it cleared a major legal challenge in 2020, paving the way for more batteries to plug into the grid.\nEleven states to date including California, Illinois, and Maryland have also set specific procurement targets for energy storage, which require utilities to install a certain amount of storage capacity, creating a push for more grid batteries. Together, these factors created a whole new businesses for power companies, spawned new grid battery companies, and fertilized the ground for a bumper crop of energy storage.\nWhat Can Energy Storage Do for You?\nEnergy storage is the peanut butter to the chocolate of renewable energy, making all the best traits about clean energy even better and balancing out some of its downsides. But it’s also an important ingredient in grid stability, reliability, and resilience, helping ensure a steady flow of megawatts during blackouts and extreme weather.\nThe most common use is frequency response. The alternating current going through power lines in the US cycles at a frequency of 60 hertz. If the grid dips below this frequency when a power-hungry user switches on, it can trip circuit breakers and cause power instability. Since batteries have nearly zero startup time, unlike thermal generators, they can quickly absorb or transmit power as needed to keep the grid humming the right tune.\nGrid batteries can also step in as reserve power when a generator goes offline or when a large power user unexpectedly turns on. They can smooth out the hills and valleys of power load over the course of the day. They also let power providers save electricity when it’s cheap to produce, and sell it back on the grid at times when demand is high and power is expensive. It’s often faster to build a battery facility than an equivalent power plant, and since there are no smokestacks, it’s easier to get permits and approvals.\nBatteries have already proven useful for overstressed power networks. As temperatures reached triple digits in Texas last year, batteries provided a record amount of power on the Lone Star State’s grid. ERCOT, the Texas grid operator, didn’t have to ask Texans to turn down their power use like it did in 2023. Between 2020 and 2024, Texas saw a 4,100 percent increase in utility-scale batteries, topping 5.7 gigawatts.\nGrid batteries have a halo effect for other power generators too. Most thermal power plants—coal, gas, nuclear—prefer to run at a steady pace. Ramping up and down to match demand takes time and costs money, but with batteries soaking up some of the variability, thermal power plants can stay closer to their most efficient pace, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keeping costs in check.\n“It’s kind of like hybridizing your car,” Zahurancik said. “If you think about a Prius, you have an electric motor and you have a gasoline motor and you make the gas consumption better because the battery absorbs all the variation.”\nAnother grid battery feature is that they can reduce the need for expensive grid upgrades, said Stephanie Smith, chief operating officer at Eolian, which funds and develops grid energy storage systems. You don’t have to build power lines to accommodate absolute maximum electricity needs if you have a battery—on the generator side or on the demand side—to dish out a few more electrons when needed.\n“What we do with stand-alone batteries, the more and more of those you get, you start to alleviate needs or at least abridge things like new transmission build,” Smith said. These batteries also allow the grid to adapt faster to changing energy needs, like when a factory shuts down or when a new data center powers up.\nOn balance this leads to a more stable, efficient, cheaper, and cleaner power grid.\nCharging Up\nAs good as they are, lithium-ion batteries have their limits. Most grid batteries are designed to store and dispatch electricity over the course of two to eight hours, but the grid also needs ways to stash power for days, weeks, and even months since power demand shifts throughout the year.\nThere are also some fundamental looming challenges for grid-scale storage. Like most grid-level technologies, energy storage requires a big upfront investment that takes decades to pay back, but there’s a lot of uncertainty right now about how the Trump administration’s tariffs will affect battery imports, whether there will be a recession, and if this disruption will slow electricity demand growth in the years to come. The extraordinary appetite for batteries is increasing competition for the required raw materials, which may increase their prices.\nThough China currently dominates the global battery supply chain, the US is working to edge its way in. Under the previous administration, the US Department of Energy invested billions in energy storage factories, supply chains, and research. There are dozens of battery factories in the US now, though most are aimed at electric vehicles. There are 10 US factories slated to start up this year, which would raise the total EV battery manufacturing capacity to 421.5 gigawatt-hours per year. Total global battery manufacturing is projected to reach around 7,900 gigawatt-hours in 2025.\nThere’s also a long and growing line of projects waiting to connect to the power grid. Interconnection queues for all energy systems, but particularly solar, wind, and batteries, typically last three years or more as project developers produce reliability studies and cope with mounting regulatory paperwork delays.\nThe Trump administration is also working to undo incentives around clean energy, particularly the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The law established robust incentives for clean energy, including tax credits for stand-alone grid energy projects. “I do worry about the IRA because it will change the curve, and quite honestly we cannot afford to change the curve right now with any form of clean energy,” Smith said. On the other hand, Trump’s tariffs may eventually spur even more battery manufacturing within the US.\nStill, utility-scale energy storage is a tiny slice of the sprawling US power grid, and there’s enormous room to expand. “Even though we’ve been accelerating and going fast, by and large, we don’t have that much of it,” Zahurancik said. “You could easily see storage becoming 20 or 30 percent of the installed power capacity.”\nUpdated 4-28-2025 2:40 pm BST: A previous version of this story misstated the capacity of the Edwards & Sanborn project and its home energy use equivalent. It has a capacity of 3.3 gigawatt-hours and 110,000 homes.",

On Wednesday, The Washington Post reported that Hegseth had installed Signal on a “second computer in his office” so that he could “use Signal in a classified space, where his cellphone and other personal electronics are not permitted, and communicate with ease with anyone.”\nThe Associated Press on Thursday added to the picture of Hegseth’s reported Signal use, revealing that Hegseth got a second internet line installed that connected directly to the public internet rather than through the Pentagon’s secured connection, according to sources who spoke with the AP. Hegseth allegedly did this so he could use that second computer with Signal installed. Then on Friday, The New York Times found that the phone number associated with Hegseth’s Signal account—the one he used in that infamous group chat—is easily discoverable online, potentially opening him up to targeted cyberattacks by hostile nations.\nCybercriminals Stole a Record-Breaking $16.6 Billion From US Entities in 2024\nDespite a steady flow of arrests and takedowns of online scammers, cybercriminals are operating at unprecedented levels and making more money than ever. Two reports released this week reveal the stark scale of online criminality. Last year in the United States, businesses and individuals lost $16.6 billion to online crimes, according to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center—that’s the highest figure ever reported and a leap of 33 percent compared to 2023. In 2024, there were 859,532 complaints about potential online crimes, with the FBI saying phishing and spoofing complaints account for 193,000 of them, followed by extortion with 86,000 complaints. Investment scams, which often involve cryptocurrency, made up more than $6 billion of the total losses, with business email compromise scams leading to losses of $2.7 billion.\nAround the same time, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime highlighted that giant scam compounds in Southeast Asia—where human trafficking victims are forced to work scamming people—are generating $40 billion in profits per year and keep on growing. These industrial-scale scam organizations, which are often linked to Chinese criminals, heavily use investment scams (sometimes called pig-butchering) to con people out of their life savings and are expanding outside of the region. “It spreads like a cancer,” Benedikt Hofmann of the UNODC said in a statement.\nGoogle Chrome Won’t Ditch Creepy Tracking Cookies After All\nBack in 2020, Google announced its Chrome browser would stop using third-party cookies, which track people around the web, and would move to a less creepy way of powering its advertising businesses. Web browsers such as Safari, Firefox, and Brave ditched cookies years before Google made the announcement. But this week, after countless U-turns, failed efforts to develop alternatives, and criticism that proposals to replace cookies would favor Google, the company announced it will, in fact, keep the trackers in Chrome.\n“We’ve made the decision to maintain our current approach to offering users third-party cookie choice in Chrome,” wrote Anthony Chavez, the Google VP in charge of its Privacy Sandbox efforts, in a blog post. “As we’ve engaged with the ecosystem, including publishers, developers, regulators, and the ads industry, it remains clear that there are divergent perspectives on making changes that could impact the availability of third-party cookies,” Chavez wrote. While the US government is proposing that Google sell off Chrome as part of its antitrust case against the company, it’s still possible to turn off third-party cookies or use a privacy-friendly browser instead.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nAt a speedy event in New York City this week, Roku announced its plans for 2025, which includes two new streaming sticks, some nice software updates, and upgrades to its top two Roku TVs—most notably the value-forward Plus Series.\nThe new Roku Streaming Stick has two big selling points—it's compact and it's $30, but like the previous Roku Express, it's confined to HD content. That limits its value, but it could make a solid addition to a small den or kitchen TV, thanks to the addition of the Roku voice remote for searching across the breezy streaming platform. For $10 more, the similarly slim 4K UHD Streaming Stick Plus is the hotter value. Both devices can be powered by most TVs directly, meaning no need to plug them into a wall outlet, and they include new software features like a “Coming Soon to Theaters” row and personalized sports highlights.\nOn the TV front, Roku’s top-line Pro Series TVs get a modest update, including “custom factory calibration” to ensure a more accurate picture. However, it's the affordable Plus Series that receives the more significant makeover, including the addition of mini-LED backlighting. While we’ll have to put it to the test, this should help improve dimming control for better contrast and deeper black levels with less light bleed. All Roku TVs will also now include a Bluetooth headphone mode for quick sound swapping.\nThe new streaming sticks are available for preorder and are expected to ship on May 6, while Roku will announce new TV pricing and availability later this year. —Ryan Waniata\nMeta Ray-Bans Get Live AI Translations\nMeta has announced the rollout of its AI-powered real-time translation feature for the Meta Ray-Bans smart glasses to all markets. That means if you’re traveling to another country, you can download the language pack and hold conversations in English, French, Italian, or Spanish without connecting to Wi-Fi or a cellular network. Just say “Hey Meta, start live translation” and you’ll hear them talking in your preferred language through the speakers in the glasses, while the other person can view a translated transcript on your phone.\nI’ve experienced Meta’s translation with text before and found it adequate for reading my children’s books in Spanish; Meta AI even offered, unprompted, some funny insights. When traveling, my coworker Kate Knibbs discovered that live translation is a little awkward when it’s limited to the written word. Live translation with other speakers should make it much more useful.\nThe company also announced new frame styles and colors, like the Skyler cat-eye style in chalky gray, as well as a few more software features. You’ll now be able to send and receive messages from Instagram on your glasses, ask Meta AI to play music from an expanded list of music apps (as long as you ask in English), or ask Meta AI to identify songs in passing. Meta is also expanding access to Meta AI in other countries in the European Union, as well as launching the glasses themselves in Mexico, India, and the United Arab Emirates. —Adrienne So\nKia EVs Can Now Use Tesla’s Superchargers\nKia EVs are finally part of the Tesla Supercharger club, the company has confirmed, and its cars can now access more than 21,500 of Tesla’s DC fast chargers in North America.\nThe move, which was originally approved in January, expands Kia’s charging network by more than 80 percent and sees the automaker joining the likes of Ford, Rivian, Volvo, and Mercedes-Benz in tapping into Tesla’s resources.\nAs part of the move, the company announced that its refreshed 2025 EV6 and the 2026 EV9 will come with Tesla-compatible NACS connectors, but existing Kia EV owners with a CCS1 charging port can get adapters from their dealer. —Verity Burns\nCuisinart’s First-Ever Espresso Bar “Collection”\nAnyone for coffee? This week, Cuisinart announced what it’s touting as its very first espresso bar collection—a Mama, Papa, and Baby Bear of three bottomless portafilter machines. The range starts with a vanishingly slim profile, 15-bar EM-160 Espresso Bar Slim retailing at $230, and tops out with a $600 “Grind and Brew” EM-640 model with 16 espresso grind settings. The mid-sized $300 machine, EM-320, doesn’t have a grinder but adds 5 bars of pressure compared to the Slim.\nThis is hardly Cuisinart’s first foray into espresso, but it does amount to a bit of a reboot for the American brand. Each device in the Espresso Bar collection comes equipped with a frothing wand, a 52-millimeter stainless steel bottomless portafilter, and an option on cold-extracted espresso for iced lattes or martini lovers. The devices offer a fairly tall profile: Cuisinart advertises that each will allow room for a 20-ounce travel mug. Likely the most distinctive of the three machines, the lowest-priced “Slim” device is less than 7 inches wide.\nTuesday was the official launch for the new line, but retailers like Williams-Sonoma and Crate & Barrel quietly added the Cuisinart appliances to their websites in mid-April—an increasingly common strategy from manufacturers who want advance reviews on retailer websites by the time the company’s PR officially declares liftoff. —Matthew Korfhage\nFellow Drops Its First Espresso Machine\nThe coffee news doesn't stop there. With the fanfare and tightly controlled pre-hype usually reserved for iPhone launches, San Francisco coffee device maker Fellow announced its first espresso machine. The retro-futuristic-looking Espresso Series 1 comes in black, cherry red, or malted chocolate. It offers adaptive pressure at the coffee puck, guided brewing, and a steam wand with a thermostat that stops frothing at the designated temp.\nFellow reserved its biggest excitement for the Espresso Series 1’s patented new boiler system, which the company says will offer what it calls the “holy grail of espresso”—true temperature and pressure stability, in a home espresso machine market best known for wild fluctuations and slow heat-ups.\nThe company's research and development head, Nick Terzulli, explained the tech at a livestreamed launch event from the company's San Francisco office. The new “boosted boiler” involves three independent heating elements combining fast heating with a thermal mass heater, a mini-boiler, and a heated group head for tight temperature control at the output. With all three in concert, Terzulli says, you can achieve the thermal stability of a commercial dual boiler on a 120-volt circuit, with less than two minutes heating time. “If you understand physics, you understand why my head is exploding inside my body, right?” Terzulli said.\nThe device costs $1,500, but anyone who buys during the first two weeks of the presale can reserve the Espresso Series 1 for $1,200 and get $100 in free coffee. —Matthew Korfhage\nDuolingo Now Teaches Chess\nStrange things are happening over at Duolingo's headquarters. After its infamous green owl mascot faked his death earlier this year, the language learning app continues its abnormal behavior and wants to teach a new subject that transcends language: chess. It's still in early testing with a limited number of Duolingo users, but it will roll out to iOS in English in the coming weeks, with other platforms to follow in the following months.\nOK, teaching chess isn't all that abnormal for Duolingo. The company began its first non-language courses in 2023 with music and math. Chess is the latest, and it continues the signature gamified learning experience the app is known for. The course is built for people who might find the game intimidating and starts with basics like how each piece moves, patterns, and strategies. You can play fast-paced mini-matches to hone your skills or full games against Duolingo's in-app chess coach.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIn 2019, Garrett Mitchell was already an internet success. His YouTube channel, Cleetus McFarland, had over a million followers. If you perused the channel at that time, you would’ve found a range of grassroots motorsport videos with the type of vehicular shenanigans that earn truckloads of views. Some of those older videos include “BLEW BY A COP AT 120+mph! OOPS!,” “THERE'S A T-REX ON THE TRACK!,” and “Manual Transmission With Paddle Shifters!?!.”\nThose videos made Mitchell, aka Cleetus McFarland, a known personality among automotive enthusiasts. But the YouTuber wanted more financial independence beyond the Google platform and firms willing to sponsor his channel.\n“After my YouTube was growing and some of my antics were getting videos de-monetized, I realized I needed a playground,” Mitchell told Ars Technica in an email.\nMitchell found a road toward new monetization opportunities through the DeSoto Super Speedway. The Bradenton, Florida, track had changed ownership multiple times since opening in the 1970s. The oval-shaped racetrack is three-eighths of a mile long with 12-degree banking angles.\nBy 2018, the track had closed its doors and was going unused. DeSoto happened to be next to Mitchell’s favorite drag strip, giving the YouTuber the idea of turning it into a stadium where people could watch burnouts and other “massive, rowdy” ticketed events. Mitchell added: “So I sold everything I could, borrowed some money from my business manager, and went all in for $2.2 million.”\nBut like the rest of the world, Mitchell hit the brakes on his 2020 plans during Covid-19 lockdowns. Soon after his purchase, Mitchell couldn’t use the track, renamed Freedom Factory, for large gatherings, forcing him to reconsider his plans.\n“We had no other option but to entertain the people somehow. And with no other racing goin’ on anywhere, we bet big on making something happen. And it worked,” Mitchell said.\nThat “something” was a pay-per-view (PPV) event hosted from the Freedom Factory in April 2020. The event led to others and, eventually, Mitchell running his own subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) service, FRDM+, which originally launched as Cleetervision in 2022.\nToday, a FRDM+ subscription costs $20 per month or $120 per year. A subscription provides access to an impressive library of automotive videos. Some are archived from Mitchell’s YouTube channel. Other, exclusive videos feature content such as interviews with motorsport influencers and members of Mitchell’s staff and crew, and outrageous motorsport stunts. You can watch videos from other influencers on FRDM+, and the business can also white-label its platform into other influencers’ websites too.\n“A Race Against Time”\nBefore Mitchell could host his first PPV event, he had to prepare the speedway. Explaining the ordeal to Ars, he wrote: “We cleaned that place up best we could, but let’s be real, it was rough. Lights were out, weeds poppin’ up through the asphalt, the whole deal.”\nPulling off the first PPV event at the Freedom Factory speedway was a “race against time,” Jonny Mill, who built FRDM+’s tech stack and serves as company president, told Ars.\n“Florida implemented a statewide shutdown on the very day of our event,” he said.\nMitchell also struggled to get the right workers and equipment needed for the PPV. Flights weren’t available due to the pandemic, forcing Mill to produce the event from California using a cell phone group chat and “last-minute local crew,” per Mitchell. The ENG camera person was much shorter than Mitchell “and had to climb on whatever she could just to keep me in frame,” he recalled.\nMitchell said Freedom Factory's first PPV event had 75,000 concurrent viewers, which caused his website and those of the event sponsors to crash.\n“Our initial bandwidth provider laughed at our viewership projections, and, of course, we surpassed them in the first week of presales,” Mill said. “They did apologize before asking for a much larger check.”\nOther early obstacles included determining how to embed the livestream platform into Mitchell’s ecommerce site. The biggest challenge there was “juggling two separate logins, one for merch shopping and another for livestream PPV, all within the same site,” Mill explained.\n“Now, our focus is on seamlessly guiding the YouTube audience over to FRDM+ for premium live events,” he added.\nLive events are still the heart of FRDM+. The service had 21 livestreamed events scheduled throughout 2025, and more are expected to come.\nPeeking Under the Hood\nToday, bandwidth isn’t a problem for FRDM+, and navigating the streaming service doesn’t feel much different from something like Netflix. There are different “channels” (grouped together by related content or ongoing series) on top and new releases and upcoming content highlighted below. There are horizontal scrolling rows, and many titles have content summaries and/or trailers. The platform also has a support section with instructions for canceling subscriptions.\nLike with other SVOD services, subscribers can watch FRDM+ via a web browser or through a smart TV app. FRDM+ currently has apps for Apple TV, Fire OS, and Roku OS. Mitchell said the team is constantly working on more connected TV apps, as well as adding features, “more interactivity,” and customers.\nTo keep the wheels spinning, FRDM+ leverages a diverse range of technologies, Mill explained: “At the core of our infrastructure, AWS bandwidth servers handle the heavy lifting, while Accedo powers the connected TV apps, bridging the gap between our tech stack and the audience. Brightcove serves as our primary video player partner, with additional backup systems in place to maintain reliability.”\nFor a service like this, with live events, redundancy is critical, Mill said.\n“At the Freedom Factory, we even beam air fiber from a house 5 miles away to ensure a reliable second internet. We also have a hidden page on [the Cleetus McFarland website] to launch a backup stream if the primary one fails,” he said.\nToday, FRDM+’s biggest challenge isn’t a technical one. Instead, it's managing the business’s different parts using a small team. FRDM+ has 35 full-time employees across its Shop, Race Track, Events, and Merch divisions and is “entirely self-funded,” per Mill. The company also relies on contractors for productions, but its core livestream team has six full-time employees.\nMitchell told Ars that FRDM+ is profitable, but he couldn't get into specifics. He said the service has “strong year-over-year growth and a solid financial foundation that allows us to continue reinvesting in our team and services,” like a “robust technology stack, larger events, venue rentals, and even giving away helicopters and Lamborghinis as the prizes for our races.”\n“Having been at Discovery during the launch of MotorTrend OnDemand, I’ve witnessed the power of substantial budgets firsthand,” Mill said. “Yet, FRDM+ has achieved greater success organically than Discovery did with their eight-figure marketing investment. This autonomy and efficiency are a testament to the strength of our approach.”\nAny profitability for a three-year-old streaming service is commendable. Due to wildly differing audiences, markets, costs, and scales, comparing FRDM+’s financials to the likes of Netflix and other mainstream streaming services is like comparing apples to oranges. But it’s interesting to consider that FRDM+ has achieved profitability faster than some of those services, like Peacock, which also launched in 2020, and Apple TV+, which debuted in 2019.\nFRDM+ doesn’t share subscription numbers publicly, but Mitchell told Ars that the subscription service has a 93 percent retention. Mill attributed that number to a loyal, engaged community driven by direct communication with Mitchell.\nMill also suggested to Ars that FRDM+ has successfully converted over 5 percent of Mitchell's YouTube audience. Five percent of Cleetus McFarland’s current YouTube base would be 212,500 people.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "The NASA rover Perseverance recently discovered a strange rock on Mars, which appears to be made up of small rounded stones a few hundred millimeters in diameter. NASA’s research team is trying to determine its origin.\nPerseverance was launched in July 2020 with the mission of searching for traces of microorganisms that may have existed on Mars in ancient times. It carries seven scientific instruments, including SuperCam, which uses cameras, lasers, and spectrometers to study the Martian surface, and Mastcam-Z, a camera with a special filter to increase resolution, which is used to record high-definition video as well as panoramic color and 3D images. The rover is exploring the Jezero Crater, a region of Mars thought to have once been a river delta.\nThis is not the first time such a strange rock has been discovered on the Red Planet. In the past, Martian rovers have discovered a number of strange objects that could hold important clues as to the geological history of Mars.\nIt was early March 2025 when Perseverance arrived at Broom Point on Witch Hazel Hill, on the rim of the Jezero Crater.\nSatellite observations had shown alternating stripes of light-colored and dark-colored rock in this area. In late March, Perseverance excavated one of the light-colored formations and collected a sample. In the process it discovered the strange rock—which has been named “St. Paul's Bay.”\nAccording to the Perseverance team, St. Paul’s Bay is a “float” rock—that is, a rock that should not exist at this location. But what created this rock formation on Mars, and how it came to be located in this region, remains unknown. This rock appears to be made up of smaller, round, dark gray stones each several hundred millimeters in size. The shapes of these small round stones vary: Some are oval-shaped, some have sharp edges, and some have small holes in them.\nIt’s possible that these spherules are concretions—formations created by groundwater moving through pores in a rock, which suggests that there might have once been abundant liquid water on Mars. However, on Earth these spherules are also created when molten rock cools rapidly, for example after a volcanic eruption. The Perseverance science team is investigating the origin of the small round stones that make up St. Paul’s Bay. It is possible that they are derived from a dark-colored stripe of rock formation observed nearby.\nNASA’s Mars rovers have also discovered a number of other strange rocks during their missions. The first pictured below were nicknamed “blueberries” and were found by the rover Opportunity. They were discovered near Fram Crater, which Opportunity explored during April 2004. Opportunity launched in July 2003 and landed on the Meridiani Plain on Mars’ equator in January 2004. Opportunity continued to explore Mars for more than 15 years until its mission ended in February 2007. The blueberries are said to be rich in hematite, a type of iron oxide (Fe2O3).\nNext was a formation discovered by NASA’s rover Curiosity, in which many small round stones are visible. This formation is part of a formation called the “sheepbed,” exposed in an area on Mars called Yellowknife Bay. These small round pebbles are often found in other parts of the sheepbed as well. Curiosity was launched in November 2011 and continues to explore Mars.\nThe final image below is of a sedimentary rock formation with a “popcorn” texture, discovered by Perseverance. After completing its exploration of a part of the Jezero Crater called Mt. Washburn, Perseverance headed north and reached an area in the Neretva Valley called Bright Angel, where layered, light-colored rocks are exposed on the surface. It was here that Perseverance discovered this strangely textured rock formation, which also contains small rounded stones.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED Japan and has been translated from Japanese.",

Subscribe Today.\nWhat Kind of Glass Stem Should I Buy?\nGlass stemware is available in a broad range of styles, sizes, and price points, from hundred-year-old artisan glassware makers in Central Europe to new brands making their mark on the traditional glassware market. Price considerations of course come into play, but as with so many of the products we use and love in this modern world, the most expensive option is not always the best.\nIf you’re totally new to all of this, a great place to start is with a so-called universal glass—a stem that’s meant for use with any style of wine you desire, from red to white to sparkling. Nearly every brand of glassware produces a universal offering, but some brands only make a universal, offering a degree of specialization and care.\nPeople who get really into stemware sometimes develop a sort of brand loyalty, exploring the full range of one single brand for all of their drinking needs. And indeed, it’s not uncommon for one firm to offer a half-dozen or more options of wine stem, specialized around the highly specific styles of wine meant to be served therein. A huge bowl stem might work beautifully for some red wines, but not all; a narrow, smaller glass might flatter certain white wines, but throttle others. Ultimately you’re into the land of subjectivity with this stuff, and at the end of the day the right wine glass for you is the one that feels best in your hands.\nHow I Tested\nAt the start of the year I solicited product samples from more than two dozen glass manufacturers, running the gamut of style, price, and nation of origin. I then spent several months living with this glassware, incorporating it into every facet of my daily life and drinking copious amounts of beverages from each. In addition to wine, every single wine glass tested for this feature was given a baseline test of mineral water—a topic I am passionate about—because fine mineral water from proper stemware is an immensely pleasurable drinking experience, and because the profound enjoyment one can find from a nice wine glass shouldn’t be limited only to those who consume alcohol.\nMany of the featured brands offer specific glasses meant for certain styles of wine—the Grassl Mineralité, for example, is intended for “crisp, fresh” wines, whereas the Grassl 1885 is purposed for wines with “great complexity and body.” In such instances, I made a point of testing glassware with its intended serving suggestion first, before jumping around with other beverage styles and putting each glass through its paces.\nIn total I tested around 100 individual pieces of stemware over the past several months. Much swirling and consideration took place. It’s almost like, with so much to consider for this guide, I ran into the problem of having to funnel a vast amount of data toward something like a manageable and reader-friendly conclusion. I think it is perhaps worth mentioning that this level of hands-on testing—as opposed to, say, relying on press releases, sales sheets, and the almighty Google—appears to be for the most part unique among wine glassware articles currently available online. This is why you read WIRED.\nWhy Do I Need Multiple Wine Glasses?\nYou might be wondering—quite reasonably!—why anyone would need, care about, or want to consider all these different wine glass options. I think that’s an eminently fair question, one that I’ve thought about a great deal throughout the testing process for this story. For wine geeks, the right wine glass becomes a part of the wider milieu of geekery in which they inhabit, along with other accoutrements like wine bottle openers, wine refrigerators, and so on. But for many other kinds of consumers, wine glasses offer this sort of living node of beauty in their lives—we hold these works of art in our hands, and clink them together in celebration, and they stay with us throughout the evening, coming back to us again and again for another touch point.\nI think stemware argues loudly for itself as an object of pleasure. A proper wine stem makes whatever you’re drinking taste better, and the tactile experience of sipping and swirling from a lovely stem can be deeply gratifying.",

    "content_text": "Meta has a lot at stake in the current FTC lawsuit against it. In theory a negative verdict could result in a company breakup. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg once faced an even bigger existential threat. Back in 2006, his investors and even his employees were pressuring him to sell his two-year-old startup for a quick payoff. Facebook was still a college-based social network, and several companies were interested in buying it. The most serious offer came from Yahoo, which offered a stunning $1 billion. Zuckerberg, though, believed he could grow the company into something worth much more. The pressure was tremendous, and at one point he blinked, agreeing in principle to sell. But immediately after that, a dip in Yahoo stock led its leader at the time, Terry Semel, to ask for a price adjustment. Zuckerberg seized the opportunity to shut down negotiations; Facebook would remain in his hands.\n“That was by far the most stressful time in my life,” Zuckerberg told me years later. So it’s ironic to observe, through the testimony of this trial, how he treated two other sets of founders in very similar situations to him—but whom he successfully bought out.\nThe nub of the current FTC trial seems to hinge on how US District Court judge James Boasberg will define Meta’s market—whether it’s limited to social media or, as Meta is arguing, the broader field of “entertainment.” But much of the early testimony exhumed the details of Zuckerberg’s successful pursuit of Instagram and WhatsApp—two companies that, according to the government, are now part of Meta’s illegal monopolistic grip on social media. (The trial also invoked the case of Snap, which resisted Zuckerberg’s $6 billion offer and had to deal with Facebook copying its products.) Legalities aside, the way these companies were upended by a Zuckerberg offer made the first few days of this case a dramatic and instructive study of acquisition dynamics between small and big business.\nThough almost all of these narratives have been covered at length over the years—I documented them pretty thoroughly in my own 2020 account Facebook: The Inside Story—it was striking to see the principals testifying under oath about what happened. Hey, my sources were pretty good, but I didn’t get to swear them in!\nIn their testimony, star witnesses Zuckerberg and Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom agreed on facts, but their interpretations were Mars and Venus. In 2012, Instagram was about to close a $500 million investment round, when suddenly the tiny company found itself in play, with Facebook in hot pursuit. In an email at the time, Facebook’s CFO asked Zuckerberg if his goal was to “neutralize a potential competitor.” The answer was affirmative. That was not the way he pitched it to Systrom and cofounder Mike Krieger. Zuckerberg promised the cofounders they would control Instagram and could grow it their way. They would have the best of both worlds—independence and Facebook’s huge resources. Oh, and Facebook’s $1 billion offer was double the valuation of the company in the funding round it was about to close.\nEverything worked great for a few years, but then Zuckerberg began denying resources to Instagram, which its cofounders had built into a juggernaut. Systrom testified that Zuckerberg seemed envious of Instagram’s success and cultural currency, saying that his boss “believed we were hurting Facebook’s growth.” Zuckerberg’s snubs ultimately drove Instagram's founders to leave in 2018. By that time, Instagram was arguably worth perhaps 100 times Zuckerberg’s purchase price. Systrom and Krieger’s spoils, though considerable, did not reflect the fantastic value they had built for Facebook.\nThe founders of WhatsApp did reap a stratospheric buyout, because in 2014 Zuckerberg threw $19 billion to acquire their then tiny operation. But, as told through testimony of some of its executives and funders, the acquisition hinged on promises that cofounders Brian Acton and Jan Koum would retain control. The WhatsApp cofounders hated advertising and were adamant that no ads should ever appear on their service. But documents introduced in the trial indicated that Facebook was basing its valuation on the premise that WhatsApp would be monetized, apparently with those despised ads. The founders left in 2018, when it became clear that Zuckerberg was calling the shots. “I espoused a certain set of principles, even publicly, to my users, and I said, Look, we are not gonna sell your data, we are not going to sell you ads, and I turned around and sold my company,” cofounder Brian Acton told me. His penance for this “crime,” he told me, was spending $50 million to create the Signal Foundation.\nThough these founders were pressured to sell, there weren’t literal guns to their heads—and they did cash out in exchange for pursuing their dreams. So we shouldn’t feel too sorry for them. But lately people in Silicon Valley have been chattering about startup guru Paul Graham’s “Founder Mode” theory, which assumes that the person most responsible for creating a company is the best one to run it—and that the world itself benefits from such people. Zuckerberg, of course, is an iconic founder. But the trial is revealing a narrative beyond the FTC’s legal argument about anticompetitive acquisitions: Zuckerberg’s penchant for snuffing out founders to advance his own goals.\nOf course, sometimes founders are well advised to take the money and run. Consider the case of Clubhouse, the audio-based social networking product that exploded during the pandemic. Its founders, Paul Davison and Rohan Seth, fended off multiple suitors, including a rumored $4 billion offer from Twitter. But after the pandemic—and some poor strategic choices—the service deflated like a punctured balloon. In 2023 it laid off half of its staff. On the other hand, it’s still around, and at least in one of its recent town halls, Davison still seemed to be having fun.\nOne question that Mark Zuckerberg did not have to answer during his testimony was how he viewed his own transition from prey to predator. But I did pose that question to him during my book research. We were discussing the mental anguish he suffered during the 2006 crisis. Zuckerberg told me that he often advises young founders not to give in to pressure. This advice, of course, was not offered to those running companies he wanted to buy. So I asked him directly—given his lesson from the Yahoo experience, did Systrom and Krieger make a mistake by selling to him?\nThere was a long pause, not an uncommon phenomenon when Zuckerberg considers a question where a candid answer might put him in a damning position. Finally he gave a response that dodged the issue, saying that Instagram could never have reached its heights without Facebook’s support. He said pretty much the same thing in court this month. On a legal basis, Meta will not be judged on how he bought off the dreams of founders, but whether he gamed the marketplace through his purchases. No judge will rule on the calculus of selling off a dream.\nTime Travel\nIn Kevin Systrom’s testimony, he opined that Zuckerberg denied resources to Instagram in part out of jealousy. The photo-sharing app, which he didn’t invent, was growing faster than Facebook’s blue app, a Mark Zuckerberg Production. When reporting Facebook: The Inside Story, I became familiar with this tension and put it to Zuckerberg: Was he in fact jealous of the Instagram team?\n“Jealous…” he repeated.\nYes, I said. And that you would prefer growth of Facebook’s Blue app to Instagram’s?\nHe said no, and explained to me how he thought about it. Early on … it made sense to leave the founders alone and let them build their best products. “That was incredibly successful,” he says. “And it made sense for the first five years. But now we’re at the point where all the products are big and important. I don’t want to build just multiple versions of the same product. We should have a more coherent and integrated product strategy.”\nAnd if that meant losing founders, so be it. “I can understand if you’re an entrepreneur who built one of those things and had awesome success, you’d wake up and say, ‘Okay, I’m proud of what I did, but this isn’t for me going forward.’ That’s how I see it, and we’re going in the right direction.” Those close to Kevin Systrom, though, believe that had Zuckerberg not asserted control, he would have remained at Instagram for 20 more years.\nAsk Me One Thing\nJim asks, “What was it like interviewing some of the pioneers of modern-day computing for Hackers?”\nThanks for the question, Jim. You are asking me to access the feelings I had over 40 years ago when I was talking first-hand to people who are now legends. But in the circles I traveled they were virtually unknown, even computer science pioneers like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. And to my knowledge no reporter had documented the world of MIT hackers, who pretty much invented computer culture.\nI do recall as the interviews accumulated, I came to realize that the story I was telling was significant and would have continuing relevance. Also, some of them outright stretched my mind. These people were so interesting that after the book was published I kept talking to computer folk.

    "content_text": "According to the Financial Times, which cites sources “familiar with the matter,” Apple plans to assemble in India all iPhones intended for the US by the end of 2026. The majority of Apple’s iPhones are currently made in China, but Chinese-made products have become a toxic asset for US import.\nThe US government has imposed a 145 percent tariff on goods from China. While smartphones are included in a 90-day reprieve, announced in early April, President Trump has indicated this exclusion is indeed a temporary one. Ready to pay $2,949 for a base storage iPhone 17 Pro Max?\nApple’s supposed shifting of its manufacturing to India is an insurance policy against such chaos in the future, but it did not begin here. In December 2024, we wrote about Apple’s growing reliance on India for manufacturing as a bulwark against growing US-China tensions.\nIndian production of iPhones commenced in 2017, starting with the lower-cost iPhone SE. The country began producing flagship-model launch iPhones in 2023.\nDespite being the better part of a decade into Indian iPhone manufacturing, this latest alleged shift in strategy still represents a very costly turbocharging of its efforts—and likely at least a doubling of output from Apple’s Indian production plants. WIRED approached Apple for comment, but had not received a response at time of publishing.\nHow Many Indian iPhones?\n“Our estimates say that Apple produced around 40 to 43 million [iPhones] in India last year,” says Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. “About 12 or 13 million were consumed in the India market entirely, and the rest were exported out.”\nMore than 60 million iPhones are sold in the US each year, where the series commands a 57 percent smartphone market share, according to some estimates. \"So about 80 to 85 million [iPhones] they will need to produce in India,” says Singh, should Apple want to satisfy US demand at current levels while also serving local Indian market demand.\nThis expansion does not solely rely on Apple’s investments. As in all of Apple’s major production efforts, any Indian expansion will involve partners, primarily Tata Electronics, Foxconn, and Pegatron.\n“Tata is completely running at capacity right now,” says Singh. Tata is the primary force behind Indian iPhone manufacture at present. It operates an assembly plant in Tamil Nadu, in the country’s south. It acquired Wistron’s iPhone-manufacturing Karnataka facility in 2023 and, in January 2025, closed on a majority 60 percent stake in Taiwanese company Pegatron’s Indian operation.\nThis in turn represents a consolidation of Indian iPhone production being stewarded by an Indian company, Tata Electronics. Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron are all Taiwanese companies, despite their global reach and importance.\nTrouble at the Factory\nApple’s Tata-led production has not been entirely smooth. In 2023, Tata’s Hosur factory, which produced iPhone casings, reportedly had a yield rate of just 50 percent, with half of the components failing Apple’s rigorous quality checks. This is a very low yield rate, and it highlights the importance of a skilled and efficient manufacturing operation.\n“There just isn’t a sense of urgency,” a former Apple engineer told the Financial Times, speaking on Apple’s Indian operations in 2023. Apple’s 2025–2026 increase in Indian manufacturing will be a test of whether that situation has changed and by how much.\nAnd despite this expansion being an effort to partially extricate Apple from its reliance on China, the expansion itself will rely heavily on Chinese workers. “You need the expertise from China,” says Singh. “Chinese engineers and other people, they have to come and setup the [production] lines.”\nBut this in turn could become a roadblock for Apple, if the Chinese government looks unfavorably on the company’s accelerating shift toward India. “I think the geopolitical pressures between India and China is the only limiting factor,” says Singh.\nYou Can’t Escape China\nOne reason China may not object is the nature of the production going on in India. At Apple’s Indian facilities, iPhone casings are made, and iPhones are assembled from already produced components.\nThis is not the highest value, the highest tech, form of manufacturing, the pinnacle of which—in consumer technology at least—is semiconductor fabrication. That’s the creation of processor chips. The Apple A18 series chipsets found in the iPhone 16 family devices are made by Taiwan’s TSMC, one of the most important companies in the world.\nBut the prospect of phone chipsets being produced in India remains a far-away one. “That's another five to 10 years away,” says Singh, of Indian semiconductor fabrication. “That's not a near-future thing. It's a medium- to longer-term kind of thing … They've already started, but it will take some time. So majority of the high-value components will still come from China.”\nShifting iPhone assembly to India is a solution to Apple’s tariff problem, but it is not a solution to Apple’s China problem. And it might be argued that that problem only truly begins if China invades Taiwan.\nWhile TSMC operates fabrication plants in Japan, China, and the US (in Arizona) alongside its many Taiwan locations, the Taiwanese government has asserted the most advanced fabrication technology will stay within Taiwan. This is yet another point of geopolitical tension, though. Previously, TSMC’s fabricators outside of the country were only permitted to produce chipsets two generations behind the latest. However, in January 2025, Taiwan’s minister of economic affairs, J.W.

Ready to pay $2,949 for a base storage iPhone 17 Pro Max?</p><p class=\"paywall\">Apple’s supposed shifting of its manufacturing to India is an insurance policy against such chaos in the future, but it did not begin here. In December 2024, we wrote about <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/india-could-be-apple-and-samsungs-solution-to-the-future-of-phones/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s growing reliance on India</a> for manufacturing as a bulwark against growing US-China tensions.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Indian production of iPhones commenced in 2017, starting with the lower-cost iPhone SE. The country began producing flagship-model launch iPhones in 2023.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">Despite being the better part of a decade into Indian iPhone manufacturing, this latest alleged shift in strategy still represents a very costly turbocharging of its efforts—and likely at least a doubling of output from Apple’s Indian production plants. WIRED approached Apple for comment, but had not received a response at time of publishing.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">How Many Indian iPhones?</h2><p class=\"paywall\">“Our estimates say that Apple produced around 40 to 43 million [iPhones] in India last year,” says Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. “About 12 or 13 million were consumed in the India market entirely, and the rest were exported out.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">More than 60 million iPhones are sold in the US each year, where the series commands a 57 percent smartphone market share, according to some estimates. \"So about 80 to 85 million [iPhones] they will need to produce in India,” says Singh, should Apple want to satisfy US demand at current levels while also serving local Indian market demand.</p><p class=\"paywall\">This expansion does not solely rely on Apple’s investments. As in all of Apple’s major production efforts, any Indian expansion will involve partners, primarily Tata Electronics, Foxconn, and Pegatron.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“Tata is completely running at capacity right now,” says Singh. Tata is the primary force behind Indian iPhone manufacture at present. It operates an assembly plant in Tamil Nadu, in the country’s south. It acquired Wistron’s iPhone-manufacturing Karnataka facility in 2023 and, in January 2025, closed on a majority 60 percent stake in Taiwanese company Pegatron’s Indian operation.</p><p class=\"paywall\">This in turn represents a consolidation of Indian iPhone production being stewarded by an Indian company, Tata Electronics. Foxconn, Pegatron, and Wistron are all Taiwanese companies, despite their global reach and importance.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Trouble at the Factory</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Apple’s Tata-led production has not been entirely smooth.

    "content_text": "The startup Slate Auto officially emerged from stealth mode late Thursday evening to debut its compact electric pickup truck. The company, which is partially backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, says it will sell the most basic version of its EV truck for about $25,000. That’s $5,000 less than the cheapest EVs on sale now in the US, none of which are pickups.\nSlate has been keeping details about its EVs under wraps, though some models have recently been spotted in the wild by sleuths or outright teased by the upstart automaker. Now we have a wealth of information about the trucks’ capabilities, Slate’s manufacturing process, and the EVs’ rollout plans.\nThe basic “Blank Slate” pickup that sells for that lowest price tag gets an estimated 150 miles of range from a 52.7-kilowatt-hour battery pack. It comes in only one color, a gray tone that’s molded into its composite body panels, and offers only a single option: a larger 84.3-kWh battery that gives it an estimated 240 miles of range. (Slate did not quote a price for the larger battery option.)\nThe company is now taking refundable $50 deposits for the pickup trucks, with first deliveries targeted for the last quarter of 2026. Slate says the vehicles will be manufactured at an as-yet-unannounced site in the Midwestern US, a move which allows it to sidestep many of the country's new import tariffs.\nSlate CEO Chris Barman says that both the product and its production process have been designed from the outset to keep costs low. In an interview with WIRED, she says the decision to make just one single model of pickup truck allows Slate to build the EVs more efficiently by eliminating the complexity of multiple variants—including colors. “Not having metal stamping presses [for large body panels] and a paint shop saved Slate $350 million to $500 million,” she says. Barman’s numbers are based on a projected scale of up to 150,000 vehicles a year.\nLow Price, DIY Accessories\nIt’s possible, however, that no two Slates on the roads will be identical. The company is stressing that the vehicles will allow for “accessible personalization.” This is partly to appeal to younger buyers, who have been shown by surveys to be much more open to purchasing EVs than older buyers, and who also may be more eager to trick out their truck.\nThe $25K starting price is low, but Slate will offer more than 100 accessories—sold individually and in bundles—that buyers can install themselves or have installed by their Slate distributor for a set fee. Slate expects its average buyer to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on these accessories, with the higher costs for those who want to convert two-seat pickups into five-seat SUVs.\nThe new automaker expects the two accessory kits that contain new body panels and roll structure, delivered in a flat pack, to be very popular. They let the owner convert the two-door pickup into a two-door SUV or a fastback utility vehicle. The rear wall of the pickup cab is designed to unbolt so it can be reused as the SUV’s tailgate. Required airbags for rear-seat passengers are built into the added roll cage that must be installed—with electronic sensors confirming its connection—before the newly converted Slate will restart. The target prices for each of these conversion kits is around $5,000, Barman says.\nThe rest of the Slate is stripped down, but the CEO says it will contain all required equipment to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for model year 2027. It will have standard automatic emergency braking, for example, and the mandatory backup camera—the view of which is displayed in the driver’s digital instrument cluster, because there’s no central touchscreen. Instead of a built-in screen, Slate offers a variety of phone and tablet mounts.\nOther accessories include a console between the seats, kits to convert the standard manual window winders to electric systems, various seat covers, vehicle wraps, and of course various wheel styles to replace the standard 17-inch, five-lug steel wheels. Slate plans to produce a “Builder’s Book” to show buyers how to modify and personalize their vehicles.\nBasic EV Powertrain, Basic Truck Style\nBarman says the battery cells, using a nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry, will be supplied by Korean maker SK-On from a US production plant. They will power a single 150-kilowatt (201-horsepower) motor powering the rear wheels. All-wheel drive isn’t offered. An onboard AC charger is capable of delivering up to 11 kW, with DC fast-charging up to 120 kW. The NACS connector will be standard.\nThe Blank Slate will have a curb weight of 3,600 pounds, with a payload capacity of 1,430 pounds. Rated towing capacity is listed at 1,000 pounds—significantly less than the 4,000-pound maximum towing capacity in the new 2025 Ford Maverick Hybrid AWD, which has a smaller cargo bed but four doors for the larger cab.\nVisually, the Slate follows the upright, horizontal, square-edged profile of the classic two-seat American pickup truck—though rendered in miniature when compared to the full-size US pickups from Ford, GM, and Ram that collectively sell almost 3 million units per year. It looks something like a retro Ford Ranger from the 1980s, versus the more car-like styling of the Hyundai Santa Cruz, the only other small pickup offered in the US besides the Ford Maverick.\nDimensionally, the Slate is smaller than the Maverick: It’s 175 inches long, 71 inches wide (not including the mirrors), and 69 inches tall. That compares to the Maverick’s 200-inch length, 73-inch width (again without mirrors), and 68- or 69-inch height. Slate offers a full 60-inch (5-foot) bed, versus the Maverick’s 54 inches. (Both measurements are with the tailgate raised.) While the Maverick has no front trunk (it has an engine instead), the Slate’s front trunk offers 7 cubic feet of storage on top of the 37 cubic feet in the cargo bed (or 34 cubic feet in the SUV’s load bay).\nCustomer Satisfaction\nBarman said Slate will target retail buyers to establish the brand and get as many personalized trucks on the road as possible to boost public awareness. Slate’s EVs will also be sold to corporate customers purchasing the vehicles for fleets, Barman says, though she declined to offer a breakdown of what percentages of sales Slate estimates will go to those two sectors.\nWe also didn’t talk about this, but it’s worth mentioning: Slate trucks may conceivably also be sold to Amazon. The connection makes sense, since Slate Auto emerged from a startup lab partially funded by Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos. The online retailer already deploys tens of thousands of Rivian EV delivery vans, but a smaller EV could serve its purposes for specific uses as well.\nEchoes of the Past\nAs Mark Twain once quipped, perhaps apocryphally: History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Anyone who’s been following the auto business for about 20 years may have read Slate’s news and sensed a faint echo, a distant and long-forgotten memory tugging at the corners of their minds.\nThat would be V-Vehicles (later renamed NextAuto), a low-cost vehicle startup backed by famed venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, Caufield & Byers; a few of its Silicon Valley cohorts; and Texas natural-gas magnate T. Boone Pickens. The company’s intent was to create an ultra-low-cost, lightweight 40-mpg “V-Car” to be manufactured at a former headlight plant in Monroe, Louisiana. Buyers could wrap its white molded plastic body panels in any color they desired. It would be built from off-the-shelf parts and sold through a big-box store like Sam’s Club, with a single stock number for simplicity.\nThe V-Car was not a battery-electric vehicle; Pickens’ participation pushed it toward natural-gas fueling. But the business model required startup funding from the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing loan program to convert its plant. Ford, Nissan, and Tesla all received those loans in 2009—shortly followed by Fisker. When the DOE turned down the V-Vehicle ATVM loan application in May 2010, the company’s fate was sealed.\nKleiner made two other automotive investments: Fisker Automotive and Think North America, a 2009 effort to manufacture the plastic-paneled, two-seat Norwegian Think electric car in the US. None of those companies exist today.\nHere’s hoping that Slate—whose little electric truck is an appealing size for many and seems affordable, especially to those without a burning desire to personalize their ride—fares somewhat better.",

    "content_text": "Automakers and tech developers testing and deploying self-driving and advanced driver-assistance features will no longer have to report as much detailed, public crash information to the federal government, according to a new framework released today by the US Department of Transportation.\nThe moves are a boon for makers of self-driving cars and the wider vehicle technology industry, which has complained that federal crash-reporting requirements are overly burdensome and redundant. But the new rules will limit the information available to those who watchdog and study autonomous vehicles and driver-assistance features—tech developments that are deeply entwined with public safety but which companies often shield from public view because they involve proprietary systems that companies spend billions to develop.\nThe government's new orders limit “one of the only sources of publicly available data that we have on incidents involving Level 2 systems,” says Sam Abuelsamid, who writes about the self-driving-vehicle industry and is the vice president of marketing at Telemetry, a Michigan research firm, referring to driver-assistance features such as Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised), General Motors’ Super Cruise, and Ford’s Blue Cruise. These incidents, he notes, are only becoming “more common.”\nThe new rules allow companies to shield from public view some crash details, including the automation version involved in incidents and the “narratives” around the crashes, on the grounds that such information contains “confidential business information.” Self-driving-vehicle developers, such as Waymo and Zoox, will no longer need to report crashes that include property damage less than $1,000, if the incident doesn’t involve the self-driving car crashing on its own or striking another vehicle or object. (This may nix, for example, federal public reporting on some minor fender-benders in which a Waymo is struck by another car. But companies will still have to report incidents in California, which has more stringent regulations around self-driving.)\nAnd in a change, the makers of advanced driver-assistance features, such as Full Self-Driving, must report crashes only if they result in fatalities, hospitalizations, air bag deployments, or a strike on a \"vulnerable road user,” like a pedestrian or cyclist—but no longer have to report the crash if the vehicle involved just needs to be towed.\n“This does seem to close the door on a huge number of additional reports,” says William Wallace, who directs safety advocacy for Consumer Reports. “It’s a big carve-out.” The changes move in the opposite direction of what his organization has championed: federal rules that fight against a trend of \"significant incident underreporting\" among the makers of advanced vehicle tech.\nThe new DOT framework will also allow automakers to test self-driving technology with more vehicles that don’t meet all federal safety standards under a new exemption process. That process, which is currently used for foreign vehicles imported into the US but is now being expanded to domestically made ones, will include an \"iterative review” that \"considers the overall safety of the vehicle.” The process can be used to, for example, more quickly approve vehicles that don’t come with steering wheels, brake pedals, rearview mirrors, or other typical safety features that make less sense when cars are driven by computers.\nOne company in particular emerges as a winner: Elon Musk’s Tesla, which now will be able to curtail public reporting on its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (Supervised) features, and may enjoy an easier road to federal safety approval for its upcoming Cybercab, a two-seat, purpose-built robotaxi that does not have a steering wheel or brakes.\n“The company that probably benefits the most from that is Tesla,” Abuelsamid says. Though the Transportation Department cited safety as the number one motivator behind the new rules, “there’s nothing in these changes that actually prioritizes safety,” he says.\nA spokesperson for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not respond to questions about Tesla. Tesla, which disbanded its press team five years ago, did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn a video message posted to X, DOT secretary Sean Duffy said the new automated vehicle framework aimed to increase commercial deployment of new car technology. “America is in the middle of an innovation race with China, and the stakes couldn’t be higher,” he said.\nIn a memo, an NHTSA official said the changes were only the first step in an effort to \"improve the efficiency and effectiveness” of the process through which new vehicle tech is allowed on roads.\nVehicle industry groups applauded the changes. The Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association, an organization that represents several autonomous vehicle technology companies (though, notably, not Tesla) called the DOT’s announcement a “bold and necessary step in developing a federal policy framework for autonomous vehicles.” John Bozzella, the president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an automotive trade organization, said the announcement is “a signal that AV policy in America isn’t an afterthought anymore.”\nThe changes to the program are not as drastic as some safety advocates had feared. Prior to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Reuters reported that the transition team considered scrapping all government crash-reporting requirements related to self-driving and advanced vehicle technology. Though this week’s changes curtail some of the data released and eliminate some redundancies that made the data more difficult to understand and handle, companies deploying self-driving cars are still required to report crash information to the feds.\nNoah Goodall, an independent researcher who studies autonomous vehicles, says the changes may make it harder for outsiders to spot or understand patterns in self-driving vehicles’ mistakes—though also notes the public database on crashes has been difficult to work with since it was launched in 2021. “You’re getting less reporting now,” he says. “From my perspective, more data is good.”",

But the new rules will limit the information available to those who watchdog and study autonomous vehicles and driver-assistance features—tech developments that are deeply entwined with public safety but which companies often shield from public view because they involve proprietary systems that companies spend billions to develop.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The government's <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2025-04/third-amended-SGO-2021-01_2025.pdf\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2025-04/third-amended-SGO-2021-01_2025.pdf\" href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2025-04/third-amended-SGO-2021-01_2025.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new orders</a> limit “one of the only sources of publicly available data that we have on incidents involving Level 2 systems,” says Sam Abuelsamid, who writes about the self-driving-vehicle industry and is the vice president of marketing at Telemetry, a Michigan research firm, referring to driver-assistance features such as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/tesla/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cybertruck-finally-gets-full-self-driving-supervised/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Full Self-Driving (Supervised)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/general-motors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">General Motors</a>’ <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/general-motors-cuts-funding-to-cruise-robotaxis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Super Cruise</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/ford/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ford</a>’s Blue Cruise. These incidents, he notes, are only becoming “more common.”</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">The new rules allow companies to shield from public view some crash details, including the automation version involved in incidents and the “narratives” around the crashes, on the grounds that such information contains “confidential business information.” Self-driving-vehicle developers, such as Waymo and Zoox, will no longer need to report crashes that include property damage less than $1,000, if the incident doesn’t involve the self-driving car crashing on its own or striking another vehicle or object. (This may nix, for example, federal public reporting on some minor fender-benders in which a Waymo is struck by another car. But companies will still have to report incidents in California, which has more stringent regulations around self-driving.)</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">And in a change, the makers of advanced driver-assistance features, such as Full Self-Driving, must report crashes only if they result in fatalities, hospitalizations, air bag deployments, or a strike on a \"vulnerable road user,” like a pedestrian or cyclist—but no longer have to report the crash if the vehicle involved just needs to be towed.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“This does seem to close the door on a huge number of additional reports,” says William Wallace, who directs safety advocacy for Consumer Reports. “It’s a big carve-out.” The changes move in the opposite direction of what his organization has championed: federal rules that fight against a trend of \"significant incident underreporting\" among the makers of advanced vehicle tech.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The new DOT framework will also allow automakers to test self-driving technology with more vehicles that don’t meet all federal safety standards under a new exemption process. That process, which is currently used for foreign vehicles imported into the US but is now being expanded to domestically made ones, will include an \"iterative review” that \"considers the overall safety of the vehicle.” The process can be used to, for example, more quickly approve vehicles that don’t come with steering wheels, brake pedals, rearview mirrors, or other typical safety features that make less sense when cars are driven by computers.</p></div></div></body></html>",

I am so happy to be back. My brain barely works. That's how great the trip was. We had a fantastic time. We did travel internationally. I took my family on a really fantastic vacation.\nLauren Goode: What vibes did you get from people outside of the US about the US?\nKatie Drummond: It's interesting. If they were dealing with me or my child, I have a very cute child, they were lovely. I speak French. Look, I was in France. I don't know why I'm trying to conceal this. I have already come back. So I think that helped a lot. My husband, I'm married to someone who's very loud, and so he gives very American energy, and they didn't love that. But I don't know how much of that is just like loud man versus like, “Ugh, loud American.” You know what I mean? Depending on which member of the family we're talking about, I think experiences differ. But I did great.\nMichael Calore: I remember going to France during the George W. Bush administration, and I would tell people I'm from California. I wouldn't say I'm from the United States. I'd say I'm from California. And then they would express sympathy toward me. They would say, “Oh, I'm so sorry.” They were very, very aware that California was politically left from the rest of the country.\nKatie Drummond: That's a smart tactical move.\nLauren Goode: It's probably more extreme now.\nMichael Calore: Yes, probably. Well, let's get on with the show, because today we are talking about travel, specifically international travel. Katie, you've inspired us. We're going to talk about how to protect yourself from phone searches when you're crossing the border into the US. This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nKatie Drummond: And I'm Katie Drummond, WIRED's global editorial director.\nMichael Calore: Travel to the US is getting dicey. With travel warnings being issued, customs and border protection cracking down on people, and President Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies, many people are reevaluating their travel to the US or abandoning their travel plans altogether.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, there's a lot happening, and last week on the show we did an episode, sort of similar, about surveillance and protests and how to stay safe if you decide to take to the streets, exercise your First Amendment rights. We had a lot of good tips in that episode on safety, including what to do with your smartphone, how to protect your personal information. This week we are really homing in on the phone, and we're talking specifically about what to do when you go through customs.\nMichael Calore: So this is the second part of a two-parter, we could say.\nLauren Goode: That's right, and we should give a lot of credit, by the way, to our security team here at WIRED, our security desk, because they've been doing a fantastic job reporting on all of this.\nMichael Calore: Yes, and there are several pieces that you should read on WIRED.com right now if you are traveling internationally. We'll of course link to all of them in the show notes, or you can just go to WIRED.com They're close to the top of the page. So let's start this conversation with the basics. What do we need to know about how phones are searched at the border when you're coming into the United States?\nKatie Drummond: Well, I think the most important thing for people to realize, the very basic premise, which I think can be surprising, is that when you come into the United States, whether you're a US citizen or a visa holder or just a tourist, is that Customs and Border Patrol, so when you clear Customs at an airport or you're driving over the border between the US and Canada, that they do actually have the authority to ask to search your phone when you enter the country. That is within their rights, which I actually think, until the last several months, if you haven't been paying close attention to border security and how we travel, you're just an everyday traveler, you might actually not be aware of. So I think that's the foundation of this entire conversation is that, yeah, they can ask to take your phone.\nLauren Goode: Right. And that can happen in other countries too.\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nKatie Drummond: Absolutely.\nLauren Goode: Not just the US. So when you're traveling internationally, it's part of the deal, and it has been, but there's a lot of attention on this right now.\nMichael Calore: So it feels like new information even though it's not new information, because I think most people would assume that if you're a US citizen, and even though you're in the border, you're standing in San Francisco or you're standing in New York City, you would have the protection of the Fourth Amendment, which protects you against unlawful search and seizure. But the Fourth Amendment works a little bit differently in certain parts of the country.\nLauren Goode: Right. But then when you're at the airport, you're in a border zone, so all bets are off.\nKatie Drummond: Well wait, sorry. Explain what you mean by a border zone. If I am at JFK airport in New York City, I'm in a border zone?\nLauren Goode: That's correct. Basically a hundred miles inland from any border, which includes airports, typically fall outside of the standard Fourth Amendment protections. The Fourth Amendment basically means that if an authority was going to search your device, they'd need a warrant first. But once you are in one of those border zones, basically there's no need for that warrant; customs can search any traveler's phone or electronic device. And that's not just phones. That's your iPad, it's your laptop, it's cameras, it's any electronic device.\nMichael Calore: Your iPod.\nLauren Goode: Sure. For those of us carrying vintage iPods, that might be the way to go. Now it's just carry an iPod.\nMichael Calore: Well, it gets to an important point, which is what types of things are they looking for when they search a device?\nKatie Drummond: I think the answer to that question has actually changed a lot as far as we can tell in just the last few months. Ostensibly, and I think the way this has typically worked as far as we are aware, is that they would be looking for potential terrorist activity, criminal activity. The majority of these searches, at least last year, were on non-US citizens. They're looking for people coming into the country who have the potential or the intention of committing criminal acts inside the United States. I think, though, that in this era, in everything we have seen so far with travelers being searched or detained or even denied entry into the United States, there is an overarching sense that border patrol officials are actually looking for something a little bit different. Even expressing your dislike for the Trump administration seems to be enough to cause you pretty serious problems at the border.\nLauren Goode: What's concerning about what's happening right now is it's hard to say exactly why certain people are being targeted or detained at the border. In the past there was this understanding that maybe someone might be targeted for suspicion of terrorist or criminal activity, but now it just seems like anyone who is potentially deemed antagonistic in some way to the Trump administration, whether that's an academic doing a certain type of research or a journalist reporting critically on the administration or a student activist, a protester, it's just unclear what is going to be the thing that is getting you denied entry to the US. And there have been certain examples, like in March, a French scientist was denied entry to the US. There's also a story of a Wall Street Journal journalist returning from Beirut who was detained and searched after customs realized she had traveled to dangerous places. She did not allow them to search her phone. But that's one example of a journalist from a very established, reputable outlet being detained.\nKatie Drummond: One of the pieces of all of this in the last few months that has made it so difficult is that the press is reporting on these isolated incidents, like a scientist here, a journalist there, a tourist here, but there is not a codified or any sort of institutional guidance from the Trump administration about any new policies at the border, anything specific that they are now looking for or targeting. It all feels still very anecdotal, certainly anecdotal enough and common enough to be very scary, but there isn't one prevailing trend that we can point to. It's a diffuse range of very disturbing stories that are showing up in news outlets. It is a little tough to figure out exactly what's going on, how methodical it is, how systematic it is.\nWe have been obviously covering the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, quite a bit, and one of the major efforts they appear to be undertaking is an attempt to pull data from all of these different federal agencies into one readily accessible database. So they want to be able to access a whole range of information about a given person in one place. And my suspicion, and I think what we have reported, is that that information, let's say they have a bunch of information about me in one place in some sort of database, all of a sudden if that information is then tied to whatever border security is looking at, it allows them to basically systematically start targeting people at borders, which is a very scary prospect. Sounds very far-flung, dystopian, but I think it’s actually closer to becoming a reality than we might assume.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: I don't think it's far-flung at all. Honestly, I think that reality is here.\nKatie Drummond: Well, two years ago it would sound a little nuts.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, it would. And I think there's this feeling right now that if you end up in that position where someone wants to pull you aside and search your phone, and they're presenting you with this “Enter your passcode” or they're probably stern about it, there's probably this sense of no one can help you now. Who's going to help you? You're going to say, “I would like to talk to a lawyer,” or “No, you can't search my device,” or “Sure, you can search my device, but when am I getting it back and what are you doing with that information?” You're just going to be in that moment. And so the best thing you can do is arm yourself with all the information you need in advance, and also just take the steps that we're about to talk about.\nMichael Calore: And also I think we should quickly outline what happens in that situation, in that scenario. A Customs and Border Protection agent can ask you to open your phone, either using face ID or a fingerprint or by entering your PIN. So when somebody says, “Will you unlock your phone for me?” at the border, what they can do is they can search it manually. And that's what happens in most cases. They'll open up various apps, they'll look at things, they'll scroll through. They don't just pick up and start scrolling through all your Twitter messages, but they will look at your social media accounts, they'll look at emails, they'll look at contacts. Whatever they're looking for, they will have access to the phone to look for.\nIn some cases, it can involve an electronic search where they hook your phone up to a machine and it sucks all the information off of your phone and then they can do more complex data analysis on it. But what you should know is that if you're a US citizen, or if you're a green card holder, you can refuse to have your device searched at the border without being denied entry into the United States. You can have your phone confiscated, you can be brought into a little room and asked more questions. You will be scrutinized if you deny them the opportunity to search your phone, but they can't keep you from entering the country under normal circumstances.\nKatie Drummond: I think even just listening to you outline all of that out loud is very helpful. That is such an invasive prospect, and such a terrifying prospect too. Lauren, what you were saying a minute ago about you're talking to a stranger, they're in uniform, they're very stern, they are essentially blocking you from entering the country where potentially you are just visiting or potentially where you have a home. So much personal, private information is on this device, and I think, just even imagining what it would feel like to be taken to a small room in an airport with a very mean person who's looking at your email, that's a really daunting thought and a really daunting prospect, and I think that just underlines how important it is to be prepared before you go to the airport, before you travel. Even to practice. I'll talk a little bit later about what I did to get ready for this trip, but it involved practicing. I did dry runs in my head of how I would handle different situations, and I think that's a really important thing, journalists or not, for anyone to be doing right now.\nLauren Goode: And that's the best-case scenario, if you're a US citizen. You can decline the search. You can still be allowed in. They might take your device, you might get it back at a later point, right?\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: If you're a visa holder or a foreign visitor and you refuse, you can be detained or deported.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, they can say, “Well then, we're not going to let you into the country. You need to go talk to those people and they'll help you fly home.”\nLauren Goode: Right.\nMichael Calore: We're going to take a quick break, and when we come back we'll talk about what you can do to prepare your phone and your devices to cross the border.\n[brea]\nMichael Calore: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. Let's talk about what folks can do to feel safe and to protect themselves when traveling into the US. What is the first thing that we want to recommend?\nLauren Goode: Ahead of the traveling part, ahead of considering using a burner phone or a second phone or something like that, we should just talk about the type of apps that you're using, and particularly for messaging. This is very familiar for journalists already. We all use it, and of course now I think this has more brand awareness at a national level now because of Signalgate, which we've talked about before. But you should be using encrypted messaging, and an app like Signal in particular has a disappearing messages function, so that after a certain period of time—you can set it to be a day, a week, a month, whatever it is—those messages will disappear. They're untraceable at that point, to the best of our knowledge. And so even ahead of a trip like that, you should be thinking about, are my accounts locked down? What do I have backed up to the cloud? Am I using truly encrypted messaging apps? Basically, you should have a good sense of digital hygiene, privacy hygiene, before you've even gotten to the border.\nKatie Drummond: Yeah, I think it's a good question to ask yourself. If you're spending time trash-talking the president and the administration with your dad, should you really be doing that on iMessage? For journalists, I think we often think about Signal and encrypted messaging as a way to communicate with sources, and of course it's a very valuable tool for that, but this extends to all of the texting that you do with everyone in your life.\nAnd even for me, I would just say anecdotally, Mike and Lauren, I don't know about you guys, but a few months ago I actually had my family and all of my close friends start using Signal to text with me. I stopped using iMessage to text with them just because I don't want those personal interactions and off-the-cuff comments that everybody makes to be visible in any way. So it does suck when I go look at my family text group and I can't read anything that we sent yesterday. We've lost some very valuable and hilarious Drummond family jokes as a result, but it's worth it, because that long trail of conversation, just those very casual chats that you have during the day, are not visible to any prying eyes.\nMichael Calore: So if you're traveling into the US, through an airport or across a border, and you want to protect your device in the instance that somebody asks to search it, here are some things that you can do. You should disable biometrics on your phone. Turn off Face ID, or whatever face unlock feature you have if you have an Android phone, turn off fingerprint unlock, and only use a PIN.\nKatie Drummond: Can I interject here very quickly, Mike?\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nKatie Drummond: I do not understand for the life of me, truly, outside of even the context of travel, why anyone would be using Face ID to unlock their phone. It feels like such a high-risk move, that it's like, it's really that hard to remember four numbers? You want your face to be able to unlock your phone? Are you nuts? Are you nuts?\nMichael Calore: Well, Katie, just to interject on your interjection, you should be using a six-number PIN instead of a four-number PIN.\nKatie Drummond: Oh, my God. Hold on. I got to look at how many numbers my password is. Hold on. Oh, no, it's six. It's six. It's six. I relent.\nMichael Calore: But convenience. Convenience.\nKatie Drummond: No.\nMichael Calore: Human beings have been trading privacy for convenience—\nKatie Drummond: I know, I know.\nMichael Calore: —for—\nLauren Goode: I know.\nMichael Calore: —millennia.\nKatie Drummond: Convenience is one of technology's most dangerous offerings.\nMichael Calore: And the convenience narrative is real, though. We all really enjoy—\nKatie Drummond: It is, of course.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nKatie Drummond: —those conveniences that technology has brought us, but if you want the ultimate security—\nLauren Goode: That's right.\nMichael Calore: —turn that shit off. Just in case anybody's wondering why you would want to turn it off, if somebody has your phone, they can just hold it up to your face and unlock it, or they can put you in handcuffs and then use your fingerprint to unlock your phone. Whereas if they need a PIN, you can say the helpful words, “I can't help you with that, officer.”\nLauren Goode: Is that how you would say it, in that tone? I just want to—\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: Have you practiced that?\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nKatie Drummond: That's how he practices.\nMichael Calore: Because you don't want to say, “I forgot,” because then you might be lying.\nLauren Goode: That's right.\nMichael Calore: You might be caught in a lie. You can just say, “I can't help you with that, officer.” Helpful tips on talking to cops here on Uncanny Valley.\nKatie Drummond: That is actually a very helpful tip. That's good.\nMichael Calore: Something else you can do: update your operating system.\nLauren Goode: That's right.\nMichael Calore: Make sure it's fully up-to-date.\nLauren Goode: That's right. You know when you go to the notes for OS updates and it will say—\nMichael Calore: Known security blah blah blah blah.\nLauren Goode: —known security issues, fixes, bugs, and security issues? Security issues is key here. Pretty much every major operating system update is patching some vulnerability, fixing some flaws in security, and so you want the latest.\nMichael Calore: And law enforcement has technological tools that can exploit those vulnerabilities in order to gain access to your phone. So by updating your phone, you are rendering their tools ineffective.\nLauren Goode: Keep it going.\nMichael Calore: Turn off your phone and put it in your luggage when you're in the airport or when you're approaching border patrol. If it's out of sight, it may make it more difficult for somebody to be reminded that they should be checking your phone. It's just a small thing you can do. Something much bigger you can do: print your boarding pass. Do what Katie does and go fully analog.\nLauren Goode: Yep.\nKatie Drummond: I always ... The first thing I do when I get to the airport, what is it? I print my boarding pass.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: Right.\nLauren Goode: I do, too, actually.\nMichael Calore: And the point here is that you don't want to have to open your phone at all if you don't have to. So we should talk about who should be doing this. We mentioned that US citizens and people who hold green cards are more safe in border zones than folks who are here on a visa or some sort of noncitizen status, but should everybody be doing this?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, this is a good question. A lot of this is going to depend on your own personal risk factor. We've already talked about the difference between being a US citizen or a green card holder versus being a visa holder or a foreign visitor. I hate that we're at this point, I hate that I'm saying this, but you should also factor in things like your nationality or your profession.\nKatie Drummond: I'll take this one step further and just say the very provocative thing, which I think, race and sexuality and gender identity are also big pieces of this, unfortunately.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nKatie Drummond: That has been a real thing for a very long time. I think it is even more real now. If you are a middle-aged white man with a US passport traveling in a suit with a briefcase, that is a very different scenario than a person of color who identifies as queer and is crossing the border into the United States. It is just different, and it shouldn't be, but it is.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, and I think if you particularly are somebody who's outspoken in communities that have proven to have been targeted by the Trump administration in recent months, like if you are an active member of the trans rights community, if you're active in pro-Gaza groups, then those are things that, if your phone was searched, they could learn about on your phone. So if you have queer dating apps on your phone, if you belong to a bunch of organizations that send you email newsletters that are particularly leftist, those may be things that you would want to hide from anybody who wants to search your phone.\nKatie Drummond: To offer the furthest extreme point of view on this question that you asked, which is who should be thinking about this and acting on it when they're traveling, look, my view is everybody. Because I think that these are relatively simple steps. There is an inconvenience to some of what we are recommending, but we are in an unprecedented moment in this country. There is so much that we do not know about what is happening behind the scenes about how these decisions are being made, about what's possible at the border and with border security, that my feeling is very, very, very, very, very much better safe than sorry. For the vast majority of people, it is incredibly unlikely that their devices will be seized, that anything will happen, but why take the risk?\nSure, there are risk factors that you can consider when you're deciding how extreme to go. Do you bring a burner phone and leave your phone at home? Do you just delete certain apps from your phone? There are different levels of intensity that you can take this in, but I think it would be incredibly naive for anyone at this moment in time to just treat this all as business as usual. This is not business as usual in this country right now.\nLauren Goode: And if it sounds like we're flailing about or casting a very wide net of who could potentially be targeted by this, it's because we don't actually know—\nKatie Drummond: True.\nLauren Goode: —and it's my belief that this is actually what the administration may want. There is a method to the chaos, and it is actually to instill the fear that we are all experiencing at this moment and forcing us to take these measures, because it is completely unprecedented for us, I think for many of us.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, agreed. Well, let's fight the fear by going extremely hardcore into safety territory, because we've talked about the first option, which is turn off these things on your phone. What else should people be doing with their phones? Do we delete apps? Do we hide apps in specific folders? And I have some thoughts about this. I think that you may just be better off, if you're really worried about crossing the border, you may be better off just starting over with a new phone. You set up a separate phone just for travel where you have absolute minimum amount of stuff that you need on it before you cross the border.\nLauren Goode: Right. Yeah, and Lily and Matt, our colleagues who wrote the guide to this, they talk about a burner phone but also make the clarification that this is not a burner phone that you go to the corner store and you buy with cash and it doesn't have any apps on it. It's just like a … What are the old things … The flip phones.\nMichael Calore: Flip phones, yes.\nLauren Goode: Oh my gosh, yes.\nMichael Calore: What are those things called? Yes, Lauren.\nLauren Goode: I know, because I'm just so young. I don't know what a flip phone is. You can use a smartphone, but it's a secondary smartphone that you're building from scratch. You're installing only the apps you need. You're not putting sensitive information or messages or accounts on there. You may even be using a different phone number so that your main phone number is not … Because that can actually be tied to a bunch of digital services. And so you can still use a smartphone if you're traveling, is the thinking, but you're starting from a clean slate.\nMichael Calore: Katie, is this what you did?\nKatie Drummond: I did, actually. And I will add, I think a couple pieces of context. One is that I'm a journalist. WIRED has been publishing a lot about the administration, so there's a certain risk assessment that goes into that. And then I would also add that I have the benefit of working for a big company who, because of my job, I was able to say, “Hey, I'm traveling internationally. I don't want to bring my computer. I don't want to bring my phone.” And they were able to provide me with clean devices, and it definitely took some getting used to. It was hard to be separated from my devices, which are what I spend most of my time with, sadly.\nMichael Calore: Yeah honestly, this is the hardest part about giving this advice, because people say, “Well, what can I do to be safe?” And we say, “Leave your phone at home, go out and purchase a second phone or borrow a second phone, and put absolute minimum amount of stuff on it.” Like you said, everybody has to have their phone on them at all times, and that is not what anybody wants to hear when they ask that question.\nKatie Drummond: And I will say, though, as I mentioned earlier, I was traveling with my very loud American husband, and our risk profiles are a little bit different for lots of reasons. He traveled with his phone, but he went through it and he deleted a bunch of apps. He logged out of all of his social media. He communicates using Signal as well. So he took a more measured approach. The idea of us going out and buying him a second iPhone, that sounds crazy. That's a lot of money to spend.\nMichael Calore: So did he just log out of social media apps, or did he delete the apps from his phone?\nKatie Drummond: I believe he logged out and deleted the apps. He just wanted to travel with as clean a slate as possible. He backed a bunch of stuff up, and then just deleted it off of his hardware.\nMichael Calore: And that's the correct approach for social media. You want to log out of the app and delete it from your phone. Even if you delete the apps off of your phone and they know who you are, so they can look up and see that you have a social media presence online, they may turn a laptop towards you and compel you to log into your social media accounts, right there on the spot on a different device. In which case, it's very important that you have two-factor authentication turned on, and that the device that you use for two-factor authentication is the one that you left at home.\nLauren Goode: Right.\nMichael Calore: It's not the one that you're traveling internationally with.\nLauren Goode: Right, right.\nKatie Drummond: That's a really interesting point. I feel like that's very smart-in-the-weeds guidance. Mike, here is a follow-up question: If someone turned a device to you and said, “Log into your X account on this computer,” can you say, “I'm sorry, officer, I can't help you with that”?\nMichael Calore: Yes. And the explanation there, which should be what you actually do so that you're not lying, is that you're using a strong password that is stored in your password manager and that you do not have access to your password manager.\nKatie Drummond: Great answer.\nLauren Goode: Here's maybe a dumb question about social media, but you're describing logging into a Twitter account. They can also just go to your public-facing Twitter account. And in our case, ours are public-facing.\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: And see what you're tweeting, anyway.\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: The next layer would be DMs or something like that, which Border Patrol could get into, but otherwise, anything you're tweeting, anything you're putting on Bluesky, anything you're putting on a public-facing Instagram at this point is fair game, easily searched.\nKatie Drummond: Which I think is really important for folks to keep in mind, particularly people who are here on visas, people who are not US citizens. There is a very, very, very real risk that your public-facing communications, what you put on social media, can be used against you at the border. And I think that that's a great point. There's only so much that logging out and deleting apps will accomplish. I think it is one step up from doing nothing, and so for some people that might be enough to make them feel safe crossing the border if their risk profile is relatively low; but if your risk profile is not relatively low, to Lauren's point, there are some pretty easy ways that Border Patrol can see what you're posting on the internet.\nMichael Calore: One more note about cleaning up what's on your phone. A few people have asked me if it's possible to take the sensitive apps, like let's say your gay dating app or your social media apps, and use that feature in iOS that lets you hide those apps in a folder. And that's useful to keep people from just casually snooping on your phone because they won't see that you have those apps, but it's protected by your Apple ID and it's protected by your PIN, so you can't get into those if you have biometrics turned off. However, people can still see that those apps are on your phone even if you have them in a hidden folder because they can look at your battery usage stats and they can look at your screen time stats and they can see that those apps show up in those lists. So that's why it's important to just delete them off of your phone instead of just hiding them in a hidden folder.\nLauren Goode: That's smart. That's really smart. What do we know about this tool that Border Patrol is using to actually get this data from your phone? Because in the past, and I'm thinking particularly of the example of San Bernardino, when authorities had the shooter's iPhone but were unable to extract the information from messages that they wanted to extract, and so kept going to Apple and saying, “Could you give us access?” And Apple was responding and saying, “We don't even have backdoor access.” What exactly are they able to get from our phones?\nMichael Calore: The sky's the limit. If you can access the phone, if you can get past that PIN, then the sky's the limit.\nLauren Goode: But if it's locked? If it's locked and you said, “I'm sorry, officer, I cannot help you with that,” then exactly what information are they able to get?\nMichael Calore: Not much. Well, before we move on, I have to ask, what do we make of this moment? When we were trying to decide what we were going to talk about on this week's episode, we had to come back to privacy the second week in a row, and it feels like an important decision that we made, and I just want to talk about why we're spending so much time on this.\nLauren Goode: This is all just incredibly disturbing, is what it is. Legal scholars right now, historians are saying that for other reasons, they believe that the US is already in a constitutional crisis, and all of what we're describing here today are activities and actions that could be taken legally, prior to this, at the border, for anyone who was coming through. It was extremely rare that someone would be detained and have their device searched, but the way that this is being done now feels as though it is part of a much bigger picture around people's rights being threatened. The fact that, Mike, even you said earlier, well, if you're using a gay dating app, you might want to hide that. Katie, you brought that up as well with regards to the LGBTQ community feeling vulnerable. The fact that we're talking about academics, professors, scientists, researchers, journalists, people being potentially targeted, to me, it's incredibly disturbing.\nKatie Drummond: I think it's really important to continue to acknowledge, to ourselves, it's a hard thing, I find, to acknowledge to myself, and in our roles as journalists to acknowledge to our audience, to all of you who are listening, we have never been here before. As I said earlier, this is not business as usual in this country. What is happening right now is, to Lauren's point, very disturbing; it is very distressing; and it is very much unknown, and that's not a very safe feeling. There are things about the way we all live that we need to change. The best thing that we can do at WIRED right now is to provide as much of that expertise and information and guidance as we possibly can, even as we're navigating it ourselves in our own personal lives.\nMichael Calore: Very well said. Thank you for that. Let's take another break and we'll come back and have some fun.\n[break]\nMichael Calore: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. So it's been a very dark episode, so let's spread some love and light through the halls, shall we?\nKatie Drummond: Let's do it, Mike.\nLauren Goode: Let's do it.\nMichael Calore: So we asked you to write in, and you have been writing in. Thank you very much for writing in, and we do read your messages, and there's one thing that we want to do because there has been a popular demand for it, and that is to give you our latest recommendations before we end the show. So we're going to talk about some things that we enjoy that you might also enjoy. Who's going to go first? Katie, Lauren?\nLauren Goode: I think Katie should go first. She's the boss.\nKatie Drummond: So as you all know, because I can't stop talking about it, I recently returned from France, and one thing in particular that I am now pathologically fixated on, that I am recommending to all of you, if you want to feel just so good, if you want to just feel so good when you sit down and eat, is French butter. And so I ate so much butter last week. My entire family was obsessed with the butter. All we did was eat butter. We got home over the weekend, I went to a specialty grocery store, and I purchased French butter. And I have now been eating the French butter in the privacy of my own residence, and it's just been a very lovely thing. I got some nice bread, I got my French butter, I'm watching the country fall apart, and I'm very well nourished, and that is my recommendation for the week. Go get some French butter. You will feel so much better after you do.\nLauren Goode: Salted or unsalted?\nKatie Drummond: Salted. As salted as possible.\nLauren Goode: Room temperature?\nKatie Drummond: Oh, yeah. Cold, I would say, cold to room temperature.\nLauren Goode: Cold to room temperature.\nKatie Drummond: You don't want that stuff soft and melted. That's not the energy.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, no. This is so inspirational.\nMichael Calore: That's the only way. That's the only way I eat butter, is soft.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Katie, do you watch Temptation Island while you are having your bread and butter?\nKatie Drummond: I have actually now moved on. I am watching, throwback alert: The Bear.\nLauren Goode: Oh, not stressful at all.\nKatie Drummond: The guy in the show, the main guy, is hot, so I feel like that checks the trash box. He's hot.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, OK. We stan.\nKatie Drummond: Thank you.\nLauren Goode: We do stan.\nMichael Calore: Lauren. Lauren, what's your recommendation?\nLauren Goode: I can't top that.\nMichael Calore: Sure, you can.\nLauren Goode: That share had everything. Jeremy Allen White, butter, reality TV.\nKatie Drummond: It's too late. You should have gone first. Now you have to go second.\nLauren Goode: I'm going to recommend a couple of movies that are about popes.\nMichael Calore: Why?\nLauren Goode: Pope Francis just died on Easter Monday, April 21st. And—\nKatie Drummond: Remind me, Lauren, who did he meet with right before he died? It's just—this is important.\nLauren Goode: I'm trying to think of who it was. Yeah, it was, I think, JD Vance? Was it JD Vance?\nKatie Drummond: Oh, it was JD, yes.\nLauren Goode: That's right. It was JD Vance.\nKatie Drummond: Right. So the Pope met with JD Vance and then died.\nLauren Goode: That is correct.\nKatie Drummond: Thank you. Keep going.\nLauren Goode: I would like to believe Pope Francis was holding on just so he could get one more message, one more scolding across. I actually saw a meme on the internet, of course. What else are we on the internet for these days? That said JD Vance stands for just killed de Pope Vance.\nKatie Drummond: Oh, no.\nMichael Calore: Oh, no.\nKatie Drummond: That's pretty good.\nLauren Goode: I know.\nKatie Drummond: Sorry, that's pretty good.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I'll send it around. We're not going to link to it in the show notes, though, but I happen to have been on a pope kick prior to this. I know that—\nKatie Drummond: Wait, really?\nLauren Goode: Yes, I know that's a weird—\nKatie Drummond: What does it mean to be on a pope kick?\nLauren Goode: It just means—\nKatie Drummond: Don't tell me this is like my Jeremy Allen White kick, Lauren.\nLauren Goode: It just means … So Katie, Katie, this is the moment when I tell you that I'm leaving WIRED to go to divinity school.\nKatie Drummond: Oh no, Lauren.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nMichael Calore: Oh boy.\nLauren Goode: I watched The Conclave a couple of months ago, was fascinated by it. I was messaging with … One of my aunts is a retired religion teacher, and I was messaging with her about it, and she said, “Oh, well, if you liked that, you have to watch Two Popes.” So then I watched Two Popes, which is streaming on Netflix. It's a 2019 movie. Fantastic. I loved it, and I only realized after the fact that it's directed by Fernando Meirelles, who's this incredible Brazilian director. Also directed City of God and the Constant Gardener. That is like the Fernando Meirelles trifecta, by the way. Now I'm just giving you too many recommendations. I recommend the Conclave and Two Popes.\nMichael Calore: But not Young Pope.\nLauren Goode: I think I've seen it, but I can't wholeheartedly recommend it at this moment.\nMichael Calore: It's surreal and weird.\nKatie Drummond: This is a very deep well of papal knowledge that you are bringing to the table here.\nLauren Goode: Yes. Katie, just watch the movies and tell me you aren't at least curious about going down a rabbit hole.\nKatie Drummond: I have so many questions.\nLauren Goode: Mike, what's your recommendation?\nMichael Calore: Oh, speaking of rabbit holes. So I try to maintain a veneer of professionalism on this show, but I have decided that today is the day where I am going to bring my authentic self to the microphone.\nKatie Drummond: Oh my God.\nMichael Calore: And recommend something that is entirely on-brand for me, if you know me personally, but that I don't really talk about a lot here, which is in the new issue of The New Yorker, the current issue of The New Yorker, I should say, that you can get on newsstands now, and on the New Yorker website, there is a very long profile of the band Phish.\nKatie Drummond: Oh my God.\nLauren Goode: Yes. Yes.\nMichael Calore: P-H-I-S-H.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nKatie Drummond: Yeah, we know the band.\nLauren Goode: Can I just say, last weekend, Mike and I were at brunch, and Mike ran into an old friend, and I immediately said, “Oh, are you a Phishhead?” Because I knew that Mike's community of friends around San Francisco, they've seen some shit together.\nMichael Calore: We have, yes. Many, many colors. I went to school in Vermont in the 1990s, so it's like I'm genetically a Phishhead. But this profile, there have been a lot of profiles about Phish. This one, written by Amanda Petrusich, is by far the definitive profile of the band.\nKatie Drummond: Oh, wow.\nMichael Calore: First of all, it has all of the things that you need to know. There's a bunch of little minutia. They've been together for 40 years, so there's this long story about how they got together and how they feel about music and blah, blah, and every profile has that. But the thing that this profile has that no other profile has, is it has the outsider's perspective of somebody who has been to shows and understands the band, but has not fully gone into the whole lifestyle, doesn't go to every show, is not like a super-duper fan. But understands them enough and loves them enough to write about them in a way that is compassionate and intelligent.\nThe other thing this profile has is, it talks about this thing that happens during their performances where for 10 minutes, the whole place just turns into this giant blob of humanity that's all on the same mental wavelength. Phish fans call it the portal, the band also call it the portal. Like when they go into the portal, this happens, and it lasts 15 or 20 minutes, and then when it closes and they come back to reality, the entire stadium erupts and cheers because everybody was feeling the moment. And that's the ineffable thing about going to one of their shows that I've never read before. And when I read it in this profile, I was like, thank God. Somebody got it.\nKatie Drummond: Well, maybe I'll like them.\nLauren Goode: This is great. Butter, Pope and Phish.\nKatie Drummond: In The New Yorker. Phish in The New Yorker. That's what, it's not Phish. It's Phish in The New Yorker.\nThank you for listening to Uncanny Valley.

    "content_text": "On Wednesday, the team behind the official Donald Trump memecoin sparked a trading frenzy after announcing that the investors who held the largest amount of the crypto coin in the coming weeks would be invited to a gala dinner attended by the US president.\n“At this intimate private dinner, hear first-hand president Trump talk about the future of crypto [sic],” reads the listing on the TRUMP coin website. “The most exclusive invitation in the world. Only for the top 220 $TRUMP meme coin holders.” The dinner is set to take place on May 22.\nTraders rushed to buy up the TRUMP coin, some trying to bump themselves onto the invite list and others simply hoping to profit, according to analysis by blockchain analytics firm Nansen. Within an hour, its price had surged by almost 60 percent.\nHowever, for the two organizations that own 80 percent of the coin’s supply—CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, offshoots of a conglomerate owned by Trump—the market price was a secondary concern. In the immediate term, those firms profit primarily based on how frequently people trade it.\nWhen Trump announced his memecoin in January, the two organizations funneled 10 percent of the total supply into a so-called liquidity pool, the purpose of which is to ensure the asset can be traded freely. In return for supplying liquidity and promising to buy and sell the coin as trades come in—known as market making—the Trump-affilitated organizations command a fee. That fee ranges from 0.1 to 10 percent of each trade depending on the present level of demand. Think of it like surge pricing on a ride-hailing app.\n“If you have a coin and you control the market making and the fees generated, what you care about is volume and price movement, not price itself,” says Nathan van der Heyden, head of business development at crypto company Aragon.\nPreviously, Trump-affilitated entities have reportedly earned tens of millions of dollars in trading fees in connection with the TRUMP coin. In the 24 hours following the dinner announcement, $1.6 million in fees were collected by contributors to the TRUMP liquidity pool on Meteora, the exchange through which the token was originally launched. Most of that money will have accrued to CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight as the largest contributors to the pool, based on previous reports.\nOn paper, the Trump-affilitated organizations also stand to gain by any appreciation in the price of TRUMP, as they are by far the largest holders. But in practice, they are prevented from selling their stash of coins, partly by a mechanism that limits access to their holdings for a three-year period, and partly by the prospect of a backlash resulting from the inevitable drop in price caused by any large sales.\n“The optics of profiting from selling your own coin are terrible, while profiting from the market making is opaque enough to protect your reputation,” says van der Heyden.\nMeanwhile, anyone who bought into TRUMP as the price surged on Wednesday risks ending up out of pocket. Jockeying for a seat at the gala dinner is a powerful incentive to buy. Once that goes away the price of the Trump coin is likely to fall, analysts say, even if the possibility of future dinners and other perks for owners of the coin might temper any dropoff.\n“Very likely there would be a slump afterwards,” says crypto analyst Noelle Acheson, formerly of crypto brokerage Genesis.\nEven as the price of TRUMP rose after the announcement, sophisticated crypto investors with a track record of profitability—so-called smart money traders—sold their stakes in the coin, according to Nansen. “Smart money isn’t interested in the TRUMP token, I can tell you that,” says Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at Nansen.\nWhen Trump first announced his memecoin, days before the inauguration, critics accused the incoming president of embarking on a money-grab at the expense of his regular supporters. Others worried that the coin could act as a vector for bribery; by investing large sums into the coin, driving up its price, politically motivated actors could in theory curry favor with the president surreptitiously.\nThe dinner gambit—an apparent attempt to sell access to the sitting president and manufacture a surge in trading—represents the potential culmination of those fears. The largest holders that have put themselves forward for the dinner are listed in a leaderboard on the TRUMP coin website, but their identities are concealed behind alphanumeric crypto wallet addresses.\nThe White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n“Crypto industry insiders have pretty much fully understood that Trump’s understanding of crypto is extremely superficial,” claims van der Heyden. “He only cares because he sees potential personal gains.”",

    "content_text": "On March 20, Stephen Ehikian, acting administrator of the General Services Administration, was asked a seemingly simple question during an all-hands meeting with staff: Who from the GSA worked for Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency? To Ehikian, the answer was far from straightforward. “D-O-G-E?” he asked, according to a video obtained by WIRED and sources with firsthand knowledge of the meeting. “You’re talking about DOGE?” Then he clarified: “There is no DOGE team inside of GSA.\n“I’ve never seen a leader lose credibility in real time before,” says a current GSA employee. “It was like the ‘plummeting’ sound in a cartoon. We all see the team there. There’s an entire section of the building blocked off where they work.”\nThe GSA, which manages federal office buildings and IT, was an early DOGE target, with Musk-linked individuals swiftly infiltrating the agency after Trump took office. As the team began working out of the GSA headquarters in Washington, DC, the agency ramped up its physical security. A section of the sixth floor, which had previously stood open, was blocked by a guard and a door, which now requires a key card to enter. That is where Ehikian and the DOGE team work, according to current staff members.\nIn fact, at least a half dozen DOGE affiliates, including Musk’s top lieutenant Steve Davis and former Palantir intern Akash Bobba, are currently listed in the GSA employee directory and have GSA email addresses. All are tied directly to the administrator’s office, at the highest level of the GSA org chart. Two additional names with ties to Musk-owned companies recently appeared in the directory as well: Dave Malcher, who previously worked at SpaceX, and Raj Jegannathan, VP of information security and internal apps at Tesla. These names, and their association with the GSA, have not been previously reported.\nThe GSA and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.\nThe ambiguity around who is and is not DOGE starts with the fact that there are in fact two DOGEs: the repurposed US Digital Service, now known as the US DOGE Service, and a temporary organization within the US DOGE Service called, naturally, the US DOGE Service Temporary Organization, which is tasked with carrying out the DOGE agenda. In some cases, DOGE affiliates are hired directly into federal agencies. In other cases, they are detailed to those agencies temporarily.\nSince Donald Trump retook the White House in January, people with ties to Elon Musk or his companies have popped up all over the federal government. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer, now leads the Technology Transformation Services. Michael Grimes, an investment banker at Morgan Stanley who helped finance the Twitter deal, is now a senior adviser at the Commerce Department. Even Ehikian, while not a DOGE employee, is married to a former designer at Musk’s social media company X and has taken up the mantle of cost-cutting, targeting 50 percent reductions in spend across the GSA. All appear to be carrying out Trump's DOGE agenda, although they do not work for DOGE directly.\nThe question of who DOGE is has taken on an almost metaphysical quality as the organization’s mandate has expanded. According to Trump’s January 20 executive order establishing DOGE, every federal agency is required to create a DOGE team of at least four employees. (Ehikan’s claim that there is no DOGE team at the GSA may be technically true, but if so, the agency would seem to be in violation of the order.)\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at zoe.schiffer87 and kateknibbs.09.\nThose teams—some members of which are career civil servants and certainly not DOGE employees of any description—were originally tasked with carrying out DOGE’s stated mission to make the government more efficient. But subsequent orders, including a March 20 order to eliminate waste, fraud, abuse, and data silos, have massively widened the scope of DOGE’s work, leading one set of plaintiffs to allege that “‘waste, fraud, and abuse’ are not magic words, and they cannot conjure up a need to grant DOGE Team members on-demand access to Americans’ most sensitive and personal information,” according to a lawsuit filed by the AFL-CIO and other labor groups.\nAll of this means that the line between who is working for DOGE and who is enthusiastically doing DOGE is blurry at best.\nTake DOGE affiliate and former Tesla employee Riley Sennott, who according to a recent Business Insider report was listed as a “senior adviser” at NASA and also appeared to work for the GSA. Sennott was listed as an “IT specialist” GS-15 employee on the GSA’s payroll at the time, WIRED confirmed. Sennott’s journalist father, Charles Sennott, published a column later that month in the Columbia Journalism Review explicitly stating that his son works at the GSA—not DOGE. “It is fair to say that Riley’s current work is part of a broad effort that the public has come to know as DOGE,” the elder Sennott wrote—but also argued that “the General Services Administration is not the same as Elon Musk’s self-proclaimed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.”\nA number of other high-profile DOGE team members, including Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, Ethan Shaotran, Nicole Hollander, Jeremy Lewin, Luke Farritor, Kyle Schutt, Nathan Cavanaugh, Justin Aimonetti, and Ashley Boizelle, were listed on the GSA payroll at the time Ehikian made his comments at the March 20 all hands, according to documents viewed by WIRED. (Coristine, Shaotran, Hollander, and Farritor are listed as having salaries of $0, while the others collect from $120,000 to more than $150,000 annually.) Sara Sami, the president of an HR consultancy serving federal agencies, says this doesn’t necessarily confirm that they work within the agency, since the GSA processes payroll for other agencies and committees. “They could be classified as DOGE employees, but their pay could be run through the GSA,” she says. GSA employees can also be detailed to other agencies.\nStill, GSA employees say they see DOGE affiliates in the office every week. WIRED has confirmed sightings of Coristine, Shaotran, Farritor, Cavanaugh, Gavin Kliger, and Marko Elez over the past few months.\n“They’re young tech bros walking around together,” says a current GSA employee. “It’s obvious who they are,” agrees another.",

    "content_text": "With vaccination rates among US kindergarteners steadily declining in recent years and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. vowing to reexamine the childhood vaccination schedule, measles and other previously eliminated infectious diseases could become more common. A new analysis published today by epidemiologists at Stanford University attempts to quantify those impacts.\nUsing a computer model, the authors found that with current state-level vaccination rates, measles could reestablish itself and become consistently present in the United States in the next two decades. Their model predicted this outcome in 83 percent of simulations. If current vaccination rates stay the same, the model estimated that the US could see more than 850,000 cases, 170,000 hospitalizations, and 2,500 deaths over the next 25 years. The results appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n“I don’t see this as speculative. It is a modeling exercise, but it’s based on good numbers,” says Jeffrey Griffiths, professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, who was not involved in the study. “The big point is that measles is very likely to become endemic quickly if we continue in this way.”\nThe United States declared measles eliminated in 2000 after decades of successful vaccination campaigns. Elimination means there has been no chain of disease transmission inside a country lasting longer than 12 months. The current measles outbreak in Texas, however, could put that status at risk. With more than 600 cases, 64 hospitalizations, and two deaths, it’s the largest outbreak the state has seen since 1992, when 990 cases were linked to a single outbreak. Nationally, the US has seen 800 cases of measles so far in 2025, the most since 2019. Last year, there were 285 cases.\n“We’re really at a point where we should be trying to increase vaccination as much as possible,” says Mathew Kiang, assistant professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford University and one of the authors of the paper.\nChildhood vaccination in the US has been on a downward trend. Data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from state and local vaccination programs found that from the 2019–2020 school year to the 2022–2023 school year, coverage among kindergartners with state-required vaccinations declined from 95 percent to approximately 93 percent. Those vaccines included MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), polio, and chickenpox.\nIn the current study, Kiang and his colleagues modeled each state separately, taking into account their vaccination rates, which ranged from 88 percent to 96 percent for measles, 78 percent to 91 percent for diphtheria, and 90 percent to 97 percent for the polio vaccine. Other variables included demographics of the population, vaccine efficacy, risk of disease importation, typical duration of the infection, the time between exposure and being able to spread the disease, and the contagiousness of the disease, also known as the basic reproduction number. Measles is highly contagious, with one person on average being able to infect 12 to 18 people. The researchers used 12 as the basic reproduction number in their study.\nUnder a scenario with a 10 percent decline in measles vaccination, the model estimates 11.1 million cases of measles over the next 25 years, while a 5 percent increase in the vaccination rate would result in just 5,800 cases in that same time period.\nIn addition to measles, the authors used their model to assess the risk of rubella, polio, and diphtheria. The researchers chose these four diseases for their infectiousness and risk of severe complications. While sporadic cases of these diseases do occur and are usually related to international travel, they are no longer endemic in the US, meaning they no longer regularly occur.\nThe model predicted that rubella, polio, and diphtheria are unlikely to become endemic under current levels of vaccination. Rubella and polio have a basic reproduction number of four, while diphtheria’s is less than three. In 81 percent of simulations, vaccination rates would need to fall by around 35 percent for rubella to become endemic in the next 25 years. Polio, meanwhile, had a 50 percent chance of becoming endemic if vaccination rates dropped 40 percent. Diphtheria was the least likely disease to become reestablished.\n“Any of these diseases, under the right conditions, could come back,” says coauthor Nathan Lo, a Stanford physician and assistant professor of infectious diseases.\nTo evaluate the validity of the model, the researchers ran a scenario with recent state-level vaccine coverage rates over a five-year period and found that the number of model-predicted cases broadly aligned with the number of observed cases in those years. The authors also found that Texas was at the highest risk for measles.\nOne limitation of the study was that the model assumed that vaccination rates were the same across all communities within a state. It didn’t take into account large variations in vaccination levels. Pockets of low vaccination rates, like in the Mennonite community at the center of the West Texas outbreak, would likely lead to local outbreaks that are larger than expected given the overall vaccination rate.\nThe study also didn’t take into account the possibility that vaccination rates could rebound in an area in response to an outbreak. “That’s the thing that we have control over. If you’re able to change that cycle, then that disease won’t spread anymore,” says Mujeeb Basit, associate chief of the Clinical Informatics Center at UT Southwestern Medical Center, who wasn’t involved in the study.\nKiang and Lo say the full impact of decreased vaccination will likely not be seen for decades. “It’s important to note that it’s totally feasible that vaccinations go down and nothing happens for a little while. That’s actually what the model says,” Kiang says. “But eventually, these things are going to catch up to us.”",

    "content_text": "Motorola unwrapped new Razr folding smartphones today—the Razr, Razr+, and Razr Ultra—the latter a pricier model that expands the family. But at the company's closed-door launch event on Wednesday in New York City, much of the spotlight was on Moto AI, artificial intelligence features powered by in-house and third-party large language models, like Meta's Llama.\nGoogle's Gemini is naturally available on the Razr phones, but for the first time, the AI search engine Perplexity AI will be preinstalled on the devices. The CEO of Perplexity, Aravind Srinivas, took the stage to talk about the optimizations made to take advantage of the Razr's unique design. Motorola even says Microsoft's Copilot will also come preloaded at launch. That's a whole lot of AI for such small phones.\nThe 2025 Razr lineup starts at $700 for the base Razr, $1,000 for the Razr+, and $1,300 for the Razr Ultra; the midrange Razr+ is almost the same device as the Razr+ from 2024, with a few enhancements to durability. It wasn't all phones, either. Motorola showed off new open-ear earbuds called Moto Buds Loop, complete with a Sound by Bose collab and Swarovski crystals embedded into the earbuds. And the Moto Watch Fit is a basic fitness watch for Android phones. Here's everything you need to know.\nThe 2025 Razr Family\nThe core change throughout the Razr 2025 lineup is the build quality. Motorola says a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate makes all the Razr models four times stronger than the previous stainless steel; it can withstand 35 percent more folds than before. The glass is thinner, which Motorola says allows for less of a crease at the fold, and the IP48 dust and water resistance is a small step up from most folding phones that aren't rated for any dust protection.\nThe Razr Ultra specifically employs Corning's Gorilla Glass Ceramic, not unlike Apple's Ceramic Shield on its iPhones, for supposedly 10 times better drop performance. (The Razr+ and Razr use Gorilla Glass Victus.)\nTexture and color are other ways Motorola is trying to differentiate its smartphones. The company says that in 2024, 65 percent of the phones it sold were not dark or neutral tones—colors that have long dominated the smartphone market. That's why the new Razrs have a rich, colorful palette. Textures also play an important role, and the Razr Ultra comes in four finishes: Mountain Trail, which uses FSC-certified wood; Scarab, which is the first-ever use of Italian-made Alcantara on a smartphone; Cabaret, for a satin-inspired finish; and Rio Red, for a leather-inspired look.\nMotorola also claims 25 percent of its Razr customers come from iOS, an unusually high figure in a category where iPhone owners tend to stick with Apple's hardware. More incentive for Apple to prioritize a folding iPhone.\n|Specs\n|Razr 2025\n|Razr+ 2025\n|Razr Ultra 2025\n|External display:\n|3.6-inch pOLED, LTPS, 90 Hz\n|4-inch pOLED, LTPS, 165 Hz\n|4-inch pOLED, LTPO, 165 Hz\n|Internal display:\n|6.9-inch AMOLED, LTPO, 120 Hz\n|6.9-inch, pOLED, LTPO, 165 Hz\n|7-inch, AMOLED, LTPO, 165 Hz\n|Processor and RAM:\n|MediaTek Dimensity 7400X with 8 GB\n|Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 with 12 GB\n|Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite with 16 GB\n|Storage:\n|256 GB\n|256 GB\n|512-GB and 1-TB options\n|Battery:\n|4,500 mAh\n|4,000 mAh\n|4,700 mAh\n|Cameras:\n|50-MP main, 13-MP ultrawide with Macro Vision, 32-MP inner selfie camera\n|50-MP main, 50-MP telephoto (2X), 32-MP inner selfie camera\n|50-MP main, 50-MP ultrawide, 50-MP inner selfie camera\n|Updates:\n|Three Android OS updates, 4 years of security updates\n|Three Android OS updates, 4 years of security updates\n|Three Android OS updates, 4 years of security updates\n|Extras:\n|30W wired charging, 15W Qi wireless charging, IP48, fingerprint sensor\n|45W wired charging, 15W Qi wireless charging, IP48, fingerprint sensor\n|68W wired charging, 30W Qi wireless charging, IP48, fingerprint sensor, Gorilla Glass Ceramic, Dolby Vision video capture\n|Carrier compatiblity:\n|Works on all three major US networks\n|Works on all three major US networks\n|Works on all three major US networks\n|Colors:\n|Spring Bud, Gibraltar Sea, Parfait Pink, Lightest Sky\n|Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, Hot Pink\n|Rio Red, Scarab, Mountain Trail, Cabaret\n|Price:\n|$700\n|$1,000\n|$1,300\nThe Razr+ and Razr Ultra retain that larger 4-inch external screen, over the Razr. Motorola says it's more customizable, with the ability to add dedicated panels for your friends’ contact info, music streaming panels, and even more widgets for quick, glanceable access without constantly opening the phone. When you flip it open, the Razr Ultra now boasts the largest 7-inch screen of the lot, achieved by narrowing the bezels around the display.\nOn the camera front, the main change is with the Razr Ultra. The second camera is now an ultrawide, while the telephoto stays on the Razr+ model. This was a slightly controversial move last year, when the Razr+ cut the ultrawide in favor of a 2X optical zoom. Having an ultrawide on a flip makes it easy to fit more people in the frame in group shots. The Ultra is also the only model of the lot that can capture videos in Dolby Vision, for more accurate colors.\nAll three devices can take advantage of a new photo feature called Signature Style, which lets you adjust the colors and tones of a photo, which can then be applied to all your images for a personalized aesthetic. But the Razr Ultra has some exclusive features. Group Shot is like Google's Best Take on Pixel phones, merging images to avoid a group photo where one person is blinking. Action Shot changes the shutter speed to make sure motion is tack-sharp, and Air Gesture lets you start video recording hands-free with a palm gesture, and stop recording with a fist.\nThe Ultra has the biggest battery, and it charges the fastest—wired and wirelessly—supporting 68-watt wired and 30-watt wireless charging. It's also the only Razr with a dedicated “AI key,” a button on the left edge of the phone that triggers Moto AI.\nMoto AI\nMotorola announced Moto AI last year and opened it up for beta, and the company says it has been refining the features based on user feedback. While you're able to use Google's Gemini assistant on these phones like other Android devices, you can now access Perplexity AI through the preinstalled app or Moto AI if you ask to “talk to Perplexity.”\nMoto AI's core features are Catch Me Up, Remember This, and Pay Attention. Catch Me Up summarizes notifications, prioritizing urgent messages, if you're coming back to your Razr after some time and have a pile of notifications to sift through. Remember This lets you ask Moto AI to remember anything, even ask it to save screenshots, and you can ask it to recall that information later on. Pay Attention starts an audio recording, where the Razr will auto-transcribe a conversation and provide a summary at the end.\nA few new tricks are here that weren't announced before, like Next Move. This predicts what you might want to do based on what's on the screen. Naturally, Motorola also has some AI generation services—Image Studio lets you create AI-generated art, and Playlist Studio comes up with a fresh playlist based on a prompt, though it seems to only work with Amazon Music right now.\nIf you put the Razr Ultra in tent mode, you'll enable a hands-free Moto AI mode, which lets you have a conversation with Motorola's assistant without manually activating it.\nMoto Things\nRounding out the announcements are “Moto Things,” Motorola's umbrella term for accessories. They include open-ear earbuds, the Moto Buds Loop, and a new smartwatch, the Moto Watch Fit.\nOpen-ear earbuds are all the rage, and Motorola is elevating the look and sound with two collaboration partners: Bose and Swarovski. Yes, the earbuds have Sound by Bose for souped-up audio quality, and there's a version of the Buds Loop with Swarovski crystals. They have all the standard features you'd expect in earbuds today, from spatial sound support and a water-repellent design to 37 hours of battery life with the case alone (eight hours for the buds). No word on the price, though they arrive this summer.\nThe Watch Fit is not a Wear OS smartwatch, so you won't be able to use your favorite apps on this fitness watch. It works with any Android phone, and the Apple Watch-inspired 1.9-inch OLED screen will let you check notifications, control music playback, and track workouts. It can track your heart rate, sleep, and blood oxygen, plus it sports built-in GPS. It has an IP68 water-resistance and a 5 ATM rating, and 16 days of battery life. Motorola did not share pricing, but this wearable will arrive sooner in the “coming weeks.”\nThe Razr, Razr+, and Razr Ultra will be available for preorder starting May 7, and they officially go on sale May 15.",

    "content_text": "Google announced at the beginning of April that it is launching a streamlined tool that will allow business users to easily send “end-to-end encrypted” emails—an effort to address the longstanding challenge of adding additional security protections to email messages. The feature is currently in beta for enterprise users to try out within their own organization. It will then expand to allow Google Workspace users to send end-to-end encrypted emails to any Gmail user. By the end of the year, the feature will allow Workspace users to send the more secure emails to any inbox. Email spam and digital fraud researchers warn, though, that while the feature will provide a new option for email privacy and security, it will also inevitably spawn new phishing attacks.\nEnd-to-end encryption is a protection that keeps data scrambled at all times except on the sender and recipient's devices, and it is difficult to add to the historic email protocol. Mechanisms to do it are typically very complicated and costly to implement and only make sense for large organizations trying to meet specific compliance requirements. In contrast, Google's end-to-end encrypted email tool is simple to use and doesn't require significant IT overhead. The scenario that digital fraud researchers are most concerned about, though, relates to the case where a Workspace user sends an end-to-end encrypted email to a non-Gmail user.\n“When the recipient is not a Gmail user, Gmail sends them an invitation to view the E2EE email in a restricted version of Gmail,” Google wrote in a blog post. “The recipient can then use a guest Google Workspace account to securely view and reply to the email.”\nThe fear is that scammers will take advantage of this new and more secure communication mechanism by creating fake copies of these invitations that contain malicious links, and prompt targets to enter their login credentials for their email, single sign-on services, or other accounts.\n“Looking at Google's implementation, we can see it introduces a new workflow for non-Gmail users—receiving a link to view an email,” says Jérôme Segura, senior director of threat intelligence at Malwarebytes. “Users might not yet be familiar with exactly what a legitimate invitation looks like, making them more susceptible to clicking on a fake one.”\nGiven email's technical limitations, Google created a way for an organization's Workspace to automatically manage keys—used to descramble encrypted messages. Key management is what makes end-to-end encrypting email so difficult, so offering a solution that is easy for customers is a departure from what's currently available. The fact that the organization's Workspace controls the keys rather than storing them locally on a sender and recipient's devices does mean that the feature doesn't quite qualify as end-to-end encryption in the strictest sense of the term. But researchers say that for use cases like business compliance, the tool could still be extremely useful. And individuals who want end-to-end encrypted communications should just use a purpose-built app like Signal.\nWhen Gmail users receive one of the new encrypted emails from a Google Workspace user, Google's extensive array of dynamic spam filters and fraud detection mechanisms will be in play to protect against spam, phishing, and rogue imposters broadly. But email users outside the Google ecosystem will also be able to receive encrypted email invitations, which makes the service available to anyone, but also will leave non-Google users to their own devices.\nScammers will prey on anything topical to generate new scams, and this threat certainly isn't unique to Google's new encrypted email feature. The invitations to view end-to-end encrypted emails will come with a warning that says, “Be careful when signing in to view this encrypted message. This message is from an external sender and is encrypted. Make sure you trust the sender and their identity provider before entering your username and password.”\n“While it’s absolutely true that scammers are always looking for new ways to abuse any product, we built this particular technology with this risk in mind,” Google spokesperson Ross Richendrfer said in a statement. “The notifications users will receive in this case are very similar to Drive file sharing notifications that go out whenever someone shares a doc or file. All the protections we employ to keep scammers from capitalizing on these messages will help us protect this new class of notifications as well.”\nGenerations of Google Drive and Google Docs scams show, though, that it is particularly difficult to combat imposter invitations outside of Google's ecosystem. But when it comes to the new end-to-end encrypted email feature, “it was either adding a warning or not allowing this feature for non-Gmail users,” Malwarebytes's Segura says.\nIn fact, the new tool may offer particularly good fodder for scammers, given that Google is such a trusted organization, and targets may have heard about how end-to-end encryption is a special, gold-standard security feature.\n“It's almost as if someone at Google knew this was a bad idea and asked for a warning to be added,” Malwarebytes’ Segura says. “It's quite likely fraudsters will jump on the opportunity to craft phishing emails using this exact same template, even including the original warning that will be overlooked.”",

    "content_text": "Best Gifts for Women Who’ve Checked Out of Planet Earth\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nConsidering the current state of affairs, the best gifts for the women in our lives are the ones that let them mentally clock out for a bit. The world is on fire—literally and figuratively. Human rights are being stripped away; the climate is in free fall. Some days, I'll catch myself staring at the sky and think, I wish I could hitch a ride to space, but of course, that fantasy has been ruined too. If the remarkable woman in your life is exhausted by the headlines, by the slow-motion collapse of democracy, by the sheer audacity of men in power, or perhaps just the overall state of humanity, she deserves a unique gift that offers more than just distraction. She frankly needs a portal to another reality, but since that's not possible just yet (to my knowledge), a temporary escape will have to do.\nSkip the gift cards and scented candles, I've rounded up the best gifts for women surviving the dystopian quest that is 2025. You can't buy her a ticket to an exoplanet (yet), but you can wrap up a TheraFace depuffing wand ($149) or a Deco Gravity Bong ($88) to make life on Earth slightly more bearable.\nBe sure to check out our other gift guides, too, like the Best Housewarming Gifts, Gifts for Moms, and Best Travel Gifts.\nUpdated April 2025: I've added the Biird Namii clitoral stimulator, the Litter Robot 4, and the Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nA Smart Chef\nBreville\nSmart Oven Air Fryer, Noir\nIf I have to feed myself, I want a kitchen appliance that does most of my labor. The Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Noir is that appliance. She’s goth. She’s gorgeous. She air-fries, slow-cooks, and bakes with zero complaints. There are 11 preset functions, to be exact. I don’t know what all of them do, and I don’t care, because she knows. I don’t want to think about settings, and with Breville’s Element iQ system, which auto-adjusts temperature for precision cooking, I don’t have to. There’s even an app, which I didn’t download, because I’m busy. For an extra $100, you can splurge on the Joule Oven Air Fryer Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends), our Best Upgrade Air Fryer pick—but I’d argue it’s not the Noir.\nFor the Cat Lady Who’s Scooped Enough\nWhisker Litter-Robot 4\nIf I could outsource every task on Earth to a robot, I would—and that’s why I’m an owner of the Litter-Robot 4. After your cat goes, it waits a bit, then tumbles the litter to sift out the clumps, which drop into a hidden waste drawer below. It even syncs to an app that tracks how often your cat(s) go, how much they weigh, and whether the waste drawer is full. It is expensive. It does struggle to tell my two cats apart, but it’s trying its best. And, I’ve had some issues with leaking, but customer service has been super responsive. I’ll take that over manually scooping poop ever again.\nThe Gift of Pleasure\nBiird\nNamii Suction Vibrator\nGet her the Namii Clitorial Suction Stimulator & Vibrator. It’s tiny. It’s mighty. It’s hands-free (!!!), made of soft silicone, with five vibration patterns and five suction intensities. It’ll blow her mind and then blow it again. It even sits on a cute glowing charging stand that doubles as a nightlight. Gift the Namii to your bestie, or to your partner if you want to spice things up (any sex toy can be a couple’s toy with a little creativity).\nFor a Cosmic Glow-Up\nDr. Dennis Gross\nSpectraLite FaceWare Pro\nThe future of self-care is here, and it looks like a sci-fi horror movie. The Dr. Dennis Gross SpectraLite FaceWare Pro is on every woman's wish list, using red (630-nm red and 880-nm infrared) and blue light (415 nm) therapy to reduce breakouts, firm skin, and smooth out fine lines—all while making her look like a Transformer. It's FDA-cleared and comfortable to wear during the quick but effective three-minute sessions. It's also wireless, so she can do her skincare routine while doomscrolling, meditating, or plotting revenge. See more mask options in our guide to the Best LED Face Masks.\nThe One-Pitcher Solution\nBrüMate\nTogosa (49 ounces)\nThe BrüMate Togosa gets it. It’s a wine chiller, pitcher, or whatever you need it to be, because we no longer have the patience for single-purpose objects. Slide in a pre-chilled bottle, twist the lid shut, and let the BevGuard triple-insulation keep your drink icy without ice, condensation, or a watery demise. When the vibe shifts from pinot to sangria, swap out the chiller lid and pour in your batch of whatever (up to 49 ounces). The leakproof strainer lid also keeps fruit, ice, and other garnishes from pouring through. And because being checked out of Earth doesn’t mean trashing it, its lids are made from 13 recycled water bottles, some finishes are dishwasher-safe to conserve water usage, and the vessel itself is built to last for a lifetime. (If for some reason it doesn’t, BrüMate also offers a lifetime warranty.)\nHot and Cold Therapy for Her Face\nTherabody\nTheraFace Depuffing Wand\nTherabody's TheraFace Depuffing Wand doesn’t leave my side during travel. It combines hot and cold therapy to tackle puffiness, improve circulation, and better absorb skincare products before application. The curved applicator and precision tip zero in on tricky spots, like under the eyes or across the jawline. The Depuffing Wand has three preset temperature levels for each mode. The cryotherapy is consistent throughout the six-minute session—plus, it won’t drip or crack if you forget about it in the freezer like traditional ice rollers. (Don’t put it in the freezer.) There’s also a little light that flashes at the three-minute mark to remind you to switch sides, though you’ll miss it if you’re too busy staring into your soul in the mirror.\nA Personal Theater\nDangbei\nFreedo\nSometimes, the only way to check out is to beam yourself into another world, preferably one with juicier plotlines. This projector has 450 ISO lumens and 1080p resolution, with 4K support and color calibration. The gimbal stand tilts 165 degrees for projecting on walls, ceilings, or the back of an RV. The included hard-shell case is great for portability and easy storage. It runs for 2.5 hours on a single charge, and it's power bank-compatible, so you can watch from anywhere. Its AI-powered setup takes care of autofocus, screen fit, obstacle avoidance, and keystone correction, so she doesn't have to fiddle with settings with every tectonic shake. For more projectors, check out our guide.\nSmart Mindfulness\nHoMedics\nDrift 11-Inch\nNot everyone has the square footage for a full-on meditation temple, but this 11-inch wonder is compact enough to fit on a console or side table. The teeny metal sphere slides through sand, fabricating spellbinding patterns that lure your mind into a tranquil trance. With over 100 hypnotic designs and ambient light options, it’s a customizable zen garden. You can tweak the speed, soundscapes, or even commence a guided meditation through its companion app. It’s mindfulness made smart, so she can get some peace at least for a few minutes.\nFidgeting Through Havoc\nSpeks\nOdds Silicone Fidget Magnets\nThese Speks Odds Silicone Fidget Magnets are here to help you survive your stay in the stress-stricken simulation. Each set comes with three palm-sized magnets, encased in soft and textured silicone, that are designed to keep your hands busy while your brain zones out. I can’t stop fiddling with them when I’m watching TV and during Zoom calls. I can’t risk losing them by taking them outside, so they’ve found a home on my desk.\nSpeks also sells starter kits and gift bundles packed with other fidget toys. I loved the Moon Jelly Gump Memory Gel Stress Ball, until I handed it to my boyfriend for five minutes and he popped it. Men ruin everything.\nFor the Woman Ready for Blast Off\nNwtn Home\nDeco Gravity Bong\nThe Deco Gravity Bong is here to defy more than just gravity. Handmade from thick borosilicate glass, this tabletop beauty isn’t just functional—it belongs on display. Aesthetically, it delivers an old-world opulence that makes you feel like you’re lounging in a 1920s speakeasy. It’s also discreet enough to blend into your glassware or home decor collection. It’s composed of four easy-to-clean components—shell, core, 14mm bowl, and a silicone gasket—that are also replaceable if something shatters, so she doesn’t have to shell out for a whole new set. The orchid colorway is sold out, but you can still find it in petal, baltic amber, charcoal, emerald, or clear.\nThe Bag That Knows No Borders\nAway\nThe Everywhere Tote\nThe Everywhere Tote is for the woman who is going where the universe takes her. It has everything one might need for far-flung travels: a 16-inch padded laptop sleeve, a handful of interior pockets, and a water-resistant nylon exterior for when you’re caught in an otherworldly atmospheric anomaly. Available in elemental shades like coast blue, sea green, and clay pink—it’s at home anywhere, from the gym to an impromptu odyssey. If she needs to jet off on a moment’s notice, it’s got a key clip, a trolley sleeve, and an exterior pocket for her wallet and passport. It also meets airlines’ personal item requirements.\nA Hair Dryer That Will Survive the Apocalypse\nL’Oreal Professionnel\nAirLight Pro\nIf we must eke out an existence on this planet, we might as well have perfect hair while we do it. The AirLight Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) uses near-infrared light, high wind speed, and controlled heat to dry hair faster, more quietly, and with less damage than most traditional hair dryers. It leaves strands 33 percent more hydrated and 59 percent smoother, all while using 31 percent less energy—which is more than we can say for most people in power.\nIt’s not cheap, but it’s only slightly pricier than a Dyson SuperSonic and unlike the Dyson, it’s repairable if something breaks. Bonus: It works abroad, so whether she’s escaping to a tropical vacation or an underground bunker, at least her hair will be fabulous.\nMapping the Cosmos\nCelestron\nStarSense Dobsonian Telescope\nIf she needs a break from reality (or perhaps is scouting for new planets), the Celestron StarSense Dobsonian Telescope (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the perfect gift. It offers some of the best optics you can get for under $1,000, and its Celestron StarSense app makes celestial navigation easy, even for first-time stargazers. WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson says this Newtonian telescope, with its two-axis altazimuth mount, is not too heavy or difficult to operate. This means she can use it in her backyard or haul it to a remote desert where she can pretend humanity doesn’t exist for a while.\nSlip Into a Simulation\nMeta\nQuest 3\nReality is overrated. Why not log off this timeline and into another? The Meta Quest 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite VR headset, offering pure escapism in an untethered PC-free package. It's lighter and comfier than its predecessor, with better visuals, improved object detection, and hand tracking. According to WIRED contributor Matt Kamen, the metaverse is pretty much a ghost town … which is great for us; the fewer dudes, the better. Come to think of it, how cool would it be if we did take over the metaverse? We could call it the FemmeVerse. (All right, I'll keep brainstorming.)\nA Personal Alarm to Feel Safer in This Hellscape\nShe’s Birdie\nOriginal Birdie\nWalking home alone at night on this planet is an absolute nightmare. If she can’t teleport away from creeps, she can at least blast a 130-decibel siren and flashing strobe light in their direction. The Birdie is a small but mighty alarm that will (hopefully) deter attackers and alert anyone nearby for help.\nI’ve used the original model for over a year (see my thoughts in my guide to the Best Personal Safety Alarms), and it’s given me peace of mind whenever I’m walking solo. The Birdie+, which I have yet to test, adds some useful features like location sharing, emergency support, and even a fake call function for a quick exit strategy. Plus, it comes in the cutest patterns. My one caveat is that this wouldn't be my first choice as a birthday gift, as it's kind of a downer.\nThe Government Wishes It Knew You This Well\nOura\nRing 4\nIf she’s training for a marathon, tracking her stress cycles, or just wants hard data to justify why she feels like garbage, the Oura Ring 4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the most stylish health tracker out there. Packed with advanced sensors, it monitors heart rate, skin temperature, sleep quality, and stress levels. WIRED editor Adrienne So has worn one for years, and it remains one of the only wearables that can reliably predict her menstrual cycle. Plus, it works with both Android and iOS, so she’s not locked into a single tech ecosystem.\nFor the Pain in Her Back\nHyperice\nVenom 2 Back\nShe’s been carrying the weight of the world for far too long. The Hyperice Venom 2 Back melts away tension with targeted heat and vibration therapy. With three heat levels (up to 131 degrees Fahrenheit) and three vibration settings, it stimulates circulation, loosens tight muscles in the lower back, and offers relief when you’re sitting at your desk for eight hours trying not to scream. It also doubles as a soothing heat pad for period cramps. Best of all, it automatically shuts off, so she can zone out without worrying about turning it off. Check out some other options in our guide to the Best Massagers.\nBecause Our Water Supply Is Another Thing You Can't Trust\nLarq\nBottle PureVis\nYes, you read that right. The LARQ Bottle PureVis (as seen in our guide to the Best Reusable Water Bottles) is a self-cleaning, reusable water bottle that uses UV-C light to sterilize itself every two hours. No more moldy smells, biofilm buildup, or questionable aftertastes. It’s double-insulated BPA-free stainless steel and the charge lasts three weeks—so she doesn’t have to worry about germs while she’s fighting the patriarchy. The PureVis 2 also includes a filter, but it tends to slip off inside the bottle, so I can go without it.\nSleep Through Another News Cycle\nTherabody\nSleepMask\nThe Therabody SleepMask is a game-changer during flights. Where else would I have to block out every living being than the airport? I can confirm it is 99.9 percent (is anything ever 100?) effective at blocking light. The standout feature, though, is that it uses three vibration patterns designed to lull you into a deeper sleep. The contoured padding feels like pillows on my eyelids, and the adjustable strap keeps it in place without tugging at my hair. I tend to wake up multiple times at night, but with the SleepMask, I can just turn on another session of the vibration, and it usually puts me back to sleep.\nBuild-a-Galaxy\nLego\nThe Milky Way Galaxy\nShe may not be able to move to another planet, but she can build a 3D model of the Milky Way from the comfort of her home. This 3,000-ish piece LEGO set recreates the spiral galaxy, turning our jumbled universe into galactic home decor. The finished piece can be mounted on the wall as a daily reminder that Earth is just one of billions of planets we believe exist—surely, at least one of them has better men.\nWired Coupons\n10% off Dell Coupon Code for New Customers\nSamsung Promo Code: 10% off TVs\nBusiness PCs - Extra 5% Off HP Coupon Code\n10% off Canon promo code with upgrade\nExclusive NordVPN Coupon: 76% off\nLG Promo Code: 20% Off Your First Order",

    "content_text": "It’s been 10 years since the Apple Watch debuted. It was actually announced at a special event on September 9, 2014, but only became available to buy seven months later, on April 24, 2025.\nWhile it seems hard now to recall a time when the Apple Watch, or something similar, did not exist, the market hasn't always been so obvious. It was only 10 years ago that we were still wondering if Pebble would actually pan out, and all anyone wanted a Fitbit for was to get in their 10,000 steps (an entirely arbitrary number, but I digress).\nWhen it debuted, the first Apple Watch was glitchy and expensive. Battery life sucked. Many publications, including mine, spent significant time and space wondering why anyone even wanted a smartwatch. Today, it is an Apple success story. “Since 2015 til the end of 2024, we estimate that 281.2 million Apple watches have been shipped,” Jitesh Ubrani, a device research manager at IDC, tells WIRED. That's at an estimated value of $127 billion. No wonder it has spawned a flotilla of imitators.\nHowever, on its 10th anniversary (or perhaps more appropriately its aluminum anniversary), the Apple Watch Series 10 faces a tumultuous global market. Even before the Trump administration announced tariffs, global smartwatch sales were slumping. As innovation slows (or is blocked in patent disputes), people are now holding on to their Apple devices for longer, while newer smartwatches, such as the Galaxy Watch are also coming for Apple’s lunch.\nSleeping Beauty\nCheck Reddit’s r/AppleWatch and you’ll find people who still own—and use—the original Series 0. It’s a reminder that Apple’s Jony Ive poured years of work into a tiny design that was originally intended to be a piece of jewelry, before reportedly clashing with executives over what the watch’s eventual function would be.\nInitial unfortunate nomenclature aside—Tim Cook casually called it “the iWatch”, before that horrible name was kiboshed due to patent squabbles—it was beguiling, and Ive had his wish. Walking into an Apple Store and picking out your case and accessories was the closest many might have come to a luxury watch purchasing experience.\nBecause the Watch is not just a simple timepiece—you can change it to suit your needs or mood. When you buy an Apple Watch, you can also pick or change your bands, from the now-classic Milanese loop to the company’s successful collaboration with Hermès. You can change your watch face to suit your outfit, to check if Snoopy has a cute new cartoon for the day, to go sailing, or map your way back off the trail. Those two ingenious buttons on the case’s back that let you easily switch out your straps at a whim with no tools are now copied by almost all manufacturers in the watch industry, not just smartwatch manufacturers.\n“Apple showed that [the strap] was a critical part of the design language, but also laid down the gauntlet in engineering secure, easy-to-use quick-release systems that didn’t require tools. Brands have put a lot of R&D into this,” said Tim Barber, WIRED’s watch expert.\nWhile the $10,000 Apple Watch was certainly a folly—you still have to update an Apple Watch, even when it’s pure gold (except when you no longer can)—the watch itself is to my eyes both beautiful and declaratory: Wearing one signifies that you’re a serious person who cares about fitness and getting work done. It’s the only watch that has ever outsold the entire Swiss watch industry, and actually, Barber notes, in part, reinvigorated the luxury watch industry.\n“Rather than wipe out mechanical watches, as some thought it would—hence the folly of TAG Heuer, Montblanc, and others getting into ultimately inferior smart watches—Apple Watch reinvigorated them as a prestige item specifically apart, and in opposition to, digital culture,” says Barber. “That undoubtedly benefited watchmakers. It’s almost certainly been a net positive.”\nIve and the Apple Watch design team hit upon a key concept when it comes to digital wearables: It’s a form of self-expression that you wear on your wrist, and it must actually look good for you to want to wear it. It was a health tracker that wasn’t as overtly health-coded as a Fitbit or a Garmin. In fact, when the Series 0 first launched, it had only a few simple health features—the now iconic Activity Rings, the workout app, an optical heart sensor, and the heart app.\nTen years on, Activity Rings remains one of the best examples yet of fitness gamification. (Today is also Global Close Your Rings Day; if you close them today, you get a limited-edition award.) Every fitness tracker has a step counter, but the visual demonstration of how little you have left to do to close the Move ring has launched a thousand memes, and even a couple T-shirts.\nA Wellness Story\nPrior to the Apple Watch, smartwatches were conceived as a kind of wrist-based mini smartphone, to ping you with notifications or to take calls off your wrist. David Naranjo, associate director of Counterpoint Research, noted in a phone call with WIRED that Apple’s success in this category was largely due to completely changing the watch’s use case—from being a smartwatch to being a smartwatch with a dedicated health and fitness aspect.\n“Fitbit and others had [an ecosystem and apps], but there were other things they were not able to do,” Naranjo said. “Apple built out the ecosystem and made the health care story very strong. Not only did the company focus on fitness and heart rate, it went beyond fitness and looked at a much deeper level of health care. That’s where Apple excelled.”\nEvery year, Apple launches one stand-out health feature, from measuring VO2 Max on the Series 3 to the ECG sensor on the Series 4, all the way to sleep apnea notifications on the Series 10. “If you zoom out way into the future, and you look back and ask what Apple’s biggest contribution was, it will be in the health area,” Cook said in an interview with WIRED last year.\nThis is a bold thing to say, especially given that the Series 10 and Watch Ultra 2 don’t even have blood oxygen measuring, due to a patent dispute with the medtech company Masimo. For a while, Apple has been doing research into features that would transform the Apple Watch for people with chronic conditions, like adding noninvasive blood glucose monitoring for diabetics, or adding blood pressure measuring for people with hypertension. Alas, despite promising advances, these features have yet to materialize.\nApple’s latest project, an AI-assisted comprehensive health service, is far behind other health manufacturers such as Oura, Whoop, or even Garmin. Imagine, for example, being able to take a picture of your meal with the Watch Ultra and uploading it to the (still rudimentary) Health app, the way you already can with the Meals feature on an Oura Ring 4. You have to imagine it for now, of course, because the Apple Watch doesn't currently have a camera, and Apple’s Visual Intelligence is still limited to the iPhone 16. But it seems within reach.\nStill, the Watch’s wearability and seeming ubiquity does mean that it has a track record of saving peoples’ lives, whether that’s by notifying users of an irregular heart rhythm via the ECG feature or calling the emergency services if it recognizes the user has fallen or been in a serious crash. I also have a personal anecdote to report—before the blood oxygen feature was removed, I had pneumonia. How did I know? My blood oxygen level, as measured by the watch, was at 84 percent. I went to urgent care and got antibiotics, stat.\nWhile Apple has not historically always been first to market with a new health feature, it’s a fast follower, and the features nearly always work. “Apple owners are very patient when it comes to Apple,” Naranjo says. “They’ve come to believe that Apple doesn’t rush to market with something that isn’t almost perfect.”\nWhy You Wear It\nThat point seems to bear out with the research. In 2022, nearly 80 percent of Apple iPhone owners also owned an Apple Watch, and it accounted for 56 percent of smartwatch sales in the North American market. Most importantly, research suggests most people who own an Apple Watch are pretty satisfied with their device.\nAs most of them are likely Apple users already, it helps that the Watch—like all Apple devices—integrates seamlessly with Apple’s ecosystem. It’s intuitive, easy to use, and has an interface that is pleasing to experience—both for the first time and 10 years on. I still twirl and push the tiny digital crown every day, and I find it a great way for navigating the device's smaller menus without obscuring text with your fingers.\nThe Taptic Engine that gently buzzes on your wrist has now been adapted to dozens of uses, from waking you up in the morning to gently pointing you in the right direction while you’re walking or biking around and using Apple Maps. There is no way to count just how many tourists have not gotten robbed because they did not need to pull out their phone to figure out how to get back to the hotel from the bagel shop, but the number I imagine must be considerable. Whether you’re pausing a podcast or doing a couple toe touches in the middle of the day, life seems a little easier with an Apple Watch.\nI took a brief and stunningly informal essay of WIRED Gear team members who also wear Apple Watches on why they bought or wear one. Notifications, integration with the Apple ecosystem, and fitness tracking were the most common answers. “Waterllama also helps me keep track of my hydration,” product reviewer Ryan Waniata says.\n“Can I confess that … the only thing I use my Apple Watch for is to ding my iPhone and find out where I lost it at home?” asked senior writer Zeyi Yang. Yes! I use it to find my AirPods Pro, too. The UWB chip that debuted in the Series 9 has saved countless minutes every morning, even if you’re just finding AirTags and your phone with it, but sadly not using it to unlock your self-driving Apple car.\nIt’s so easy to use, we’re still willing to forgive its most annoying flaws, most notably the battery life. Charging my Apple Watch every day is the bane of my existence, and despite years of efforts to improve it, the closest that Apple has come is to launch … fast charging? Loading media onto the watch, even basic offline maps, is such a hassle that even Apple has resigned itself to the fact that most people will end up carrying their phone instead. Apple Watch will even still buzz you to stand up when you're driving on a freeway.\nBut most of all, there is the unfashionably late arrival of Apple Intelligence, which launched on iPhone last October. So far, the only Apple Intelligence features that you can use on the Watch (if you have not disabled it due to privacy concerns, or the fact that it’s just kind of annoying or inaccurate) are notification summaries and the Reduce Notifications focus. This is underwhelming, to say the least. The only consolation is that Apple Watch users are not the only Apple customers waiting for Apple Intelligence to become useful.\nIn 2022, I wrote that Apple’s wearables seem designed for an increasingly terrifying world. While I made fun of the marketing at the time, the world has gotten more uncertain and scary. I’m glad that I talked my husband into wearing an Apple Watch Ultra, and, thanks to Crash Detection, I will now know if he gets into a car accident on the way home. My aging parent now wears an Apple Watch with Fall Detection (and moved two blocks away from me, but that’s another thing), which gives me peace of mind. Since I’ve gotten older, I’m glad that there are more cardio health features on the watch, particularly now that I know that nearly half of all adults in the United States have high blood pressure.\nSo despite the slowing market, I am still waiting to see what new features—health or otherwise—will be announced at this year’s WWDC, and later on this year. “I would never count Apple out in terms of what they’re able to do,” said Naranjo. “They’ve proven time and time again that they can create a new category and make that category grow.”\nI can be patient and wait in Apple’s sticky ecosystem, biding time until blood glucose monitoring shows up. Ten years ago, we all asked if we could even find a use for Jony Ive’s piece of glittery, buzzing jewelry; not even Apple knew the future success that it had on its hands (or its wrists). The Apple Watch is ubiquitous, and we’re still waiting for more.",

    "content_text": "The Best Diffusers for Curly Hair\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nWe know a thing or two about the best diffuser for curly hair. No shade to any other section, but I think it's safe to say that we have a lot of great hair on the WIRED Reviews Team. Our Zoom meetings are full of poppin' curls and mind-boggling volume. But all that gorgeous hair takes work, and luckily, we're no strangers to putting in the extra effort toward styling our hair. Diffuser routines have a learning curve and require a bit of elbow grease, but they can help curls and waves look their very best. Our top picks, like the T3 StyleMax Dryer, work for both hair patterns.\nA typical hair dryer shoots a jet of hot air straight out, which is great for adding volume or styling straight blowouts. But a jet of concentrated air can cause waves and curls to poof out and lose their shape. Diffusers—you guessed it—diffuse the air and distribute it evenly, helping to disperse that concentration while still offering volume and faster drying. People frequently use the typical nubby-ended, bell-shaped design to help lift and scrunch their textured hair while simultaneously drying it. This results in a voluminous, styled curl or wave with less frizz. And the diffusion makes the air a bit more gentle on your hair, leaving behind less damage. Some diffusers have longer prongs, a different shape, or more air distribution holes, and some styling products can tweak the final look, but the result is still the same basic concept: enhanced natural texture and volume from root to tip. So long as you're prepared to sweat for it.\nBe sure to check out our other hair-related buying guides, including the Best Hair Dryers, Best Blow-Dry Brushes, Best Hair Masks, Best Hair Straighteners, and Best Curling Irons.\nUpdated April 2025: We’ve added two new diffusers from WavyTalk and T3, updated our assessment of the Bellissima Diffon, and ensured accuracy throughout.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nMore About Our Hair\nWIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe has thick, long, curly, mixed-race hair ranging from curl type 2A to 3A. It's low-porosity and usually dry or damaged thanks to her penchant for bleaching it and dying it neon pink.\nNena Farrell has wavy, fine hair in her natural color with a curl type that ranges from 2B to 3A. Her hair is high porosity and leans toward being frizzy on its own. During this testing window, her hair was only about chin-length.\nWe've also included some notes from former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano, who has thick, coarse, long, curly hair that varied in pattern from layer to layer. And some recommendations from editor Kat Merck, who is a fan of straightening her hair and no stranger to heat styling.\nHow We Tested\nTo find the best diffuser for curly hair, we tested each dryer and diffuser in this guide on a minimum of three wash days. We tried every setting and attachment, and we compared notes on the diffusers’ different characteristics, weights, and features. We aimed to include a mix of diffusers that will work for multiple hair types and hair routines. See photos below of our hair dried with each diffuser or attachment.\nHelpful Information About Diffusing\nA proper diffusing routine starts in the shower: Wash, condition, and detangle your hair before diffusing for the best results. Apply styling products while your hair is still damp or wet. Avoid touching your hair or drying it roughly during the diffusing process to minimize frizz.\nTemperature matters: The higher the temperature, the faster your hair will dry, and the drier and more frizzy it will be. Conversely, low temperatures can help cut back on frizz, damage, and flyaways, but this can add a lot of time to your drying routine.\nGet to know your hair type: Do you have waves, curls, or coils? Is your hair high-porosity or low-porosity? Do you use water-soluble products or are they silicone-based? Do you sleep with your hair protected? All of these will have an impact on the best styling methods. You can find great resources on the curly hair subreddit, the Pattern, and our sister site Allure. YouTube and TikTok also are full of great information, and of course you can ask your hairstylist to teach you more about your hair type. Have fun in the rabbit hole!\nHonorable Mentions\nBeachwaver Co. Blow-Drying Hair Brush for $189: This cute blow-dry brush has a set of attachments that includes a diffuser. It’s a solid choice if you want both a blow-dry brush and a diffuser, but there are cheaper options if you don’t want the blow-dry brush included.\nOur Favorite Products\nEvery person is different, and it can take some trial and error to nail down the right diffuser routine. Maybe you want to dry your hair fully, or maybe you want to take it to 80 percent. Maybe you want a leave-in, a curl gel, and a hair oil, or maybe you just need a little heat protectant. These are some products we like to use during our own hairstyling routines that might come in handy for yours.\nTurbie Twist Microfiber Towel for $20: I like to plop my hair after the shower for a few minutes to absorb some water before diffusing. These microfiber towels are designed to stay put, and they soak up a lot of moisture without drying my hair too much. Others swear by plopping with a T-shirt, but this is what works best for me.—Louryn Strampe\nPattern Leave-In Conditioner for $28 and Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Cream and Gel for $19: I put a glob of leave-in conditioner in my hair after plopping, followed by a palmful of curl cream, and finally a generous amount of gel. This is what primes my natural curl clumps to look their best post-diffusion. It may be too heavy for some curl textures, but this is my favorite method. —Louryn Strampe\nKristin Ess Style Assist Blow-Dry Mist for $12: This is one of the most effective heat protectants I’ve tried that actually cuts drying time—halfway through blow-drying, I can actually tell where I sprayed it and where I didn’t. I wish it were as easy to apply as the Milk_Shake foam primer, below, but the bottle still has a decently targeted spray and the product is lightweight enough not to leave residue. —Kat Merck\nMilk_Shake Lifestyling Blow-Dry Primer for $26: This lightly scented heat protectant is meant to prevent color fading and reduce drying time. It doesn’t do the latter quite as effectively as the Kristin Ess, above, and a little goes a long way, but it will shave off a couple minutes and gets high marks for coming out of the bottle as an easy-to-apply foam, so it’s a snap to ensure you’re getting even coverage. —Kat Merck\nDavines This Is a Curl Gel Oil for $32: This gentle curl gel oil has been fantastic for my fine hair, helping my curls form and keeping them moisturized without weighing them down or making my hair crunchy. It starts out feeling like a gel in your hand, then transforms into an oil on your hair. It's best to use with a diffuser, though I've occasionally used it on air-dry days with similarly good results. —Nena Farrell",

    "content_text": "In January, Meta announced its stand-alone video editing app for making Reels, simply called Edits. After release delays, users anywhere in the world can now download the app and try it out.\nThe new video-creation tool is clearly inspired by the success of ByteDance’s similar CapCut app for TikTok, with tools dedicated to streamlined editing of vertical clips. Instagram’s Reels feed of algorithmically selected clips was launched five years ago, also in direct response to TikTok’s expanding influence at the time. Meta has never shied away from its mimetic tendencies; the company tends to adopt the buzzy software features of other apps by building those same features into its platforms. So, Edits, a creator-focused tool that makes it even easier to pump out social videos, is an unsurprising release designed to keep pace with competition.\nAre you interested in getting started with Edits from Meta? I’ve been exploring the app since it dropped earlier this week. Here’s what you need to know about Instagram’s video-editing tool, how it generates Reels, as well as how Edits differs from CapCut.\nHow to Use Edits, Instagram’s Video Creation App\nThe Edits app is now available to download on both Apple and Android phones. After you first open Edits on your phone, you will be required to log into the app using an Instagram account, which is frustrating but not shocking. Again, Meta’s purpose for the app is not to spur video creation in the abstract; rather, it’s a tool specifically made to help people make content to post on Reels.\nAfter logging in, you’ll see five tabs along the bottom of the app. On the left is the Ideas tab. Here is where you can jot down notes and brainstorm ideas for future Reels, and also watch over your saved videos from Instagram. Next is the Inspiration tab that shows a scrollable feed of videos that use trending audio tracks, plus a button that makes it easy for you to snatch one of those songs and use it in your own video. The middle tab is where all of your in-progress video Projects are located, and this is also the tab where you can upload any clips already stored on your camera roll that you want to turn into Reels. The Recording tab is next along the bottom, where you can shoot videos directly inside of the Edits app. Lastly, on the far right is the Insights tab, which shows engagement data, so you can learn who’s watched your past Reels.\nYou don’t need to have experience with TikTok’s CapCut to get the hang of Edits, although those familiar with existing tools for editing vertical videos will immediately recognize most of this user interface: a timeline of clips in the middle with various tools along the bottom. You can adjust the video’s sound by adding a music clip through “Audio” or tapping on “Voice” to record a voice-over. Here you can also add text, stickers, and image overlays to your video creation. If you’re looking at the timeline of uploaded videos for a project, short-tap on an individual clip in the timeline and move the edges inward to crop its length. Want to try a different clip order? Long-press on a clip and drag it to shuffle everything up.\nDone and ready to post? Tap Export in the top right corner to download the video to your phone. The app will present buttons to share it directly to Instagram or Facebook, but really, since you just downloaded the video, you can post it anywhere you’d like.\nHow Is Edits Different From CapCut?\nWhile the purposes of these two apps are almost identical, there are a few key differences between Meta’s Edits apps for Instagram and ByteDance’s CapCut app for TikTok. Mainly, Edits is more streamlined and doesn’t feel as cluttered—at least for now. There’s no subscription option in Edits to unlock extra features, which is the case with CapCut, though Meta could add subscription tiers to Edits in the future. There’s also not an overwhelming amount of AI-powered editing tools in Edits, which CapCut definitely has, although those could potentially be added at a later date.\nEdits is initially more approachable as an app, but picky creators may find CapCut’s additional options for video editing gives them a more fine-tuned level of control over the final product. Also, if you want to edit videos on a computer, rather than sitting on your smartphone all evening, you’ll want to stick with CapCut—Edits is only available on mobile devices.",

    "content_text": "The United States has spent more than $500,000 on at least 30 YouTube ads this month that threaten undocumented migrants with deportation and a ban on reentry. The campaign, led by Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem, includes messages that criminalize migrants and promote “self-deportation” through the CBP One app.\nAccording to data from the Google Ads Transparency Center, to which WIRED had access, the US government has allocated $594,600 to a digital advertising campaign to deter irregular migration. The funds are distributed across 30 active ads, with a marked geographic focus. California accounted for the largest share of the spending, with $208,000, representing 35 percent of the total. Texas and Florida followed, both with investments close to $120,000, although Florida also recorded additional funds totaling $61,600. Other states with high migrant populations, such as Illinois and New York, were also high priorities, with disbursements close to $48,000 each. In contrast, some border regions received considerably less; Arizona saw just $20,300.\nThis spending pattern is evidence of a strategy focused on established migrant communities, rather than border areas. This distribution reflects an attempt to maximize the psychological and social impact of the message in areas where the migrant population is more vulnerable to misinformation.\nThe US government announced this campaign on February 17. It will be a “multimillion-dollar ad campaign warning illegal aliens to leave our country now or face deportation with the inability to return to the United States.” The goal is to deter irregular migration by combining advanced targeting technology and confrontational language. According to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) documents, the ads will air on broadcast television, social media, and text messages, with multiple language versions tailored to specific audiences.\nJust two months later, those same ads began airing on free-to-air television in Mexico, during soccer games and prime-time shows. In one of the messages, Noem warns, “If you are considering coming to the United States illegally, don't even think about it. Let me be clear: If you come to our country and violate our laws, we will hunt you down. Criminals are not welcome.”\nThis initiative is part of a broader context of state and federal campaigns aimed at discouraging immigration, ranging from public communication strategies, such as billboards and informational messages, to more aggressive measures such as the installation of barbed wire and deportation operations.\nMexico’s President Responds\nIn response, Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, is pushing for legal reform to ban foreign propaganda in local media, calling the spots a violation of sovereignty. The US government and Mexican TV stations—led by Televisa—exploited a legal loophole to broadcast the controversial ads, which are now labeled as “discriminatory” by Mexican authorities.\nFor Sheinbaum—who has often been conciliatory with Trump's demands to avoid economic reprisals—this campaign, which was shown during soccer games and programs with large audiences, crossed the line. On Monday she demanded that the TV stations withdraw the ads. When the ads continued to be broadcast on Mexican TV stations on Tuesday, Sheinbaum announced a reform to the Federal Telecommunications Law to prohibit foreign governments from buying advertising space for political or ideological purposes. The measure, which includes social networks, seeks to reverse a loophole created in 2014, when similar restrictions were eliminated under former president Enrique Peña Nieto.\nThe spots, starring Kristi Noem, link irregular migration with violent crimes: \"Pedophiles. Rapists. Murderers. These are just a few of the illegal aliens we've deported,\" she states in one of the videos. The investment in digital platforms aims to maximize reach.\n\"What can they promote? Tourism, culture. But not discriminatory propaganda,\" said Sheinbaum, who described Noem's messages as an attempt at \"interference\" and a risk to the dignity of migrants.\nThe president is confident that her initiative will be unanimously approved in Congress, even drawing support from the opposition, framing it as a defense of national sovereignty.\nCBP One App Lacks Safeguards\nThe DHS strategy depends not only on aggressive messaging but also on technological tools such as the CBP One app, which used to help migrants prepare for entry into the United States and now allows them to schedule appointments for voluntary deportation or to apply for asylum. However, human rights organizations claim that the app, promoted in advertisements, lacks transparent guarantees and exposes users to expedited deportations.\nOn the other hand, Sheinbaum's reform poses a dilemma for platforms such as Meta and Google: How will they regulate ads paid for by foreign governments in Mexico? The ban would affect not only TV spots, but segmented campaigns on Facebook or YouTube, where the DHS has invested heavily.\nThis campaign is part of Donald Trump's promise to deport \"millions of illegals\" by 2025, using laws such as the Enemy Alien Act and programs such as the termination of humanitarian parole for Cubans and Venezuelans. Although Mexico has cooperated in stemming migration flows, Noem's escalating rhetoric strains a relationship already weakened by trade disputes and threats of tariffs.\nWhile the DHS spends millions deterring migrants, Sheinbaum's legal maneuver could limit future foreign campaigns. But the true impact of both sides will be measured at digital and physical borders.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nYou might have already made up your mind about lining up outside a GameStop to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 when it launches on June 5. Or maybe, if you're like me, you're wondering whether it's smart to shell out $450 for Nintendo's console when prices are jumping everywhere.\nWhatever you decide, the first thing to know is that, as of April 24, Nintendo has launched preorders in the US and Canada. Preorders went live in other countries earlier, but Nintendo canceled the original April 9 preorder window for the two countries to assess the impacts of the tariffs. The good news is that the price of the Switch 2 console remains at $450, and the Mario Kart World bundle is still $500. That said, a few accessories have been hit with a small price hike.\nIn today's age of scalpers, preordering a Nintendo Switch 2 isn't as simple as adding it to your cart when the website goes live. If you buy directly from Nintendo, for example, you need to meet certain requirements. Don't worry, we break it all down in this guide.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nWhat’s New in the Switch 2?\nThe Switch 2 will feel extremely similar to anyone who has used a Switch. It's now larger, with a 7.9-inch screen versus the original's 6.2 inches, but it maintains the hybrid functionality—it's a portable console, but you can dock it to play on a TV. Everything you play on it will look better, thanks to a custom Nvidia graphics card. Nvidia claims the Switch 2 has 10 times better graphics than the original Switch, with ray tracing support and AI-powered upscaling.\nThe LCD screen might feel like a step back from the Switch OLED version—OLED typically offers better contrast and vibrant colors, but LCD is often brighter. That said, the 7.9-inch screen now sports a 1080p resolution with HDR support. It also has a 120-Hz variable refresh rate, meaning you'll see more frames in a single second, making everything on the screen feel more fluid.\nThe Joy-Con 2 controllers are larger to accommodate the bigger console, and now, you can use them as mice in certain games like Drag X Drive. That might also mean that shooting in a first-person shooter can feel more precise, and it can enhance the gameplay of a real-time strategy game like Civilization VII, if your arms don't get tired first. Nintendo confirmed the Joy-Con 2 controllers do not use Hall effect sensors, but are still more durable and smooth. Hopefully, that means no more Joy-Con drift. They now connect to the Switch 2 via magnets.\nThe speakers are better (they now support 3D audio via headphones), and the built-in microphone filters out unnecessary background sounds so your teammates won't hear the blender running in the kitchen. The Switch 2 comes with two USB-C ports, allowing you to charge it in handheld mode when it's on a table, and also connect peripherals like the new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, which lets you bring your face into games when socializing with friends.\nThe new social features are driven by the C button on the right Joy-Con 2, which triggers GameChat. It lets you speak to in-game friends using the mic, and you can even share your screen so your teammates can help you navigate puzzles in case you're stuck, even if they're playing a different game. These GameChat features require a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.\nWhen you place the Switch 2 on the dock, it now outputs 4K resolution with HDR to TVs (up from 1080p). When docked, you will be capped at 60 frames per second at 4K and 120 fps at 1440p resolution. The dock has a USB-C port for power, an Ethernet port for faster internet speeds, and an HDMI port to hook it up to the TV. On the front are two USB-A ports to connect accessories.\nYou can use physical game cartridges, and the Switch 2 cartridges are red. As for storage, you now get 256 GB included (up from 32 GB), and a microSD Express slot to expand space. You cannot use your old microSD card—microSD Express is significantly faster, which affects download speeds and how quickly games load.\nThe Switch 2 costs $450, which is $150 more than the original and $100 more than the Switch OLED. The only game bundle at launch is with Mario Kart World.\nWhen Do Switch 2 Preorders Start, and Where?\nPreorders are live for the Switch 2 as of midnight Eastern time on April 24 or 9 pm Pacific on April 23. The console officially goes on sale June 5. Here are the nitty gritty details from the top retailers, including when stores will open on launch day:\n- GameStop: Preorders start when doors open at retail stores on April 24. That also includes the Mario Kart World bundle. Online preorders begin at 11 am Eastern/8 am Pacific. All GameStop stores will be open on June 5 at 12 am Eastern/June 4 at 9 pm Pacific for the console launch if you want to queue up.\n- Target: Preorders started at 12 am Eastern on April 24/9 pm Pacific on April 23. It's unclear if you'll be able to place a preorder in-store. (Update: Target's website is extremely slow and showing many errors. If you get to the checkout page, keep pushing through and press Place Order until it works—at least, according to a few Redditors. This did not work for me.)\n- Best Buy: Preorders began at midnight Eastern on April 24. (Update: For nearly 30 minutes after midnight, Best Buy's Switch 2 page said, “Coming Soon.” It's now finally available. You'll be placed in a queue, though your luck depends on inventory.) The retailer says most of its stores will be open at midnight on June 5 if you want to pick up your preorder. Make sure you select that at the time of purchase.\n- Walmart: Like Target and Best Buy, you can preorder now at Walmart. (Update: The retailer puts you in a queue, and this was by far the simplest and most seamless checkout process of the big retailers.) Walmart is the only retailer promising that your order will be delivered before 9 am Eastern on June 5 (as long as you preorder by June 4 at 8 am Eastern, while supplies last). This offer only applies to the Switch 2 console and the Mario Kart World bundle.\nIt doesn't look like you'll be able to preorder the Switch 2 through Amazon, but this could change. You can keep an eye on Nintendo's Amazon storefront.\nNintendo Switch 2 Preorder Requirements\nThere's some risk involved in preordering a Switch 2 from one of the big retailers. Scalpers and bots could get to them first, a plague we've seen before with graphics cards.\nThankfully, Nintendo has a solution to prevent all the Switch 2 stock from going to scalpers if you buy directly from the company. First, sign in to your Nintendo Account here and register your interest in purchasing the console (you need to be at least 18 years old). You'll then receive an email when it's your time to purchase, and the company says the first batch of invites will go out on May 8. The invites are first-come, first-served, and you'll have 72 hours to complete the purchase from the time the email is sent out.\nYou have to be the person who purchased the Nintendo Switch Online membership to register, must have paid for it for a minimum of 12 months, and must have opted in to share gameplay data and have at least 50 hours of total gameplay.\nYou can pay with Visa, Mastercard, Google Pay, or Apple Pay, and you'll be paying the whole amount at checkout. Orders will be shipped to your address of choice in the US and Canada. Nintendo says “release-day delivery is not guaranteed due to processing and shipment times,” so you might not have a Switch 2 on June 5.\nWhat Games Are Launching With the Switch 2?\nWhile Nintendo announced a bevy of games during the Switch 2 Direct on April 2, only a select number will be available on June 5.\n- Mario Kart World ($80)\n- Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour ($10)\n- The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 Edition ($80)\n- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Switch 2 Edition ($70)\n- Sid Meier's Civilization VII Switch 2 Edition\n- Street Fighter 6 ($60)\n- Fortnite (Free)\n- Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition ($70)\n- Deltarune ($25)\n- Yakuza 0 Director's Cut\n- Arcade Archives 2: Ridge Racer\n- Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S\n- Split Fiction ($50)\n- Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening\n- Hogwart's Legacy\n- Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster ($40)\nThere will be several other games launching over the summer, like Donkey Kong Bananza, Drag X Drive, and Super Mario Party Jamboree. In the fall and winter, you'll see titles like Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Elden Ring, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.\nWhat Is a Switch 2 Edition Game?\nThe Switch 2 has broad backward compatibility, meaning most Switch games will work just fine. However, Nintendo has announced a handful of “Switch 2 Edition” games that will take advantage of the Switch 2's hardware for enhanced graphics, smoother gameplay, and in some situations, new content.\nIf you do not own Breath of the Wild, the Switch 2 Edition will cost $80. However, if you bought it for the original Switch—physical or digital—you can buy an upgrade pack on the Nintendo eShop for $10. Some upgrade packs will cost $20 if there's new content in addition to the graphics enhancement, like the Star-Crossed World expansion for Kirby and the Forgotten Land.\nAt launch, anyone with a Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership can get the upgrade pack for Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom for free.\nWhat Accessories Are Available for the Switch 2?\nThere are several first-party accessories you can snag for the Switch 2 console. Some of these have seen price hikes due to the tariff trade war.\n- Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: $85 (Previously: $80)\n- Joy-Con 2 Pair: $95 (Previously: $90)\n- Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $40 (Previously: $35)\n- Joy-Con 2 Strap: $14 (Previously: $13)\n- Joy-Con 2 Wheel Set: $25 (Previously: $20)\n- Nintendo Switch 2 Camera: $55 (Previously: $50)\n- Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set: $120 (Previously: $110)\n- Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector: $40 (Previously: $35)\n- Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case: $85 (Previously: $80)\n- Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter: $35 (Previously: $30)\n- Samsung microSD Express Card (256 GB) for Nintendo Switch 2: $60\n- Lexar microSD Express Card (256 GB) for Nintendo Switch 2: $56\nCan I Trade in a Nintendo Switch for a Discount?\nYou might be better off holding onto your original Nintendo Switch, but if you want to reduce the sting of buying a Switch 2 even a little bit, GameStop will have special trade-in values that start on April 24. You can get up to $125 for a standard Switch, $175 for a Switch OLED, or $100 for a Switch Lite. The catch is they need to be in pretty good condition—GameStop will not accept Switch consoles with Joy-Con drift. You also need everything that came in the original box.\nI Just Want to Play GameCube Games. Do I Need a Switch 2?\nOne of the big announcements from the April 2 Nintendo Direct was that GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. Just like how you've been able to enjoy SNES and Game Boy games, now you can relive the glory days of the GameCube. Titles include The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and Soul Calibur 2. These games will look better and play at higher resolution, though they’re not remasters.\nThese GameCube games will launch on June 5 alongside the Switch 2, and you'll need to subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online: Expansion Pack. (That's a separate, pricier tier from the standard Switch Online membership.) You can also snag a cordless, modernized version of the GameCube controller to play these games, though the original will still work with the right adapter. Unfortunately, you will need a Switch 2 console to play these GameCube games. They're not compatible with the original Switch.",

It's now larger, with a 7.9-inch screen versus the original's 6.2 inches, but it maintains the hybrid functionality—it's a portable console, but you can dock it to play on a TV. Everything you play on it will look better, thanks to a custom Nvidia graphics card. Nvidia claims the Switch 2 has 10 times better graphics than the original Switch, with ray tracing support and AI-powered upscaling.</p><p class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe iDXPAN callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">The LCD screen might feel like a step back from the Switch OLED version—OLED typically offers better contrast and vibrant colors, but LCD is often brighter. That said, the 7.9-inch screen now sports a 1080p resolution with HDR support. It also has a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/high-refresh-rate-explained/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">120-Hz variable refresh rate</a>, meaning you'll see more frames in a single second, making everything on the screen feel more fluid.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The Joy-Con 2 controllers are larger to accommodate the bigger console, and now, you can <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/mouse-mode-on-nintendo-switch-2-already-needs-an-overhaul/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">use them as mice in certain games like <em>Drag X Drive</em></a>.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago, WIRED has continued to update our mask recommendations due to the constant changes in availability and evolving guidance. Add to that the threat of toxic air, not only from wildfire smoke but, even worse, from burning homes. Now is the time to purchase masks in the same way one would buy a first aid kit or medicine, just in case. Some masks—like our top affordable pick, the Honeywell Safety DF300 N95 Flatfold ($23 for 50)—are ideal for public transportation or for use in a theater, and others—like our top overall N95 pick, IQAir's KN95/FFP ($70 for 12)—are put on during or after a wildfire. With the risk of disruption hitting mask supply chains, along with the issues of counterfeit masks, community spread of illness, a longer and more active wildfire season, climate change, and the sometimes-vanishing guidance pages on government websites, it’s important to keep your masks at the ready.\nMost alarming is the Trump administration’s recent gutting of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website declares, “Due to the reduction in force across NIOSH, no new respirator approval applications can be accepted.” This will impact compliance and safety of new and future manufactured masks. Masks do have expiration dates, but I still think now is a good time to stock up on a variety of masks that you know are certified safe and effective.\nWe've also included some tips on mask care and choosing the best kind of mask straps at the end of this list. Be sure to check out our other air quality guides, including the Best Air Purifiers, Best Indoor Quality Monitors, and Best Fans.\nUpdated April 2025: We've added IQAir N95/FFP2 Mask, ChicoBag Reusable 3-Layered Cloth Mask, 3M Particulate Respirator N95 (8511), and Rugged Comfort Quick Latch Half Facepiece with Multi Gas/Vapor Cartridges.

Subscribe Today.\nWait, Which Kind of Mask Should I Get?\nBack in 2022, the CDC's guidance on masks was updated to say that N95 masks offer the “highest level of protection.” However, the agency still says that the best mask is one you'll wear correctly.\nThe best kinds of disposable face masks to wear haven't changed a lot:\n- N95 masks are your best bet. The federal National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regulates N95s to meet a certain standard of quality. N95s are sometimes referred to as “respirators.”\n- KN95 and KF94 masks are also effective, and likely comfier. KN95s are governed by a different set of standards specific to China and are sometimes easier to find. KF94 masks are similar to KN95s but governed by a Korean standard. These are also sometimes referred to as “respirators.”\n- Surgical-style masks (three-ply) are the next best thing you can wear. They aren't as effective as the above masks, but if they have a good, tight fit they can still be effective in less risky settings. We have tips on how to improve your fit in our guide to our favorite masks.\n- Cloth masks are not as effective. If you can't get your hands on the masks listed above, at least wear a cloth mask. They're better than nothing but likely far less effective, depending on their material makeup.\nIt's incredibly important to get a mask that fits your face. A big part of the reason cloth or even surgical masks can be less effective is due to the gaps between the mask and the face. These areas can allow unfiltered air to get through and enter your nose and mouth. N95 masks are generally designed to fit snugly, which is why they're safer. However, the CDC advises those with heart or lung problems to talk to their doctor before using an N95, since wearing these masks can make it harder to breathe.\nWhat Are Workplace Performance Masks?\nMost of the CDC and Food and Drug Administration's mask guidance and standards were initially designed with medical settings like doctors' offices and hospitals in mind. However, Covid-19 made it much more common and necessary for people to wear masks in nonmedical contexts. To help with this, the ASTM International standard makes it easier to classify masks for everyday work.\nUnder this standard, masks can be labeled as either Workplace Performance or Workplace Performance Plus. The NIOSH recommends using these masks in a workplace environment but, crucially, does not recommend them as a replacement for N95 or other respirators. If you or someone you interact with regularly is a high-risk individual, or if you work in a medical setting, you should stick with N95s.\nThis standard rates masks based on filtration, breathability, and an optional leakage ratio. The CDC has a list of masks here, and it tells which masks pass enough of these criteria to qualify for either of the Workplace Performance labels (as of writing, there are only three that earned the label), but this is all based on data reported by suppliers and manufacturers. If you can't find N95 masks but don't work in a high-risk setting, these are also decent masks to pick up.\nAlso, note that ASTM refers to the agency that classifies standards, but this workplace standard is not the only ASTM standard that governs masks. This standard is technically ASTM F3502-21, which only has the two Workplace Performance levels mentioned above. You may also see other masks that use labels like “ASTM Level 3,” which refer to different ASTM standards for medical masks. For our purposes, all of this means that if you're looking for low-risk masks for the office, look for the Workplace Performance labels.\nHow Do I Avoid Counterfeit Masks?\nThere are several ways to spot counterfeit N95 masks, such as by looking for markings on the mask itself or by avoiding N95 masks marketed to children (since the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health doesn’t approve any type of respirators for kids). These markings include the manufacturer's name, TC (testing and certification)-approval number, model number, lot number, and filter designation. The CDC offers much more thorough guidance on how to avoid N95 counterfeits on its site.\nWe don't recommend buying just any mask you see on Amazon, since Amazon allows third-party sellers on its platform that may not vet products as well as those sold by Amazon.com. You should know that Walmart, Target, and other retailers may also sell third-party masks—make sure you always look at the seller. The masks on this list are legitimate, as are many masks you'll find in major retail chains, like CVS, or from US manufacturers.\nEarly in the Covid-19 pandemic, the CDC authorized the emergency use of KN95, KF94, and other non-N95 masks in health care settings, and that order was revoked in June 2021. Still, many KN95 or KF94 masks are more than adequate for everyday use for low-risk individuals, and they're far better than no mask at all. When shopping for a mask, keep in mind what your needs are and how you plan to use the masks you buy.\nKN95s must be stamped with GB2626-2019 if the masks are made after July 1, 2021 (which means they're in accordance with new quality control standards by the Chinese government). If the mask is stamped with a GB number ending in 2006, it was made based on the previous standard and is still fine to use so long as the expiration date hasn't passed. KF94 masks, on the other hand, won't have the stamp but should include “Made in Korea” on the packaging, along with the product name, manufacturer and distributor name, expiration date, and lot number.\nCan I Reuse Disposable Masks?\nIf you stop into a doctor's office for two minutes to make an appointment, do you need to throw it out? Not exactly.\nFor specific instructions and information on your N95 mask, you should check the manufacturer's instructions. But if you can't find data from your mask manufacturer on how many times you can take a mask on and off, the CDC's guidelines state that N95 masks will become less effective the more times they're taken on and off. Part of the reason for this is that the elastic bands wear out and result in a less tight fit. You should throw away your N95 mask when the straps are stretched out and no longer fit snugly on your face, or when the mask becomes dirty, wet, or damaged. You also shouldn't put your N95 in the oven or microwave to sterilize it.\nRemoving a mask also requires touching it, which can mean particles transfer from the mask to your hands and then back to your face. It's a very good idea to wash your hands effectively after removing or replacing a mask. Try to avoid touching the mask itself and use elastic bands.\nDo Disposable Masks Expire?\nYes. According to WellBefore, “many N95 masks have a shelf life of 2-5 years, but you should check the expiration dates on them to be sure.” That’s because, with time, the materials and elastic bands used in the mask can deteriorate. The expiration date is typically printed on the mask or the filter. However, according to the CDC, the Occupational Safety and Health institute doesn't require the shelf life to be printed on the product packaging. You should contact your manufacturer for more information if it's not printed on the mask or you can't find it. All KN95 and KF94 masks, on the other hand, should have the expiration date printed on the packaging (otherwise, they're counterfeit).\nWhat to Know About Masks in 2025\nDifferent masks protect you from different kinds of bad air. There is a difference between a surgical mask and an N95 respirator. And then there are the very different reusable respirators that one might associate with home contractors, but are recommended protection in areas of wildfire. And how you wear a mask is just as important as wearing the right mask for the right situation. We now know that the burning of a residential building, as in the case of the recent Los Angeles wildfires, produces dangerous levels of volatile organic compounds known as VOCs. And to keep yourself safe, you’ll need more than an N95 in that environment. You’ll need a respirator. And choosing the right respirator is one more step everyone should know, including the color-coded system to help consumers understand their level of protection. Some respirators keep you safe from unhealthy levels of PM 2.5, and others have the added protection of filtering out toxic vapors.\nWhile cloth masks have been found to be less effective than surgical masks, they continue to be the mask I can tolerate best for all-day wear. And as studies suggest, the cloth mask efficacy depends on the number of layers and materials used. Another issue with masks is proper wear. I can’t be the only person to witness people wearing masks covering only their mouth but not their nose. A mask that is not sealed and fit to the face properly will lose its full range of protection. One of the CDC’s more creative web pages is their infographic of approved facial hair for masks. The soul patch, villain, and walrus facial hair all work with masks while mutton chops and chin curtain don’t.\nN95 Respirator Face Masks\nThe CDC has a giant list of approved N95 masks. Unfortunately, the supply of many brands is constantly fluctuating (even in 2025), so you may need to check back regularly to see which are in stock. Many stores also have regional stock based on in-store supply, so be sure to check your local zip code where applicable.\nBest Overall N95\nIQAir makes excellent air purifiers, so it’s no surprise it also makes some of the best-fitting and most comfortable N95 masks we tested. There are two ways to customize the fit. There are ear straps along with a hook with two size options to join the straps together. For a complete seal, the straps on the mask face can be pulled to adjust the fit. The mask also uses IQAir Mask Soft Seal technology to conform to the face. The soft gray material does seal to the skin without being sticky.\nWhile it took some time fine-tuning the straps, I was able to wear the IQAir mask with glasses without having them fog up. The masks come in 10-, 12-, and 100-packs and arrive with a zippered carrying case for a single mask. IQAir also makes child-sized versions. And like IQAir’s air purifiers, its masks are not cheap. A 10-pack will run you about $60. Still, I’ve been able to wear each mask more than once and the seal is solid. If there is a new variant of Covid-19, this will be the mask I’ll be wearing.\n|Shelf Life\n|5 years\n|Sizes\n|Adult and Child\n|Adjustable Straps\n|Yes\nGreat Protection at an Affordable Price\nAt around $20 for a box of 10, 3M’s Particulate Respirator N95 is a NIOSH-approved mask to wear when the Air Quality Index (AQI) is very unhealthy or hazardous. This is the mask to keep in your car, next to your emergency bottles of water and granola bars. And while fire season seems to last all year, having a solid respirator can mitigate some of the health hazards of breathing in bad air. 3M’s mask is not as comfortable as IQAir’s soft-fitting mask, but it does have an adjustable nose clip along with two rubber-band-like nonadjustable straps that go around your entire head, and it boasts 3M’s proprietary Cool Flow Valve that claims to keep the face cool in hot weather. That said, the mask’s barnacle-like fit on one’s face does exactly what is supposed to do: It keeps the seal.\nWhile it didn’t fog up my glasses, it isn’t made for comfort. Still, everyone needs a good respirator N95 in their mask collection, and 3M has made one that is both effective and budget-friendly.\n|Shelf Life\n|2.5 years\n|Sizes\n|Adult\n|Adjustable Straps\n|Yes\nAn Upgrade Pick\nThis fold-style mask uses two over-the-head straps to keep the mask snug on your face, while still allowing a fair amount of breathing room in front of your mouth and nose. These are among the pricier masks on our list, but members of our team have used these and found them comfortable and sturdy. —Eric Ravenscraft\nA Design That Fits Well on Most Faces\n3M's N95 respirators are individually wrapped and have two horizontal folds that create a decent-sized cup in front of your nose and mouth. The masks come with two straps that go over your head and neck to keep a tight seal. This is one of the smaller packs on our list, but you may have an easier time finding it in stock at some stores. —Eric Ravenscraft\n|Shelf Life\n|Not specified\n|Sizes\n|Adult\n|Adjustable Straps\n|No\nAn Affordable Option\nThe DF300 N95 from Honeywell is a more affordable option on this list. With this mask, you'll get multilayer absorption (including a humidity- and moisture-resistant filter), a soft inner lining, and latex-free head straps. The nose clip is also adjustable and hidden underneath the mask. It comes complete with a soft foam nose cushion as well, which should make it more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. —Eric Ravenscraft\n|Shelf Life\n|Not specified\n|Sizes\n|Adult\n|Adjustable Straps\n|No\nKF94 Masks\nA Stylish Option\nVida's KF94 mask is both protective and stylish. It's FDA-listed, CE-certified (and manufactured in South Korea), and offers a 94 percent filtration efficiency. The four-layer mask comes in adorable colors including Blush, Seafoam, and Glacier Blue. It's also available in a variety of pack sizes, from 10 to 10,000. —Brenda Stolyar\n|Shelf Life\n|Not specified\n|Sizes\n|Adult and Kids\n|Adjustable Straps\n|No\nA Mask for Large Heads\nThe BOTN KF94 masks only come in large and extra-large for adults, so those with smaller faces should look into the youth size, which also comes in a variety of color options including beige, dark gray, pink, and yellow. The mask has ear loops and a nosepiece that are both adjustable, so it should help ensure a tight fit if you go for the bigger size. I prefer these when wearing makeup, because the nosepiece stays put and doesn’t ruin my foundation as much as other masks do. —Brenda Stolyar\n|Shelf Life\n|Not specified\n|Sizes\n|Adult and youth\n|Adjustable Straps\n|Yes\nA Popular Option\nThis one dips in and out of stock. LG's Airwasher mask is a standard KF94 with a three-dimensional design, four-ply fabric, an adjustable nose clip, and rounded ear loops. If you want a slightly more elevated option, it also comes in a Black Style design that'll likely pair well with fancier outfits for more formal occasions. —Eric Ravenscraft\n|Shelf Life\n|Not specified\n|Sizes\n|Adult\n|Adjustable Straps\n|Yes\nKN95 Face Masks\nA Trendy Option\nEvolvetogether's masks are trendy among celebrities because they're both protective and stylish. The Rio De Janeiro is made of six-ply fabric (complete with activated charcoal to reduce odors), double filtration, and a water-resistant exterior. Each mask also has an adjustable nose bridge and gentle ear loops, making it ideal to wear for long periods of time. Of all the KN95s we've tested, this is our favorite one for smaller faces. While pricey, these masks are not only lightweight and comfortable but super durable as well. —Brenda Stolyar\n|Shelf Life\n|Not specified\n|Sizes\n|Adult\n|Adjustable Straps\n|No\nA Colorful Mask\nThis mask from Halidodo comes in several color sets—one of the options includes eye-catching orange—and is similarly affordable. —Eric Ravenscraft\n|Shelf Life\n|Not specified\n|Sizes\n|Adult\n|Adjustable Straps\n|No\nA Mask With Different Style Options\nThe white Powecom masks come with a multi-filtration system and an adjustable metal nosepiece. You can also choose between the standard KN95 ear loops or the N95 headband style, depending on what you find more comfortable. —Eric Ravenscraft\n|Shelf Life\n|Not specified\n|Sizes\n|Adult\n|Adjustable Straps\n|No\nBest Cloth Mask\nThe ChicoBag Reusable Three-Layered Cloth Mask has been third-party tested and boasts a PFE rating of 0.3 microns. A good surgical mask has superior filtration compared to a cloth mask. As per the FDA, disposable, loose-fitting surgical masks worn by medical professionals are made to protect against splashes and large droplets, but they do not offer adequate protection against aerosol particulates. Still, the ChicoBag Mask has a built-in metal nose bridge and adjustable ear straps with a plastic hook to create a tighter seal than the surgical masks I’ve used in the past. I wore my mask with my glasses and did not experience fogged lenses. There are three layers of fabric to ChicoBag’s mask. The outer layer is a knitted sports polyester reminiscent of my kids’ soccer shorts, there is an inner washable filter, and the layer that touches my face is an upcycled cotton.\nChicoBag claims that a single one of its masks replaces 547 single-use masks. I washed my mask to see if it would retain the same fit, and it actually hugged my chin a wee bit better after I washed and dried it. And while I doubt I’ll get 547 wears out of my ChicoBag Mask, it comes with its own pouch and is my current go-to mask for the subway.\n|Shelf Life\n|547 wears\n|Sizes\n|One size with adjustable straps\n|Adjustable Straps\n|Yes\nHighest Protection for Wildfire and Burned Areas\nI am not sure I would have thought to include a P100 Multi Gas Respirator with Multi Gas/Vapor Cartridges in my mask gear before this year, but now this is a must-have for my entire family. This past year brought New York City’s second-worst drought since record-keeping began, and that led to unprecedented wildfires within the city itself. Both Upper Manhattan and Brooklyn’s Prospect Park burned. My neighborhood smelled like a campfire for several days. That was nothing compared to what Los Angeles went through in early 2025, but it was enough to make me realize that air purifiers alone were not going to keep me healthy.\n3M’s Rugged Comfort is more wearable than 3M’s cheaper Half Facepiece. If you’re heading back to a residential area after a fire, this is the face mask to wear. Its high electrostatic woven filter prevents harmful PM 2.5, and its activated carbon protects from toxic vapors like the ones created when residential buildings burn.\nI tested the medium, and it fit well. It took me a couple of adjustments to get the fit right, and I placed my hands over the filters to ensure it was sealed. I also appreciated the quick-release chin latch to unseal the mask.\n|Shelf Life\n|220 hours of wear\n|Sizes\n|Small, Medium, Large\n|Adjustable Straps\n|Yes",

They're better than nothing but likely far less effective, depending on their material makeup.</li></ol><p class=\"paywall\">It's incredibly important to get a mask that fits your face. A big part of the reason cloth or even surgical masks can be less effective is due to the gaps between the mask and the face. These areas can allow unfiltered air to get through and enter your nose and mouth. N95 masks are generally designed to fit snugly, which is why they're safer. However, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/use-n95-respirator.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CDC advises</a> those with heart or lung problems to talk to their doctor before using an N95, since wearing these masks can make it harder to breathe.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf\"><div class=\"AccordionContainer-foSklP iRHdCZ\"><div class=\"AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY\" data-testid=\"accordion-item-container\"><div class=\"AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM diANax\"><p class=\"paywall\">What Are Workplace Performance Masks?</p></div><button class=\"BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ gTIqfM hKIiJv button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"Button\"}' data-testid=\"Button\" role=\"button\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label\">AccordionItemContainerButton</span></button></div><div class=\"AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb leTzLN opening-animation\"><div><p class=\"paywall\">Most of the CDC and Food and Drug Administration's mask guidance and standards were initially designed with medical settings like doctors' offices and hospitals in mind. However, Covid-19 made it much more common and necessary for people to wear masks in nonmedical contexts. To help with this, the <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.astm.org/f3502-21.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.astm.org/f3502-21.html\" href=\"https://www.astm.org/f3502-21.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASTM International standard</a> makes it easier to classify masks for everyday work.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Under this standard, masks can be labeled as either Workplace Performance or Workplace Performance Plus. The NIOSH recommends using these masks in a workplace environment but, crucially, does <em>not</em> recommend them as a replacement for N95 or other respirators. If you or someone you interact with regularly is a high-risk individual, or if you work in a medical setting, you should stick with N95s.</p><p class=\"paywall\">This standard rates masks based on filtration, breathability, and an optional leakage ratio. The CDC has <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/PPEInfo/RG/FaceCoverings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a list of masks here</a>, and it tells which masks pass enough of these criteria to qualify for either of the Workplace Performance labels (as of writing, there are only three that earned the label), but this is all based on data reported by suppliers and manufacturers. If you can't find N95 masks but don't work in a high-risk setting, these are also decent masks to pick up.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Also, note that ASTM refers to the agency that classifies standards, but this workplace standard is not the only ASTM standard that governs masks. This standard is technically ASTM F3502-21, which only has the two Workplace Performance levels mentioned above. You may also see other masks that use labels like “ASTM Level 3,” which refer to different <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.astm.org/f2100-21.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.astm.org/f2100-21.html\" href=\"https://www.astm.org/f2100-21.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ASTM standards for medical masks</a>. For our purposes, all of this means that if you're looking for low-risk masks for the office, look for the Workplace Performance labels.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf\"><div class=\"AccordionContainer-foSklP iRHdCZ\"><div class=\"AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY\" data-testid=\"accordion-item-container\"><div class=\"AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM diANax\"><p class=\"paywall\">How Do I Avoid Counterfeit Masks?</p></div><button class=\"BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ gTIqfM hKIiJv button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"Button\"}' data-testid=\"Button\" role=\"button\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label\">AccordionItemContainerButton</span></button></div><div class=\"AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb leTzLN opening-animation\"><div><p class=\"paywall\">There are several ways to spot counterfeit N95 masks, such as by looking for markings on the mask itself or by avoiding N95 masks marketed to children (since the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health doesn’t approve any type of respirators for kids). <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/N95-Infographic-Mask-Labeling-508.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">These markings</a> include the manufacturer's name, TC (testing and certification)-approval number, model number, lot number, and filter designation. The CDC offers much more thorough guidance on <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/usernotices/counterfeitResp.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">how to avoid N95 counterfeits on its site</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">We don't recommend buying just any mask you see on Amazon, since Amazon allows third-party sellers on its platform that may not vet products as well as those sold by Amazon.com. You should know that Walmart, Target, and other retailers may also sell third-party masks—make sure you always look at the seller. The masks on this list are legitimate, as are many masks you'll find in major retail chains, like CVS, or from US manufacturers.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, the CDC authorized the emergency use of KN95, KF94, and other non-N95 masks in health care settings, and that order was <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/revoked-euas-non-niosh-approved-disposable-filtering-facepiece-respirators\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">revoked in June 2021</a>. Still, many KN95 or KF94 masks are more than adequate for everyday use for low-risk individuals, and they're far better than no mask at all.

But if you can't find data from your mask manufacturer on how many times you can take a mask on and off, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/use-n95-respirator.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CDC's guidelines state</a> that N95 masks will become less effective the more times they're taken on and off. Part of the reason for this is that the elastic bands wear out and result in a less tight fit. You should throw away your N95 mask when the straps are stretched out and no longer fit snugly on your face, or when the mask becomes dirty, wet, or damaged. You also shouldn't put your N95 in the oven or microwave to sterilize it.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Removing a mask also requires touching it, which can mean particles transfer from the mask to your hands and then back to your face. It's a very good idea to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/rigorous-hand-washing-will-be-part-of-covid-19s-new-normal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wash your hands effectively</a> after removing or replacing a mask.

There is a difference between a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/UnderstandDifferenceInfographic-508.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">surgical mask and an N95 respirator</a>. And then there are the very different reusable respirators that one might associate with home contractors, but are recommended protection in areas of wildfire. And how you wear a mask is just as important as wearing the right mask for the right situation. We now know that the burning of a residential building, as in the case of the recent Los Angeles wildfires, <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP14770\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">produces dangerous levels of volatile organic compounds</a> known as VOCs. And to keep yourself safe, you’ll need more than an N95 in that environment. You’ll need a respirator. And <a href=\"https://healthybuildings.hsph.harvard.edu/wildfirerespiratorselection/#:~:text=We%20recommend%20using%20a%20P100,we%20recommend%20an%20N95%20respirator.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">choosing the right respirator</a> is one more step everyone should know, including the color-coded system to help consumers understand their level of protection. Some respirators keep you safe from unhealthy levels of PM 2.5, and others have the added protection of filtering out toxic vapors.</p><p class=\"paywall\">While cloth masks have been <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://journals.lww.com/jehp/fulltext/2020/09000/Examination_of_parental_knowledge_of_child_weight.191.aspx\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://journals.lww.com/jehp/fulltext/2020/09000/Examination_of_parental_knowledge_of_child_weight.191.aspx\" href=\"https://journals.lww.com/jehp/fulltext/2020/09000/Examination_of_parental_knowledge_of_child_weight.191.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">found to be less effective than surgical masks</a>, they continue to be the mask I can tolerate best for all-day wear. And as studies suggest, the cloth mask efficacy depends on the number of layers and materials used. Another issue with masks is proper wear. I can’t be the only person to witness people wearing masks covering only their mouth but not their nose. A mask that is not sealed and fit to the face properly will lose its full range of protection. One of the CDC’s more <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/facialhairwmask11282017-508.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">creative</a> web pages is their infographic of approved facial hair for masks.

href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/iq-air-atem-x-air-purifier/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">air purifiers,</a> so it’s no surprise it also makes some of the best-fitting and most comfortable N95 masks we tested. There are two ways to customize the fit. There are ear straps along with a hook with two size options to join the straps together. For a complete seal, the straps on the mask face can be pulled to adjust the fit. The mask also uses IQAir Mask Soft Seal technology to conform to the face. The soft gray material does seal to the skin without being sticky.</p><p class=\"paywall\">While it took some time fine-tuning the straps, I was able to wear the IQAir mask with glasses without having them fog up. The masks come in 10-, 12-, and 100-packs and arrive with a zippered carrying case for a single mask. IQAir also makes child-sized versions. And like IQAir’s air purifiers, its masks are not cheap. A 10-pack will run you about $60. Still, I’ve been able to wear each mask more than once and the seal is solid. If there is a new variant of Covid-19, this will be the mask I’ll be wearing.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Great Protection at an Affordable Price</h2><div class=\"CalloutFeatureLargeWrapper-cAQNly

    "content_text": "Here’s a nice little distraction from your workday: Head to Google, type in any made-up phrase, add the word “meaning,” and search. Behold! Google’s AI Overviews will not only confirm that your gibberish is a real saying, it will also tell you what it means and how it was derived.\nThis is genuinely fun, and you can find lots of examples on social media. In the world of AI Overviews, “a loose dog won't surf” is “a playful way of saying that something is not likely to happen or that something is not going to work out.” The invented phrase “wired is as wired does” is an idiom that means “someone's behavior or characteristics are a direct result of their inherent nature or ‘wiring,’ much like a computer's function is determined by its physical connections.”\nIt all sounds perfectly plausible, delivered with unwavering confidence. Google even provides reference links in some cases, giving the response an added sheen of authority. It’s also wrong, at least in the sense that the overview creates the impression that these are common phrases and not a bunch of random words thrown together. And while it’s silly that AI Overviews thinks “never throw a poodle at a pig” is a proverb with a biblical derivation, it’s also a tidy encapsulation of where generative AI still falls short.\nAs a disclaimer at the bottom of every AI Overview notes, Google uses “experimental” generative AI to power its results. Generative AI is a powerful tool with all kinds of legitimate practical applications. But two of its defining characteristics come into play when it explains these invented phrases. First is that it’s ultimately a probability machine; while it may seem like a large-language-model-based system has thoughts or even feelings, at a base level it’s simply placing one most-likely word after another, laying the track as the train chugs forward. That makes it very good at coming up with an explanation of what these phrases would mean if they meant anything, which again, they don’t.\n“The prediction of the next word is based on its vast training data,” says Ziang Xiao, a computer scientist at Johns Hopkins University. “However, in many cases, the next coherent word does not lead us to the right answer.”\nThe other factor is that AI aims to please; research has shown that chatbots often tell people what they want to hear. In this case that means taking you at your word that “you can’t lick a badger twice” is an accepted turn of phrase. In other contexts, it might mean reflecting your own biases back to you, as a team of researchers led by Xiao demonstrated in a study last year.\n“It’s extremely difficult for this system to account for every individual query or a user’s leading questions,” says Xiao. “This is especially challenging for uncommon knowledge, languages in which significantly less content is available, and minority perspectives. Since search AI is such a complex system, the error cascades.”\nCompounding these issues is that AI is loath to admit that it doesn’t know an answer. When in doubt, it makes stuff up.\n“When people do nonsensical or ‘false premise’ searches, our systems will try to find the most relevant results based on the limited web content available,” said Google spokesperson Meghann Farnsworth in an emailed statement. “This is true of search overall, and in some cases, AI Overviews will also trigger in an effort to provide helpful context.”\nGoogle won’t return an AI Overview result for every query like this. “I did about five minutes of experimentation, and it’s wildly inconsistent, and that’s what you expect of GenAI, which is very dependent on specific examples in training sets and not very abstract,” says Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and author of Taming Silicon Valley: How We Can Ensure That AI Works for Us. “The idea that any of this mess is close to AGI [artificial general intelligence] is preposterous.”\nThis specific AI Overview quirk seems ultimately harmless, and again, it’s a fun way to procrastinate. But it’s helpful to keep in mind that the same model coughing up that confident mistake is the one behind your other AI-generated query results. Take it with a grain of salt.",

    "content_text": "Kyle Brett had a feeling Sinners, the new supernatural horror from Black Panther director Ryan Coogler, would have a big opening weekend—but he was also hyper aware of the consequences of failure.\n“It’s already extremely hard to have a successful original horror movie or just any original movie,” Brett, a former Netflix lawyer who works as a creative executive at Blumhouse, the production company behind M3GAN, Get Out, and the Insidious franchise, tells WIRED. “If that shit had bombed, original film would have truly gone away.”\nThe night before its US release, Brett predicted on X that Sinners would clear $60 million, based “on nothing but the number of Black folks who have asked me about it.” In the business of Hollywood, nothing is guaranteed, least of all a hit movie that’s based on an untested story. But not only was Sinners a hit, breaking multiple box office records, it’s becoming a full-on cultural phenomenon, complete with memes and literary deep dives.\nPerhaps most importantly, it has challenged what’s become conventional wisdom in show business: the idea that audiences won’t respond to original stories.\nSinners has almost everything you could possibly want out of an original film: sex, vampires, a haunting score by composer Ludwig Göransson, and Michael B. Jordan in maybe his best performance yet. The movie opens in Jim Crow–era Mississippi during 1932 and follows identical twin brothers Smoke and Stack, both played by Jordan, who have returned home after time away in Chicago, where they moonlighted as gangsters for Al Capone. They’ve come back to start a juke joint but are put to the test when a coven of vampires encroaches on their new business. Across its two-hour-plus run time, what unfolds is classic Coogler: a lush, complex story about family, community, and survival that dares to reinvent the horror genre into something new altogether.\nThe premise has resonated with audiences in such a powerful way that Sinners opened with $48 million domestically and $63.5 million globally, making it the biggest debut for an original film since 2019, when Jordan Peele’s Us opened to $70 million. (The anticipation surrounding a new Coogler project likely also played a role.) Sinners likewise surpassed Nope, also by Peele—which pulled in $44 million its first weekend in 2022—as the biggest opening for an original film since the pandemic began. It is now the only horror flick in over 35 years to receive an “A” on CinemaScore.\n“IPs are a comfortable, safe bet, but originals, when you have something that right out the gate can connect with audiences, they can have as big a punch,” says Daniel Loria, an analyst at the Boxoffice Company. “That’s definitely what we’re seeing.”\nIt can still be hard to pinpoint exactly what kind of movie works best in Hollywood these days. The success of big-budget blockbusters—Dune, Barbie, Wicked—aren’t exactly a litmus test of how well the industry is faring or what audiences are ultimately satisfied with. Certain IP, like The New Mutants from 2020, bomb or never take off for a number of reasons; often it has to do with earnings, but poor reviews and studio mismanagement can also be a factor.\n“Some franchises are past their best and haven’t performed. This happens every decade or so, which means the studios are looking at new franchise stories to take forward,” says David Hancock, an analyst at Omdia. “A Quiet Place did this. Minecraft may do it.”\nMinecraft, a Warner Bros. property, currently holds the top spot at the worldwide box office, with $720 million, and is estimated to eventually top $1 billion. Video game IP is especially hot right now. The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released by Universal Pictures in 2023, topped $1.3 billion. Paramount’s Sonic the Hedgehog has yielded major dividends for the studio. Until Dawn and Mortal Kombat 2 are also slated to drop this year.\nOne of the things Sinners got right, Brett says, “is that they treated themselves like they were IP.” That means, per his agreement with Warner Bros., Coogler gets the rights to his film back in 25 years—the type of deal that’s mostly unheard of today. Some studio executives believe it sets a “very dangerous precedent” for copyright ownership and distribution entitlements, Vulture reported, saying it will crater the current power dynamics of the studio system, “effectively imperiling the cinematic back catalogue: the core asset behind all movie-studio valuation.” But “that’s the kind of attitude you need with an original,” Brett says. “It's like, No, this is my intellectual property.”\nFor a time, a new Marvel epic was a proven seat filler, but the fatigue and declining critical reception around superhero movies that has bubbled up in recent years—a consequence of Marvel flooding the market with comic book IP—means that is no longer the case. Marvel is currently in rebound mode. It dropped Jonathan Majors, who was a rising star in the MCU, in light of his domestic assault case (he was found guilty of two out of four charges), and The Marvels became the studio’s lowest-grossing film across its 33 titles, earning $206 million globally, well below its $374 million budget.\nIt’s “hard to reinvent that form, and I think this next generation is looking for ways to tell their own stories that service their own sort of collective ADHD,” Avengers: Endgame codirector Joe Russo told GamesRadar+ last year, likening young moviegoers’ communication style to “memes and headlines.”\nNot all original films are seeing a huge demand, as the age of streamers has reshaped consumption habits. As of March, movie sales in the US and Canada were down 7 percent this year compared to the same period in 2024, according to Comscore.\nIn a recent interview with The Independent, director Steven Soderbergh bemoaned that very reality. His latest feature, Black Bag, a spy thriller starring Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender that was released in theaters last month, has yet to turn a profit; it pulled in $37 million worldwide on a budget of $50 million. “This is the kind of film I made my career on,” Soderbergh said in the interview. “And if a mid-level budget, star-driven movie can’t seem to get people over the age of 25 years old to come out to theaters—if that’s truly a dead zone—then that’s not a good thing for movies. What’s gonna happen to the person behind me who wants to make this kind of film?”\nStill, the success of Sinners offers a beacon of hope. It’s currently on track to have a second weekend increase, which “would be much more impressive for a non-IP April release,” Erik Anderson, the founder of Awards Watch, noted on X. It also belongs to a cohort of original films, many centered around identity, from directors that have also found audiences, commercial appeal, and critical acclaim in recent years, including Celine Song’s Past Lives, Cord Jefferson’s American Fiction, Lawrence Lamont’s One of Them Days, and Sean Baker’s Anora, which won Best Picture at this year’s Academy Awards.\nHancock predicts the “next decade will see a return to original stories” as a bid to bring in a wider range of audiences.\nBut the takeaway from Sinners and other movies like it go beyond just IP fatigue, says Brett, noting that these films—and their unique audiences—need to be adequately marketed and prioritized.\n“If there is anything Hollywood misses it’s how much Black audiences will continually engage with them,” he says. “It’s not just like this one-time-customer type of thing. People will return to Sinners. The excitement of it, to me, shows that it has a long shelf life.”",

They’ve come back to start a juke joint but are put to the test when a coven of vampires encroaches on their new business.

    "content_text": "On an isolated farm at the outer reaches of a fascist empire, a mid-level government toady interrogates his victims. Under the guise of conducting a government census, he’s sniffing out undocumented immigrants. When he finds one, he pounces, cornering a young migrant worker and attempting to coerce her into sleeping with him. When she refuses, he gets violent.\nIt’s a scene that feels familiar in America today, where ICE agents are rounding up immigrants (and sometimes even citizens) with disturbing impunity. But in this case, the farm isn’t in the US or even on Earth. Instead, it’s a scene from the second and final season of Andor, the critically acclaimed Star Wars show that chronicles the rise of the Rebel Alliance under the creeping shadow of the Galactic Empire.\nIf watching the new season of Andor makes you think of America’s current lurch toward fascism, that’s likely not a coincidence. In fact, it’s arguably the point of Star Wars in the first place. Throughout the franchise’s 47-year history, the Empire has served as a stand-in for everything from the United States during the Vietnam War to ancient Rome in the age of Julius Caesar. But while the Empire may be infinitely adaptable as a metaphor for fascism, Andor notably seems to represent the first time since Disney purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion that this metaphor is being pointed back at the US.\n“The Empire is both incredibly stable and incredibly flexible as an entity to hang metaphors on,” says Chris Kempshall, a historian and the author of The History and Politics of Star Wars. “We, the audience, understand that the Empire is evil, so that doesn’t need to be explained to us. But the details of the Empire have changed a lot over time to adapt to these changes in real-world politics.”\nUntil now, the Disney era of Star Wars has been defined by toothless politics; in Episode VII—The Force Awakens, the bad guys dress and act like generic Nazis, a cartoonish shortcut that establishes them as evil without attempting to say anything deeper about modern imperialism. In general, the sequel trilogy is too busy wrestling with the meaning of Star Wars itself to say anything potent about American politics, and when Disney’s Lucasfilm does take more ambitious narrative swings, like with The Acolyte, it has failed to escape the gravity of corporate demands and a small, loud, toxic fandom determined to drag the franchise to the right both politically and culturally.\nThat’s why Andor feels like such a rare victory for Star Wars. Not only is it the best thing to come out of the franchise in years (as many critics have argued), but it’s Lucasfilm’s most blatant attempt to get back to the type of biting political commentary that defined its pre-Disney era. Andor’s first season may have laid the groundwork with careful character development and world-building, but Season 2 makes good on that promise to deliver something painfully relevant at a time when many Americans are reckoning with the fact that the democracy we once thought was inextinguishable is seemingly crumbling right in front of us.\nIn the first three episodes of Andor Season 2, which started streaming on Disney+ on April 22, one of the show’s many interlocking plotlines takes us to Mina-Rau, an agricultural planet on the outer rim of the Star Wars galaxy, where a group of rebel soldiers are posing as freelance mechanics. The group includes Bix (Adria Arjona), a wanted fugitive hiding out on Mina-Rau without the necessary paperwork. So when a cadre of Imperial soldiers arrives to carry out an unannounced “supply census,” Bix is worried.\n“If they’re checking visas, it’s a problem,” she says.\n“Look, they need the grain,” a local farmer replies. “They know we need help, and they know everyone isn’t legal. How hard they look, what they do—it’s been 10 years since the last audit, nobody’s happy.”\nIn the very next episode, he’ll betray the rebels to the Empire, a reminder of just how difficult it can be to do the right thing in the face of authoritarian power.\nFor Kempshall, Andor’s greatest innovation is the way it exposes the “grassroots elements of fascism.” We all know that Palaptine is evil, but as the series makes clear, it’s the ordinary people just doing their jobs—filing paperwork and enforcing security—who make that evil possible in the first place.\n“These are the ones who’ll kick your door in at 3 am or enforce changing laws,” he says. “They’re the real face of the Empire. And it looks normal and banal and boring and therefore terrifying. It’s the reality of increasing oppression.”\nStar Wars’ tradition of highlighting American imperialism dates back to its earliest days.\nBefore he created Star Wars, Lucas was supposed to direct Apocalypse Now for his friend, Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola. But after the film fell into development hell and he dropped out, Lucas took that Vietnam War setting and transported it into space, turning the Viet Cong into the Rebel Alliance, a ragtag army of freedom fighters engaged in guerrilla warfare against a heavily armed, genocidal empire.\nAnd that’s just what made it into the final version of the film.\n“In the earliest drafts for what would become Star Wars, Lucas was pretty explicit about how the Empire was meant to portray an America which had fallen into fascism,” Kempshall says.\nWhen Lucas returned to the Star Wars galaxy after a 16-year break to helm the prequel trilogy, he had a different metaphor in mind. Released in 1999, a full year before George W. Bush became president, Star Wars: Episode I—The Phantom Menace is an allegory for how democracies collapse into dictatorship and willingly cede power to a strongman, with parallels to everyone from Julius Caesar to Napoleon Bonaparte. (Lucas’ then-yawn-inducing obsession with trade tariffs may have inadvertently also predicted our current economic crisis.)\nBut by the time the prequels came to an end with Revenge of the Sith (2005), Lucas had turned his attention to President Bush. Near the end of the movie, a corrupted Anakin Skywalker turns to his old friend Obi-Wan Kenobi and shouts, “If you’re not with me, you’re my enemy,” an unsubtle reference to the Iraq War that instantly drew comparisons to Bush’s post-9/11 threat: “Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.”\nAfter the poorly reviewed sequels, Lucas stepped back from Star Wars for another few decades before ultimately selling the franchise to Disney. The company’s much-hyped relaunch picked up the Skywalker Saga, 30 years after Return of the Jedi (1983). In 2015’s The Force Awakens, the remnants of the Empire have reformed into the First Order, which takes on distinctly Nazi attributes with its billowing red flags and angry, shouting leaders.\nFor Kempshall, the reason for this shift toward a more generic Nazi metaphor has less to do with politics and more to do with the modern cultural zeitgeist.\n“Vietnam isn’t a major pop culture touchstone anymore,” he says. “So the Empire likely needed to evolve to transmit a level of evil.”\nThat was certainly true in 2015, a year before Donald Trump became president, but a decade later, the zeitgeist has changed again. Like it did in the 1970s under Richard Nixon or the early 2000s under Bush, America is lurching toward fascism. And, in a surprising return to form, Star Wars is here to reflect that political reality back at us.",

Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nEarly Amazon Book Sale Deals\nThe Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (7/10, WIRED Review) launched with some issues, which Amazon has since addressed. This Kindle is a little quirky. It finally has color, and it’s got a long battery life, waterproofness, and wireless charging, but it doesn’t have page-turn buttons, and the display has the refresh lag that plagues all color ebook readers. It’s worth noting that this is only the second real discount we’ve seen on the Kindle Colorsoft since it was released last October, and we haven’t seen it go for any lower than it is right now.\nNew subscribers can get in on this deal, which gets you three months of Kindle Unlimited for just $1. Out of the many random subscriptions I pay for, Kindle Unlimited is my favorite (and WIRED reviewer Simon Hill says it’s one of his favorite ebook subscription services too). It helped me fall back in love with reading. There are thousands of books to choose from, and you can borrow up to 10 at a time. Usually these trials run for one month, though this promotion does circle back around every so often. Note that this trial will automatically renew at $12 per month, so set a reminder to cancel if you’re not interested in subsequent charges.\nAudible is our favorite subscription service for audiobooks, and this deal lets new subscribers check it out for much less money. You can choose one audiobook every month to keep. (Prime members get two per month with this trial.) There are thousands of podcasts, audiobooks, and Audible Original titles. This trial will automatically renew at $15 per month, so set a reminder to cancel if you’re not interested in subsequent charges.\nThis illustrated book features maps and information about 21 different National Parks, from Acadia to Yosemite. There are fun facts about flora and fauna, hidden critters and plants, and more. It’s a good one to add to the bedtime story collection.\nMushrooms are all the rage, as evinced by our wildly popular guide to mushroom coffee. Satisfy your curiosity and learn something new with this detailed look at the diverse functions of fungi, complete with hundreds of full-color images.\nThis contemporary romance is from the same author who wrote Fourth Wing, the wildly popular fantasy series. There are no dragons in this novel, though. Instead, you’ll follow ballerina Allie Rousseau and her complicated love story with rescue swimmer Hudson Ellis.\nPublished 25 years after the original Tipping Point, this book contains a series of stories that re-examine and reframe Gladwell’s original take on social engineering and social science. It touches on the United States opioid epidemic, Ivy League schools, and the Covid-19 pandemic.\nI’ve been meaning to get into Brandon Sanderson’s fantasy worlds, and this box set seems like a good way to pick up a trilogy. There’s debate on the proper order to read his Cosmere books, but the author himself recommends reading the series in sequential order, and this box set gets you the first three. What summer is complete without a page-turner fantasy novel? None, I say.\nI have yet to read this psychological thriller, but a few of the women on the WIRED Reviews team have been raving about it in our group chat. It stars Lowen Ashleigh, a struggling writer; Verity Crawford, an injured best-selling author; and Jeremy Crawford, Verity’s husband, who hires Lowen to finish Verity’s books. Oh, and a manuscript full of dark secrets. What could possibly go wrong? (I’d purchase it as part of the sale, but Verity is also available to borrow for free with Kindle Unlimited!)\nI’m intrigued by this card deck, which is full of ideas for quick and easy meal boards. There are boards for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus cheese boards and dessert boards. There are even boards for vegans. And a build-your-own hot dog board! Absolutely genius. I adore a good grazing board and I feel like half of my meals consist of snack plates. I’m very into the idea of making this process both easier and more inspired. I’ll be purchasing this one!\nThis self-help book is constantly algorithmically recommended to me. It contains the original seven habits from 30 years ago, plus fresh takes on them from the author’s son, Sean Covey. It has thousands of very positive reviews from people who say the book helped them solve their personal problems, from improving relationships to being more productive.\nThis cookbook has voices from many different chefs and culinary backgrounds. It’s a guide to ingredients and seasonings, with information on how to pair them and how to deepen, brighten, and layer your dishes so they always taste as delicious as possible. It has excellent reviews.\nI’m in my Inglourious Basterds era, and thus going to buy this memoir. It details the story of the author and his survival against overwhelming atrocities, as well as his bravery and resilience afterward.\nLooking for a beach read? This is it. This cozy, snacky monster romance is both hilarious and full of smut. At 288 pages, you’ll fly through it, and luckily there are two more books in the series for all of your popcorn-novel needs.",

I'm WIRED's director of business and industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show, Tesla's troubles in China and what it means for Elon Musk's wallet. We're going to talk about how China is the biggest electric-vehicle market in the world and has played a major role in Tesla's growth. But with the US tariffs and rising competition in the country, China may just be done with Tesla. We'll see. I'm joined today by Zeyi Yang, senior writer at WIRED. Zeyi, welcome to the show.\nZeyi Yang: Thanks for having me, Zoë.\nZoë Schiffer: Tesla is scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings today, after a pretty grim quarter for the company's stock price. What are we expecting to see from these results? Because we're recording a few hours before they actually come out.\nZeyi Yang: Exactly. I'm also looking for the result too. But I think we already know that Tesla sales has doing pretty bad in Europe. It may have also been bad in the USA. Really, China may have been one of the last markets where its sales are still doing relatively OK, but we're about to find out. I think from what I saw, the data collected by Chinese industry associates, they're saying that Tesla's doing still OK this year, mostly because they released a new model of their car. But if not for that, maybe it would have went down, too.\nZoë Schiffer: Let's take a bit of a step back, because China has been a really important market for Tesla and for Elon Musk generally. He's a celebrity there, and so is his mom, as you've reported.\nZeyi Yang: Yes, she is.\nZoë Schiffer: Can you talk to me about that relationship? And also, what is Tesla's standing like in China? Is it viewed as a popular, cool car still?\nZeyi Yang: It's still sort of, because for the longest time, Chinese auto brands have been seen as inferior to foreign brands. Tesla still has that halo as this American electric car company. But it's losing it as we speak. Also, when we talk about the relationship between Tesla and China, sometimes I forget how far back it dates. There's one very interesting figure we have to talk about. His name is Zhuanglong. He used to be Chinese minister of industry and information technologies. Basically, the chief ministry of innovations in China. He went to San Francisco in 2008 and tried one of the roadsters, one of the first electric cars that Tesla made. Because he came from the auto industry, he was an electric car nerd. That's how this all started. Then, from Musk's very first visit to China in 2014, he met this guy again. He really tried to push for it to sell his car in China, and later we know he built a Gigafactory in Shanghai in 2020. That's a long history of how Musk and Tesla entered China. But what we know for now is that China is one of the most productive facilities for Tesla. It's also one of the biggest market for Tesla. Tesla absolutely cannot lose China.\nZoë Schiffer: That's fascinating, because we know with other tech companies like Google and Meta, they tried really, really hard to get into China and weren't quite as successful, or completely failed in some cases. But Elon Musk was able to prevail. Do we know why that was?\nZeyi Yang: I think it helps that he's working on a car company instead of a social media company, because there's just so much control over information and the internet in China. Whereas if you're just making a car, it doesn't really go across those red lines that China has. Also, it just helps that China, for the last two decades, has really been thinking, “Maybe I should be betting on electric vehicle as the future of transportation too.” It did welcome Tesla to be a part of its grand experiment, and also investment to build up an EV empire. That's why Tesla become a very central part of it and contributed to what China has achieved so far.\nZoë Schiffer: Well, that leads right into my next question, because China has invested really heavily in electric vehicles. In part, I think, to reduce its dependency on foreign oil imports. How is that going so far?\nZeyi Yang: It's going pretty well, I will say. Yeah. China does not have rich oil reserve, and it has been importing oil from a lot of other places for the longest time. That's why the Chinese government has always been very careful about that, because if, for example, a World War III happens, those oil supply are going to be cut off. What is it going to do? I think in the early days, I will say the early 2000s, the idea of electric vehicles was this moonshot idea. Where they were thinking, “Maybe, if one day all the cars will be powered by electricity, then we don't need to import this oil anymore and we'll be much more secure if war breaks out.” That's when they really started investing in the research of batteries and electric vehicles with college research funds. But then, that gradually led to Chinese companies building up. They heavily subsidize any car company that can make a product that gets to run on the road and customers can buy. All of that, after years of heavy spending, led to what we have right now, which is a booming electric vehicle market in China. I think the latest data says that more than 50 percent of consumers when they're trying to buy a new car, they go for electric rather than a gas car. That's pretty remarkable.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, that's really interesting. It's also something we're hearing a lot about now. We're seeing people close to President Trump saying, “Hey, look at China. They really help their homegrown tech companies, and now China seems to be beating us in key markets.” It's this idea that perhaps the US government should have a friendlier relationship with the tech companies that are created in the United States.\nZeyi Yang: Well, I will say it's more of a love and hate relationship between the Chinese government and their homegrown companies, because we definitely have seen the honeymoon eras where they subsidize them, where they get the domestic market and drive out all of the foreign competitors. But also, there are periods, I think around 2020, when they really cracked down on the tech companies like Alibaba and Tencent. It can backfire. The government can help you, but it can also destroy you.\nZoë Schiffer: OK. Who is Tesla's biggest competition in the country right now? Which cars are we seeing become more popular than Tesla?\nZeyi Yang: There are so many, I will say dozens of EV brands in China right now. The leader is probably BYD, just because of its sheer size. A Chinese company that started by making batteries and small electronics, BYD now is I think the biggest electric vehicle company in the world, in terms of the number of cars they sell. Bigger than Tesla. Of course, they're growing in China and they're selling their cars much cheaper and in much more varieties in China. But we're also seeing a few more electric car—I will call say “startups,” because they were funded in the last 10 years or so—but still they are big players in the Chinese market now too. They are Neo, they are Li Auto. These companies have really risen up from having nothing to become big players, pushing affordable and also capable cars to the market now.\nZoë Schiffer: When we hone in on BYD specifically, what is that car like compared to a Tesla? I guess I want your subjective opinion now. Are they better or are they just cheaper?\nZeyi Yang: I think the biggest thing is that they come in more variety. You will get a very cheap car, for example, I don't know, a Toyota Corolla, something similar to that, but in an EV form by BYD. Or if you want a luxury SUV, you want something that you can show off to your friends, BYD offers that too. Where Tesla really only has, what, three models being offered right now? It's hard to compete with them when you know consumers want very different things. The other thing I find really interesting is that because, I guess Chinese EV companies are already pretty confident with the quality of their cars now, they're going for those very niche, very weird applications. They're making cars that can run in water, like turn into a boat. They're making cars that allow you to play computer games, and they even have a hot pot in there. Not everyone's going to use it like that, but maybe someone will see that and be like, “I want a car that allows me to do that once in a year.”\nZoë Schiffer: Oh my gosh. Well, as someone who really liked the show Pimp My Ride on MTV when I was younger, maybe this was what I need in my life. We'll be right back. When we return, what does this mixed economic outlook mean for Elon Musk's wallet?\n[break]\nZoë Schiffer: The outlook seems mixed for Elon Musk's future in China, or Tesla's future in China I should say. What does this mean for him, and specifically his overall wealth?\nZeyi Yang: I will say that, first of all, he really wants to make sure the factory in Shanghai keeps producing more cars, because it is the most productive plant in Tesla. He wants it to keep churning out cars. But if the foreign demand doesn't catch up, then what are these cars for? We know right now it's mostly for I would say the European market and also the Chinese domestic market. He's proud that these factories are running 24/7. If that doesn't happen, it would really hurt the Shanghai factory's efficiency, and that would not be good for him.\nZoë Schiffer: Musk is in an interesting position with his business interests in China, particularly as the Trump administration gets more antagonistic toward the Chinese Communist Party. Can you talk about that a little bit? And also, how do you see that playing out?\nZeyi Yang: I think the whole development's very fascinating. One thing I want to mention right now is that, obviously, everyone's talking about the tariffs. The Chinese government and Chinese people hate that Trump is slapping at 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports. Musk actually doesn't like that. He said it publicly on X, that he doesn't think the tariffs are a good idea. That is because if you are a multinational company doing business in US and China, you are going to be impacted by those tariffs. The cars made in the Shanghai factory aren't shipped to the United States, but maybe they're trading car parts in emergencies maybe, or there's some kind of business developed between the countries that will be cut off by these tariffs. That's not good new for him. I think that's a good example to show that, even though we know Musk and Trump are in this very close alliance, there's still diverging interests between them. How to handle business deals with China, how to handle the private sector connections with China, that is one thing I think they will disagree on.\nZoë Schiffer: We know from other reporting that Elon tried to privately lobby Trump against the tariffs on China, and ultimately he appears to have been unsuccessful, at least so far. It's interesting to see it play out, because these men seem very interested in their own bottom line and their own business interests. When those interests align, they get along really well, but China is this point where they seem to diverge, like you said, quite intensely. I'm curious if that will become a breaking point in the relationship, or if they'll be able to resolve their differences.\nZeyi Yang: Yeah. The other thing I want to point out is that, for the longest time, China, both the Chinese people and the government, have really viewed Musk as one of their friends. They came here, helped us prop up the electric vehicle industry, and are still contributing a lot of tax dollars from their Shanghai Tesla factory. Now I think they're figuring out what's their new attitude to Musk. It's like, “He's still doing all of those things. His company is still contributing to our economy.” But at the same time, he's a close ally of Trump who's absolutely wreaking havoc on our economy. What do we see there? When I go on social media and just watch how people comment about Musk, I see a lot of mix there. There's people who still see him as the future of technology. But then there are people who are like, “Why don't you say something about the tariffs?”\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. It's so interesting. It'll be very curious to see whether his celebrity status starts to fade. Or even, we've seen in the United States and Europe, if this symbol of what a Tesla means, it used to be this very cool, environmental symbol, become something different altogether. We've all seen those bumper stickers that are like, “I bought this Tesla before Elon Musk went crazy,” or whatever.\nZeyi Yang: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: I think the point where we know it's really shifted is when Maye Musk's popularity starts to decline, because you've reported that she's an enormous celebrity in China.\nZeyi Yang: Oh, that would be a big change, for sure. I don't see that happening yet, but maybe soon.\nZoë Schiffer: We're going to take another short break. When we come back, we'll share our recommendations for what to check out on WIRED.com this week.\n[break]\nZoë Schiffer: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry. I'm joined by WIRED senior writer Zeyi Yang. Before we take off, Zeyi, tell our listeners what they absolutely need to read on WIRED.com today.\nZeyi Yang: I will say it's the story about how DOGE is building a massive immigration database, by my colleagues Makena Kelly and Vittoria Elliott. I read the story on Monday morning when I was just coming back from work and my head was blown. I was like, “Oh, wow.” It's connecting so many dots of our previous DOGE reporting, including some by you, Zoë. I remember when I was reading all of those previous stories, I was thinking that, “Why do they want all of this data? What is it going to be of use to them?” Now we're finally connecting dots, like, “Hey, maybe this is what they were going for.” I think that's a much better explainer of the whole DOGE operation to me. The last thing is that, I don't know, there are just so many granular details in that story. Absolutely everyone should read it.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I completely agree. I think one thing we were wondering from the very early days of DOGE, because we saw them sucking up all of this data, or at least accessing it in a lot of different ways. The question was why, like you said. Now we know at least one use might be to track people coming into this country.\nZeyi Yang: I have to say that, as someone from China, this is something people are always afraid of the Chinese government doing. They're saying that, “Well, you obviously have a lot of data of the Chinese people already. Please do not connect them and build it into a central database to surveil everyone.” Now we're seeing a similar kind of thing being built in the US, and that makes me even more scared.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, completely. OK. Well, my recommendation is a story that you wrote. You took your Saturday and probably some of your Friday to write about this humanoid robot half-marathon. It was a half-marathon that humans were running in, but also about 21 robots were running in. I think it was the first time we've seen this happen. You wrote this really charming, funny, scary at points dispatch from the race. Maybe because you're here, you can just give us a little bit of an overview, because the robots didn't do that well, right?\nZeyi Yang: No. Unfortunately, no. I was expecting them to do a little bit better, but no. Basically, on Saturday morning in China, this was this half-marathon race in Beijing where 21 robot teams participated. Only six of them actually finished the race, and only one of them made it into the cut of time for human athletes. From that you know they're not doing great. But also, just the literal ways that they fall and fail, it's hilarious. One of them, I remember so clearly. First of all, I don't think it actually worked. It used propellers, like drone propellers to push the robot forward. It immediately lost its direction, twirled in two circles, and fell. And dragged down the human operators too, which was really, really painful. I think it's a good example of saying that robots can do impressive things now, like for example finishing a half-marathon. But at the same time, there are a lot of problems we need to address. Definitely not every company is getting to that level.\nZoë Schiffer: Honestly, it comforts me a little bit that there are some things that they're still worse at than humans, although I'm sure it will change soon. That's our show for today. We'll link to all the stories we spoke about in the show notes.

And also, what is Tesla's standing like in China? Is it viewed as a popular, cool car still?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zeyi Yang:</strong> It's still sort of, because for the longest time, Chinese auto brands have been seen as inferior to foreign brands. Tesla still has that halo as this American electric car company. But it's losing it as we speak. Also, when we talk about the relationship between Tesla and China, sometimes I forget how far back it dates. There's one very interesting figure we have to talk about. His name is Zhuanglong. He used to be Chinese minister of industry and information technologies. Basically, the chief ministry of innovations in China. He went to San Francisco in 2008 and tried one of the roadsters, one of the first electric cars that Tesla made. Because he came from the auto industry, he was an electric car nerd. That's how this all started. Then, from Musk's very first visit to China in 2014, he met this guy again. He really tried to push for it to sell his car in China, and later we know he built a Gigafactory in Shanghai in 2020. That's a long history of how Musk and Tesla entered China. But what we know for now is that China is one of the most productive facilities for Tesla. It's also one of the biggest market for Tesla. Tesla absolutely cannot lose China.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> That's fascinating, because we know with other tech companies like Google and Meta, they tried really, really hard to get into China and weren't quite as successful, or completely failed in some cases. But Elon Musk was able to prevail. Do we know why that was?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zeyi Yang:</strong> I think it helps that he's working on a car company instead of a social media company, because there's just so much control over information and the internet in China. Whereas if you're just making a car, it doesn't really go across those red lines that China has. Also, it just helps that China, for the last two decades, has really been thinking, “Maybe I should be betting on electric vehicle as the future of transportation too.” It did welcome Tesla to be a part of its grand experiment, and also investment to build up an EV empire. That's why Tesla become a very central part of it and contributed to what China has achieved so far.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> Well, that leads right into my next question, because China has invested really heavily in electric vehicles. In part, I think, to reduce its dependency on foreign oil imports. How is that going so far?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zeyi Yang:</strong> It's going pretty well, I will say. Yeah. China does not have rich oil reserve, and it has been importing oil from a lot of other places for the longest time. That's why the Chinese government has always been very careful about that, because if, for example, a World War III happens, those oil supply are going to be cut off. What is it going to do? I think in the early days, I will say the early 2000s, the idea of electric vehicles was this moonshot idea. Where they were thinking, “Maybe, if one day all the cars will be powered by electricity, then we don't need to import this oil anymore and we'll be much more secure if war breaks out.” That's when they really started investing in the research of batteries and electric vehicles with college research funds. But then, that gradually led to Chinese companies building up. They heavily subsidize any car company that can make a product that gets to run on the road and customers can buy. All of that, after years of heavy spending, led to what we have right now, which is a booming electric vehicle market in China. I think the latest data says that more than 50 percent of consumers when they're trying to buy a new car, they go for electric rather than a gas car. That's pretty remarkable.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Margaret Mitchell is a pioneer when it comes to testing generative AI tools for bias. She founded the Ethical AI team at Google, alongside another well-known researcher, Timnit Gebru, before they were later both fired from the company. She now works as the AI ethics leader at Hugging Face, a software startup focused on open source tools.\nWe spoke about a new dataset she helped create to test how AI models continue perpetuating stereotypes. Unlike most bias-mitigation efforts that prioritize English, this dataset is malleable, with human translations for testing a wider breadth of languages and cultures. You probably already know that AI often presents a flattened view of humans, but you might not realize how these issues can be made even more extreme when the outputs are no longer generated in English.\nMy conversation with Mitchell has been edited for length and clarity.\nReece Rogers: What is this new dataset, called SHADES, designed to do, and how did it come together?\nMargaret Mitchell: It's designed to help with evaluation and analysis, coming about from the BigScience project. About four years ago, there was this massive international effort, where researchers all over the world came together to train the first open large language model. By fully open, I mean the training data is open as well as the model.\nHugging Face played a key role in keeping it moving forward and providing things like compute. Institutions all over the world were paying people as well while they worked on parts of this project. The model we put out was called Bloom, and it really was the dawn of this idea of “open science.”\nWe had a bunch of working groups to focus on different aspects, and one of the working groups that I was tangentially involved with was looking at evaluation. It turned out that doing societal impact evaluations well was massively complicated—more complicated than training the model.\nWe had this idea of an evaluation dataset called SHADES, inspired by Gender Shades, where you could have things that are exactly comparable, except for the change in some characteristic. Gender Shades was looking at gender and skin tone. Our work looks at different kinds of bias types and swapping amongst some identity characteristics, like different genders or nations.\nThere are a lot of resources in English and evaluations for English. While there are some multilingual resources relevant to bias, they're often based on machine translation as opposed to actual translations from people who speak the language, who are embedded in the culture, and who can understand the kind of biases at play. They can put together the most relevant translations for what we're trying to do.\nSo much of the work around mitigating AI bias focuses just on English and stereotypes found in a few select cultures. Why is broadening this perspective to more languages and cultures important?\nThese models are being deployed across languages and cultures, so mitigating English biases—even translated English biases—doesn't correspond to mitigating the biases that are relevant in the different cultures where these are being deployed. This means that you risk deploying a model that propagates really problematic stereotypes within a given region, because they are trained on these different languages.\nSo, there's the training data. Then, there's the fine-tuning and evaluation. The training data might contain all kinds of really problematic stereotypes across countries, but then the bias mitigation techniques may only look at English. In particular, it tends to be North American– and US-centric. While you might reduce bias in some way for English users in the US, you've not done it throughout the world. You still risk amplifying really harmful views globally because you've only focused on English.\nIs generative AI introducing new stereotypes to different languages and cultures?\nThat is part of what we're finding. The idea of blondes being stupid is not something that's found all over the world, but is found in a lot of the languages that we looked at.\nWhen you have all of the data in one shared latent space, then semantic concepts can get transferred across languages. You're risking propagating harmful stereotypes that other people hadn't even thought of.\nIs it true that AI models will sometimes justify stereotypes in their outputs by just making shit up?\nThat was something that came out in our discussions of what we were finding. We were all sort of weirded out that some of the stereotypes were being justified by references to scientific literature that didn't exist.\nOutputs saying that, for example, science has shown genetic differences where it hasn't been shown, which is a basis of scientific racism. The AI outputs were putting forward these pseudo-scientific views, and then also using language that suggested academic writing or having academic support. It spoke about these things as if they're facts, when they're not factual at all.\nWhat were some of the biggest challenges when working on the SHADES dataset?\nOne of the biggest challenges was around the linguistic differences. A really common approach for bias evaluation is to use English and make a sentence with a slot like: “People from [nation] are untrustworthy.” Then, you flip in different nations.\nWhen you start putting in gender, now the rest of the sentence starts having to agree grammatically on gender. That's really been a limitation for bias evaluation, because if you want to do these contrastive swaps in other languages—which is super useful for measuring bias—you have to have the rest of the sentence changed. You need different translations where the whole sentence changes.\nHow do you make templates where the whole sentence needs to agree in gender, in number, in plurality, and all these different kinds of things with the target of the stereotype? We had to come up with our own linguistic annotation in order to account for this. Luckily, there were a few people involved who were linguistic nerds.\nSo, now you can do these contrastive statements across all of these languages, even the ones with the really hard agreement rules, because we've developed this novel, template-based approach for bias evaluation that’s syntactically sensitive.\nGenerative AI has been known to amplify stereotypes for a while now. With so much progress being made in other aspects of AI research, why are these kinds of extreme biases still prevalent? It’s an issue that seems under-addressed.\nThat's a pretty big question. There are a few different kinds of answers. One is cultural. I think within a lot of tech companies it's believed that it's not really that big of a problem. Or, if it is, it's a pretty simple fix. What will be prioritized, if anything is prioritized, are these simple approaches that can go wrong.\nWe'll get superficial fixes for very basic things. If you say girls like pink, it recognizes that as a stereotype, because it's just the kind of thing that if you're thinking of prototypical stereotypes pops out at you, right? These very basic cases will be handled. It's a very simple, superficial approach where these more deeply embedded beliefs don't get addressed.\nIt ends up being both a cultural issue and a technical issue of finding how to get at deeply ingrained biases that aren't expressing themselves in very clear language.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nBeing a parent is an expensive experience. A stroller alone can easily cost over a thousand dollars, not to mention the constant new clothing as children grow, formula and food for them to eat, and the rising costs (and challenge to find) of childcare. Unfortunately, there's no reprieve in sight, especially thanks to the new tariffs.\nWhile there have been delays on some tariffs hitting areas like consumer technology and cars, and tariffs for several countries have pauses until July, tariffs for China have already kicked in at up to 145 percent. A huge percentage of products like car seats and strollers are made in China, putting them immediately under the heat of higher prices. “We’re already seeing a significant—and potentially devastating—impact on the cost of baby items,” says Natalie Gordon, founder and CEO of Babylist.\nMost baby gear brands I reached out to declined to comment on any price increases they expect to see as the tariffs set in. Only one has confirmed for me so far. Cybex, maker of strollers and car seats, sent me the following statement: “Due to the impact of current global trade conditions and ongoing supply chain challenges, pricing adjustments will be implemented effective May 1.” But I wouldn't be surprised if more baby brands are set to follow the same plan, and just have yet to make a public statement about it. It's the same plan I've seen in other categories like digital notebooks.\nBabylist, in contrast to the brands themselves, is a third-party marketplace designed around parenting gear and baby registries, and it is already seeing price changes happen in real time. “Brands are delaying inventory shipments and actively exploring price increases,” says Gordon. “One major stroller brand is considering raising prices by $300 to $400 on some of their most popular models. Others are adjusting prices incrementally, product by product, but these decisions are shifting daily.”\nMade in China\nWith the tariffs hitting China particularly hard, worries about buying a technology device in time were the first concern. But China's also a big maker of baby products, especially some of the big-ticket essential items you'd find on any baby registry. “Ninety-seven percent of strollers and 87 percent of car seats are manufactured in China. These aren’t optional purchases. New parents can’t go without them,\" says Gordon.\nThis is especially true for a car seat. Unless you live somewhere with fantastic public transit outside your hospital, something only a few major American cities can claim, you won't be able to take your baby home without a car seat to place them in. Some hospitals even ask that you load your baby into that car seat before you even head out to your car, so they see you do it. Kids also grow into larger car seats and booster seats over the years, all of which could see price hikes.\nGordon's concern with these tariffs are the effect they'll have on safety. “They create an unnecessary and unfair financial burden on families at one of the most vulnerable times in their lives,” she says. “This isn’t just inconvenient—it threatens access to critical child-safety gear. If these tariffs stay in place, we’re looking at skyrocketing costs and potential shortages of must-haves.”\nA Murky Future\nIn a country where there's a push to increase birth rates (and concern about access to abortion rights), it's counterintuitive to see that the cost of having a child is only going to rise. The Trump administration is considering things like a $5,000 baby bonus after giving birth, which often isn't enough for the hospital bill, let alone enough to pay for increasingly expensive safety products.\n“It shouldn’t cost more to become a parent in America,” says Gordon. “These tariffs are essentially a baby tax on already struggling families. And the reality is, you can’t delay essentials like a crib or a car seat—your baby needs them when they need them.”\nCybex also acknowledged the undetermined future (a phrase current parents have already heard time and time again between the pandemic and now) ahead in the company's statement. “While the future remains somewhat uncertain, we understand the challenges facing our customers during these unprecedented times, and we’re continuing to evaluate market dynamics and operational costs in real time.”\nWhere does that leave us? Gordon expects a big move to secondhand purchasing. Babylist recently took a poll and found 67 percent of expecting parents who answered it planned to purchase things secondhand, and there are Facebook communities like Buy Nothing groups and parenting groups where you can find or sell secondhand items. Babylist also has support for this, with an “open to secondhand” option you can add to a baby registry and tips about how to shop secondhand baby gear.\nThe most important product to check if you're shopping secondhand is car seats. These have expiration dates, so be sure to check them if you're shopping for a car seat secondhand.\nWhat to Buy Now\nSo, should you shop now ahead of more tariffs? Gordon says yes. “If you know what you want and you're in a position to purchase directly or share your registry now, it could be a smart move— especially for big-ticket items,” she says.\nWhile Cybex has confirmed increased prices, it's been a maker of some of my favorite baby gear. I'm currently testing the Cybex Callisto G 360 car seat, which is a rotating all-in-one car seat you could use from infant stage all the way until a child is up to 120 pounds. Yes, you read that right—Cybex claims it can fit 10-year-olds with its adjustments. All-in-one car seats like these are a great investment right now, since you won't need to upgrade to a different car seat later, though you'll miss out on the convenience of carrying an infant car seat inside or moving it from the car to a stroller.\nSpeaking of strollers, those are another big-ticket item that can rise in price. The models I've found myself using the longest are actually travel strollers, since these tend to work better with your kid for longer and are more compact to use every day. These have limited compatibility with car seats for infant use, though, and don't face inward (but that's a pretty short-lived stage). My favorite is the Nuna TRVL, but the Bombi Bēbee V2 is pretty similar for a cheaper price, and has car seat adapter straps that work with a ton of popular infant car seat brands like Graco, Nuna, and even Uppababy.\nThere are plenty of other big-ticket items to consider beyond these—cribs! bassinets! breast pumps! baby monitors!—but it's up to you to figure out what to invest in now, and what you might want to gamble on the price of later.",

A stroller alone can easily cost over a thousand dollars, not to mention the constant new clothing as children grow, formula and food for them to eat, and the rising costs (and challenge to find) of childcare. Unfortunately, there's no reprieve in sight, especially thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/tariffs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new tariffs</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">While there have been delays on some tariffs hitting areas like consumer technology and cars, and tariffs for several countries have pauses until July, tariffs for China have already kicked in at <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/economy/china-tariffs-145-percent.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/economy/china-tariffs-145-percent.html\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/business/economy/china-tariffs-145-percent.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">up to 145 percent</a>. A huge percentage of products like car seats and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-stroller-for-kids/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">strollers</a> are made in China, putting them immediately under the heat of higher prices. “We’re already seeing a significant—and potentially devastating—impact on the cost of baby items,” says Natalie Gordon, founder and CEO of <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.babylist.com/index\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.babylist.com/index\" href=\"https://www.babylist.com/index\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Babylist</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">Most baby gear brands I reached out to declined to comment on any price increases they expect to see as the tariffs set in. Only one has confirmed for me so far. Cybex, maker of strollers and car seats, sent me the following statement: “Due to the impact of current global trade conditions and ongoing supply chain challenges, pricing adjustments will be implemented effective May 1.” But I wouldn't be surprised if more baby brands are set to follow the same plan, and just have yet to make a public statement about it. It's the same plan I've seen in other categories like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-smart-notebooks-and-smart-pens/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">digital notebooks</a>.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Babylist, in contrast to the brands themselves, is a third-party marketplace designed around parenting gear and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-registries-for-weddings-baby-showers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">baby registries</a>, and it is already seeing price changes happen in real time. “Brands are delaying inventory shipments and actively exploring price increases,” says Gordon. “One major stroller brand is considering raising prices by $300 to $400 on some of their most popular models. Others are adjusting prices incrementally, product by product, but these decisions are shifting daily.”</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Made in China</h2><p class=\"paywall\">With the tariffs hitting China particularly hard, worries about <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tariffs-are-going-to-make-your-electronics-more-expensive/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">buying a technology device in time were the first concern</a>. But China's also a big maker of baby products, especially some of the big-ticket essential items you'd find on any baby registry. “Ninety-seven percent of strollers and 87 percent of car seats are manufactured in China. These aren’t optional purchases. New parents can’t go without them,\" says Gordon.</p><p class=\"paywall\">This is especially true for a car seat. Unless you live somewhere with fantastic public transit outside your hospital, something only a few major American cities can claim, you won't be able to take your baby home without a car seat to place them in. Some hospitals even ask that you load your baby into that car seat before you even head out to your car, so they see you do it. Kids also grow into larger car seats and booster seats over the years, all of which could see price hikes.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Gordon's concern with these tariffs are the effect they'll have on safety. “They create an unnecessary and unfair financial burden on families at one of the most vulnerable times in their lives,” she says. “This isn’t just inconvenient—it threatens access to critical child-safety gear. If these tariffs stay in place, we’re looking at skyrocketing costs and potential shortages of must-haves.”</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">A Murky Future</h2><p class=\"paywall\">In a country where there's <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/uncanny-valley-podcast-18-babies-repopulation-silicon-valley/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a push to increase birth rates</a> (and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-win-seven-states-vote-abortion-rights/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">concern about access to abortion rights</a>), it's counterintuitive to see that the cost of having a child is only going to rise. The Trump administration is considering things <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/trump-birthrate-proposals.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/trump-birthrate-proposals.html\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/trump-birthrate-proposals.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">like a $5,000 baby bonus</a> after giving birth, which often isn't enough for the hospital bill, let alone enough to pay for increasingly expensive safety products.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“It shouldn’t cost more to become a parent in America,” says Gordon. “These tariffs are essentially a baby tax on already struggling families. And the reality is, you can’t delay essentials like a crib or a car seat—your baby needs them when they need them.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

Muscles adapt in response to the environment: They grow when we put in the work and shrink when we stop. But what if we could help them remember how to grow?\nAs a general rule, cell biologists don’t enter their careers by running through the gauntlet of top-tier professional sports. But in the years that Adam Sharples played as a front-row forward in the UK’s Rugby Football League, he found himself wondering about cell mechanisms that helped muscles to grow after different types of exercise.\nA front-row position in pro rugby means that you have to be, well, “quite big,” as Adam puts it. “I was in the gym lifting weights from the age of about 12, I think,” he says.\nHe spent much of his teenage life in training. When he was 19, he was playing a Boxing Day match on soggy ground that was heavy underfoot. He’d just planted his foot when a player on the opposing team tackled him, torquing his upper body to the left. His right foot remained firmly stuck in the mud.\n“That’s when I tore my ACL, but I don’t remember much about it. You should ask my dad,” Adam tells me with a wry smile. “He could tell you down to the minute, in great detail: when it happened, how it happened.” (Sports, I’m reminded, has the remarkable capacity to be a love language.)\nAdam took a year off from rugby and continued to study, completing his master’s degree in human physiology. He’d always been curious about muscles and muscle growth, but the hiatus gave him time to think—pro rugby players, he was well aware, have notoriously short careers. That acknowledgment eventually led him to pursue a PhD in muscle cell biology.\nWhen we talk about muscle memory, most of the time we refer to the way our bodies seem to remember how to do things that we haven’t done in some time—riding a bike, say, or doing a complicated dance we learned in childhood. When you learn and repeat certain movements over time, that movement pattern becomes refined and regular, and so does the firing pattern of neurons that control that movement. The memory of how to perform that action lives in our motor neurons, not in the actual muscles that are involved. But as Adam proceeded through his academic training, he became more and more interested in the question of whether muscle itself possesses a memory at the cellular and genetic level.\nAlmost two decades later, Adam teaches and runs a lab at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo. In 2018, his research group was the first in the world to show that human skeletal muscle possesses an epigenetic memory of muscle growth after exercise.\nEpigenetic refers to changes in gene expression that are caused by behavior and environment. The genes themselves aren’t changed, but the way they work is. When you lift weights, for instance, small molecules called methyl groups detach from the outside of certain genes, making them more likely to turn on and produce proteins that affect muscle growth. Those changes persist; if you start lifting weights again, you’ll add muscle mass more quickly than before. In other words, your muscles remember how to do it: They have a lasting molecular memory of past exercise that makes them primed to respond to exercise, even after a months-long pause. (Cellular muscle memory, on the other hand, works a little differently than epigenetic muscle memory. Exercise stimulates muscle stem cells to contribute their nuclei to muscle growth and repair, and cellular muscle memory refers to when those nuclei stick around for a while in the muscle fibers—even after periods of inactivity—and help accelerate the return to growth once you start training again.)\nAthletes have always known this to be true, at least anecdotally. After periods of injury, as with a torn ACL, they notice that it’s fairly easy to regain the muscle strength they lost. The joints, though, are another story.\nAdam took his reconstructed knee and ground through another year of pro rugby before retiring for good. In his academic work, he began to investigate the why behind his observations about muscle memory. In doing so, he found a way to grapple with what it means to age as an athlete, and as a human.\n“Looking back, I was probably overtraining in the attempt to be the best I could be,” Adam says. “Because if you can find the exercise that provides your muscle with the longest-lasting memory, or find the type of training that your muscle can respond better to the second time around—after an injury, say, or after taking some time off—then you can potentially reduce the amount of exercise you do for the same benefit.”\nHe laughs. “I could have saved myself some work, I suppose. I’ve got that hindsight now.”\nExcerpt adapted from On Muscle: The Stuff That Moves Us and Why It Matters by Bonnie Tsui. Copyright © 2025 by Bonnie Tsui.

    "content_text": "As the trade war between China and the United States continues to escalate, Beijing is responding by turning to one of its favorite retaliation tactics: limiting the export of critical minerals used in many high-tech electronics, from fighter jets to wind turbines. While China’s mineral restrictions may sound scary, the reality is that they haven’t been very effective in the past and stand to become even less so if the US and other countries finally get their acts together.\nIt all started in July 2023, when the Chinese government announced it would restrict the export of gallium and germanium, two critical minerals that are mostly used in making solar panels and semiconductors. Over the following two years, China’s list of controlled products expanded to include antimony, graphite, and other materials. Earlier this month, the Chinese government escalated things even further, subjecting seven rare earth elements to a more comprehensive export licensing program that covers the whole world and is designed to further choke off American companies.\nRare earths are a subset of elements under the broader umbrella of critical minerals that China has long enjoyed monopoly control over. In the short term, companies that need these rare earths might be able to rely on existing stockpiles or even turn to recycled electronics to find them. But eventually, the US and other countries will be forced to either ramp up domestic mining or reduce their dependence on rare earths, both of which would make China’s policies sting less. “China has got one shot, and it knows it,” says Ian Lange, an associate professor of economics and business at the Colorado School of Mines.\nRare but Not Irreplaceable\nThe export controls China announced earlier this month cover samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium—seven elements that belong to what is known as the rare earth family. They are called “rare” not because of their scarcity but because they often are mixed with other mineral resources and can be hard to separate out.\nThere are 17 rare earth elements in total, but the Chinese government chose these seven because they are part of a smaller subset of “heavy” rare earth minerals that the country has more control over than others, says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. That monopoly was built over decades as China created a robust supply chain for these minerals and the rest of the world turned away from what is a heavily polluting and niche sector. “China processes pretty much 100 percent of the world’s heavy rare earths, which means that they don’t just have a comparative advantage, they have an absolute advantage,” says Baskaran.\nBut the other important thing to know about rare earths is that—while they are used in a wide variety of products—those items typically only contain very small quantities, and often only in supportive roles. Last year, the United States imported about $170 million worth of rare earth elements, including some that China hasn’t restricted yet, according to the United States Geological Survey. For comparison, the US imported over $327 million worth of fresh potatoes and $300 million worth of potato chips between September 2023 and August 2024.\nPerhaps the most important application for rare earth elements is creating magnets that improve the performance of products like electric motors in high temperatures. These magnets can be found in electric vehicles and consumer products like vacuum cleaners.\n“The heavy rare earth elements are added as sort of a spice, a doping agent, to maintain the magnetism of the magnet at high temperatures. It also improves corrosion resistance and the longevity of the magnet,” says Seaver Wang, director of the climate and energy team at the Breakthrough Institute, an Oakland-based think tank.\nBeyond magnets, these rare earth elements can also serve a range of purposes, such as making metal stronger, improving radar systems, and even treating cancer. Without them, in many cases, technological infrastructure and consumer gadgets won’t be able to perform at the same level—but they will still maintain their basic functions. “The wind turbines will just go out of service 10 years earlier; electric vehicles will not last as long,” says Wang.\nLange agrees that the impact of losing access to heavy rare earth elements would be somewhat manageable for American companies. “One place where that rare earth is in your car is in the motors that pull up and down your window,” says Lange. “There are ways to just deal with some things that are not as fun, like rolling down your windows by hand.”\nLoopholes and Workarounds\nIn the past, China’s critical mineral restrictions haven’t worked very well. One reason is that US companies that want to buy rare earth minerals can simply go through an intermediary country first. For example, Belgium has emerged as a possible re-export hub that appears to pass germanium—one of the minerals Beijing first restricted in 2023—from China to the US, according to trade data. Since the European Union has much closer ties with Washington than with Beijing, it’s difficult for the Chinese government to effectively stop this flow of trade.\nAnother sign that China’s export controls haven’t been very effective is that the price of critical minerals has increased only slightly since the policies were first implemented, indicating that supply levels have remained steady. “Whatever they did in 2023 hasn’t really changed the status quo” of the market, says Lange.\nBut China’s latest restrictions are more expansive, and there’s already some evidence that things could be different this time. Companies that need these elements have been forced to buy them from other firms with existing private stockpiles, which have become more valuable in recent weeks. “There is a very steep increase in prices to draw down on stockpiles right now,” says Baskaran, citing conversations she’s had with rare earth traders.\nIn the long run, however, companies may be able to find technological solutions to address a potential shortage of rare earth minerals. Tesla, for example, announced in 2023 that it had reduced the use of them in its EV motors by 25 percent, and it planned to get rid of them completely in the future. The carmaker hasn’t clarified what it would use instead, but experts speculate it could be turning to other types of magnets that don’t rely on rare earths.\nWhere Are the American Mines?\nWhile rare earths, or critical minerals in general, are often cited along with semiconductors as industries the US wants to reshore the most, the challenges associated with bringing each of them back are very different.\nUnlike making advanced semiconductors, which requires using sophisticated machinery worth hundreds of millions of dollars and building extremely complicated factories, critical minerals aren’t that hard to produce. The technologies involved to mine and refine them are mature and both the US and Canada have large natural deposits of some of them. But the mining industry was pushed out of the West because it doesn’t generate much value and is also extremely polluting.\nIn the past, efforts to build up the critical minerals supply chain in the US have either been slowed down or called off. That’s more due to basic economic calculations, says Lange, rather than technological difficulties. “It’s like bending down to pick up a nickel,” he says, meaning the effort isn’t worth the reward.\nBecause companies only need tiny quantities of these minerals, the market for them is very volatile—prices can drop when a single new factory comes online and starts mass producing and refining them. That means if a mining company were to open up shop in the US, it could inadvertently tank the price of the same mineral it’s trying to profit from, says Lange.\nBut if China succeeds in strictly enforcing its export control policies, it might provide just enough incentive for the US government and private companies to finally reshore the mineral refining industry. If that happens, Lange says, it could take about two years for a new critical mineral operation to open in the US.\n“It's really remarkable how China has actually maintained these monopolies in so many critical minerals for 20 years,” says Wang. “But I do think we are maybe starting to turn the corner, where China's market share may be peaking … and you are starting to see a resurgence of interest in these industries in Northern Europe, Australia, Canada, the US, and Latin America.”",

    "content_text": "Since the arrival of nuclear power in the 1950s, more than 400 reactors in 31 countries have produced about 430,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, and until now no one has developed a permanent solution for disposing of it. The International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that about 30 percent of this fuel has been reprocessed—elements in spent fuel can be recycled to create new fuel for nuclear plants—but the rest has been “parked” in temporary storage systems, with its final destination yet to be determined.\nAnd with the nuclear sector showing signs of undergoing a renaissance—as countries look to decarbonize energy production and with the tech sector seeking ways to power its electricity-hungry AI systems—the pressure for nuclear-waste disposal is likely to grow.\nThe best solution would be to put spent fuel in an underground facility that can contain it safely for millennia. Spent fuel is a major threat to human health for at least 10,000 years and remains radioactive for several million. But such facilities have to be built from scratch, and while several are being developed, none have been completed. The leader in this race is Finland, which has dug the underground space needed for a repository.\nOn the country’s west coast, roughly three hours’ drive from the capital, Helsinki, is what will become the country’s first encapsulation plant. Known as Onkalo, it will receive spent fuel from Finland’s five nuclear reactors—three on the nearby island of Olkiluoto and two in Loviisa, in the southeast of the country. The repository is being built by Posiva Oy, a Finnish company set up by two of the country’s nuclear operators in 1995 to find a way of permanently storing spent nuclear fuel.\nIn the bedrock here, at a depth of 430 meters, testing is underway. Storage of spent fuel involves placing spent fuel rods inside copper canisters, which in turn have to be inserted into slots dug into the granite walls of the subterranean repository. Everything is then sealed with bentonite, a soft, plastic clay that insulates the containers and acts as a buffer against minor movements in the bedrock.\nIn mid-March, five test containers, filled with nonradioactive materials, were sealed in a special aboveground facility before being transported underground and stored along a 70-meter-long subterranean tunnel, to provide an initial proof of concept for Onkalo’s storage process. The completion of this dummy run puts Finland in the lead in the race to build the world’s first operational deep geological repository.\nOnkalo’s construction has so far cost €900 million, while an estimated €4 billion more is needed to complete the project. Breaking ground here followed decades of research to find the best location for the repository and years waiting for permits and approvals. There are some who still don’t believe the project will happen and others who hope it won’t. Some locals have been hostile to the project, unhappy with the prospect of nuclear waste being stored nearby and perplexed at how easily, in their opinion, Posiva Oy was able to get permits for the repository. Researchers have also expressed concerns about potential corrosion of storage containers, specifically the copper canisters.\nTogether with his colleagues, Jinshan Pan, a professor of corrosion science at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, published a study in January 2023 devoted to the risk of sulfides in groundwater corroding the copper used for spent nuclear fuel containers. “More work is needed to define […] the nature and chemistry of the surface films that develop on copper surfaces in repository conditions,” the paper says.\nWhile Posiva Oy looks like it may have the first functioning repository, other countries are following its lead. Neighbouring Sweden is also preparing to start work on its own repository, which is intended to contain up to 12,000 metric tons of Swedish spent nuclear fuel. It is expected to extend over 60 kilometers of tunnel once it is finished, at a depth of 500 meters. It is a major work that has been on the drawing table for 40 years and obtained its necessary environmental permits for construction only a few months ago. Construction could start within the next decade and would continue until the 2080s, with this repository’s underground space gradually extending—provided an appeal made by the Office for Nuclear Waste Review, a Swedish NGO, does not slow or halt the work. Concerns about the Swedish project are the same as with the Finnish one: danger of corrosion of the copper canisters, possibly resulting in the release of radioactive elements into the groundwater.\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, Canada is also planning to build a storage facility. The repository doesn’t exist yet, but the path forward appears relatively free of obstacles—at least there are no apparent legal ones. After 14 years of dialog and debates, the relevant bodies and citizens have selected a host site within the Township of Ignace, Ontario, part of the indigenous community the Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation. Both the town and nation were open to the project, seeing it as a source of investments and new jobs.\nFrance and Switzerland are also working on projects, gradually making progress, even if much of it is a matter of getting over bureaucratic hurdles. In the Meuse region of northeastern France, field work on the Cigéo project could begin in 2027 now that it has received a positive assessment of its soundness. The implementing company Andra has been authorized to continue with plans, providing it gives greater consideration to the potential impact of climate change on the aboveground structures.\nIt has taken Switzerland’s national radioactive-waste-disposal cooperative, Nagra, 14 years to decide where to locate its storage facility. It has chosen to build its repository north of Zurich, in Nördlich Lägern, because it is an area particularly rich in very compact opaline clay, which is perfect for acting as a long-term container for radioactive materials. (Finland’s site is also rich in this material.) Final approval is expected around 2030, subject to a referendum, and the repository should start to operate by 2060.\nFinally, Italy is considering 51 sites that could potentially be suitable to host a repository for nuclear waste storage. These plans were first drawn up in 2015 and then published in December 2023. The government has since decided to reopen the application process to accommodate new applications. In the meantime, radioactive waste in the country remains stored in temporary repositories at the sites of decommissioned nuclear power plants, nuclear research facilities, and nuclear medicine and industry locations.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.",

    "content_text": "On Wednesday, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly sued four prominent telehealth companies that offer more affordable, off-brand versions of its patented best-selling GLP-1 medications Mounjaro and Zepbound. Together, the drugs accounted for over $16.4 billion in revenue for the company last year. It’s the latest escalation in an ongoing war between the drug industry and health care providers over what are widely seen as the most effective—and lucrative—drugs for treating obesity and diabetes to come on the market in years.\nThe lawsuits target four telehealth brands, Mochi Health, Fella & Delilah Health, Willow Health, and Henry Meds. Eli Lilly alleges that each company is selling illegal knockoffs of its drugs, in some cases, with untested added ingredients like vitamins and amino acids in an attempt to distinguish them from its name-brand medications.\nNone of the companies named as defendants immediately responded to requests for comment from WIRED about the lawsuits. In response to general questions about its business practices, Mochi Health said in a statement that it offers compounded GLP-1 medications that are “customized for medical necessity.\"\n“Their use remains appropriate and legal when tailored to individual patient needs and prescribed by a licensed medical provider—not as mass-market substitutes for branded medications,” Mochi Health said. Fella & Delilah Health, Willow Health, and Henry Meds did not respond to questions about its business practices in time for publication.\nLilly previously filed other lawsuits against more than a dozen compounding pharmacies, medical spas, and wellness centers for selling drugs claiming to contain tirzepatide, the active ingredient in both Zepbound and Mounjaro.\nMounjaro surged in popularity after it was approved to treat diabetes in May 2022, and the FDA declared some doses of it were in shortage by the end of that year. Zepbound was approved as an obesity treatment in November 2023, with certain doses going into short supply months later. (Novo Nordisk’s competing GLP-1 medications, Ozempic and Wegovy, also went into shortage in 2022.)\nWhen there’s an official shortage of a drug, compounding pharmacies are legally allowed to create duplicate copies or custom-mixed approximations known as “compounds” to meet patient needs. These off-brand versions are not approved by the FDA—but they are often far more affordable than name-brand medications.\nDuring the years-long tirzepatide and semaglutide shortages, which the FDA officially declared over in December and February, compounded GLP-1s became widely available through existing telehealth providers and startups that sprang up specifically to cash in on the new, lucrative health care niche. According to a trade group representing compounders, at least 2 million people in the US were taking these medications as of November last year.\nSome telehealth companies offered vials of tirzepatide for under $100, a fraction of the cost of Mounjaro and Zepbound, and shipped them to patients within days after they filled out a quick online questionnaire.\nWhile most telehealth brands and compounding pharmacies do not disclose their revenue, industry juggernaut Hims said during a recent earnings call that it brought in about $225 million from GLP-1 drug sales last year. (Hims doesn't sell compounded tirzepatide, but recently added branded Zepbound to its offerings.)\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you an employee or patient of a company that sells GLP-1 medications? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at Kateknibbs.09. and emullin.06.\nThe FDA gave compounders a grace period to wind down their production of the drugs after the shortage was over. Small pharmacies had until February 18 to comply, while larger outsourcing facilities had until March 19. (Semaglutide compounders were ordered to cease mass production this spring, with smaller compounders given a deadline of April 22 and outsourcing facilities given until May 22.)\nWhile many compounding pharmacies and telehealth providers have halted production and sales, others have continued to offer tirzepatide products with add-on ingredients, unapproved dosages, or in different forms, such as oral versions. “It’s a minority,” says Jayne Hornung, chief clinical officer at the pharmaceutical analytics company MMIT.\nHornung says that companies continuing to sell tirzepatide are hoping the vitamin additives and other tweaks will allow them to argue they aren’t selling straightforward copies of Lilly’s patented drugs. “They’re getting very creative,” she says.\nCompounding pharmacies are generally permitted to create customized medicines for patients even when they’re not in shortage, such as for individuals who may be allergic to certain ingredients or need carefully calibrated doses. The crux of Lilly’s argument is that, when it comes to tirzepatide, the medications telehealth companies are offering are not truly personalized because they are being mass produced and prescribed to many patients.\n“There are some ways that compounders tailor a medication to the patient, such as by adding another ingredient that might help with a side effect or an additional concern or diagnosis,” says Annie Lambert, a pharmacist and clinical program manager at information services firm Wolters Kluwer. “But there needs to be good science and evidence behind the safety of combining those things.\"\nMass-producing compounded versions of existing drugs with additives was not widespread until recently, according to Nicole Snow, a pharmacist at the compounding company Olympia Pharmaceuticals, which previously produced compounded tirzepatide but stopped after the shortage ended and never included additives. “We’d seen it from time to time, but not in this magnitude,” she says. “It wasn’t a very popular thing until we got into GLP-1s.”\nIn its suit against Mochi, Eli Lilly claims the telehealth company “switched dosages and prescriptions for patients en masse at least five times—with corporate interests, rather than doctor decisionmaking—driving the changes.”\nThose changes, Lilly alleges, included creating two new formulas containing a niacinamide additive and pyridoxine, both forms of vitamin B that the pharma company argues have not been proven to be safe or effective when combined with tirzepatide. Mochi’s own compounder, Aequita Pharmacy, made some of those products. In March, regulators in Washington state ordered production to be halted at Aequita Pharmacy, citing safety violations connected to GLP-1 medications.\nIn another lawsuit filed in the same California court, Lilly claims that Fella & Delilah Health switched all of its patients from a compounded tirzepatide product with no additives to a version containing untested amino acid additives late last year.\nThe pharmaceutical giant’s lawsuit against Henry Meds, which offers oral and injectable GLP-1 medications, accuses the company of “creating the false impression” that clinical trials have confirmed the effectiveness of its drugs, “materially omitting that no such clinical trial data exists.”\nLilly’s lawsuit against Willow Health Services alleges that the Texas-based telehealth company falsely markets some of its products, such as an oral droplet GLP-1 drug and a version of compounded tirzepatide with added niacinamide added, as “custom-prepared” for patients despite being mass-produced.\nSome companies selling compounded GLP-1 meds are unlikely to stop without a fight. A compounding trade group has filed a set of lawsuits against the FDA on behalf of clients, arguing that the agency prematurely declared the GLP-1 shortages over. Whether or not their legal efforts are successful, there’s still a possibility that the drugs could once again go into shortage if demand continues to rise. As new research continues to point to additional medical uses for these drugs, that may very well happen.\n“Pharmacies compound medication all the time, and there are no lawsuits about it because they’re not trying to compete with drug companies,” Lambert says. “This is so contentious because there’s so much money at stake.”\nUpdate 4/23/2025, 7:06 AM ET: This article was updated to clarify the exact nature of Eli Lilly's complaint.\nCorrection 4/23/2025, 12:40 PM ET: This story has been corrected to note that Hims has never sold compounded tirzepatide.",

    "content_text": "In the arid region south of Mexicali, where the pale desert dominates the landscape, the Las Arenitas wetland feels like a mirage. But it is real, and is an oasis for endemic and migratory birds that cross the Colorado River delta. Here, just south of the US-Mexico border, used water from the city of Mexicali gets a second life. Half of it goes to the nearby Hardy River, in an attempt to revive ecosystems that were thought to be irrecoverable.\nHistorically, waterways here have been flushed full of sewage—particularly the New River, which runs off from the Colorado River northwards, crossing from Mexico into the United States and ending in the Salton Sea in California. For many years, this water course received untreated sewage from Mexicali, rendering it one of the worst-polluted rivers of its size in the US. In the 1990s, American and Mexican authorities could no longer ignore how bad the problem had become, and they began collaborating on infrastructure to lessen the pollution. And so, in 2007, south of Mexicali, the Las Arenitas treatment plant began operations.\nMexicali, which sits right on the border, generates more than 80 million cubic meters of sewage a year. Of that total, 90 percent is collected, with 46 percent of that going to Las Arenitas.\nIn the sewage plant, solids and sediments are first removed from the wastewater. Next, surface-aerated lagoons are used, where air is injected into the water to stimulate the growth of aerobic bacteria, which decompose organic matter in the presence of oxygen. The water then passes to facultative lagoons, where aerobic and anaerobic bacteria complement each other, the latter degrading organic matter that the former could not. Finally, the water reaches the maturation lagoons, where the remaining solids settle out.\nWhen it launched, this new system worked. “In the beginning, the plant did not perform ideally,” says Edith Santiago, deputy director of the Colorado River delta program in Mexicali at the conservation nonprofit the Sonoran Institute. To combat this, some organizations proposed to the water management agency that they should use the surrounding land, which decades ago housed a lake, to create an artificial wetland that would give the water additional cleanliness.\nSuch a plan, as well as helping with the city’s sewage problem, would also help partially restore the local landscape to its former state. Before the overexploitation of the Colorado River, its delta crossed Baja California and Sonora until it met the waters of the Gulf of California, resulting in more than 400,000 hectares of wetlands. Although the river’s course has become a ghost, about 15 percent of those wetlands have survived, harboring an invaluable biodiversity of plants and animals. Seeking to mimic that strength, the Las Arenitas artificial wetland is a pause to the devastation of the local landscape.\nConstruction of the wetlands began in 2009, a collaboration between the federal and state governments, water agencies, and investments obtained by the conservation nonprofit Pronatura Noroeste and the Sonoran Institute. In addition, they replaced obsolete equipment and made repairs to the plant.\n“Wetlands are the kidneys of the planet—they help to filter and clean the water, to remove particles through the different plants,” explains Santiago. This process, where plants naturally cleanse water, is known as phytoremediation, and it occurs both underground in the roots of tule and alkaline reed, but also on the surface of the wetland waters, where microorganisms that degrade pollutants live.\nMicroscopic life within the wetlands cleanses the water in diverse ways, such as by transforming nitrogen into other substances and by assimilating phosphorus into its own biomass. In addition, physical processes such as sedimentation occur, in which smaller particles fall to the bottom of the water body.\nThe wetlands’ battle to maintain their balance is titanic, as the water treatment plant has been operating above capacity since 2013. The plant has an installed capacity of 840 liters per second, but it reaches 1,044 liters per second in some months. An expansion of the plant, while urgent, is yet to happen—though it has been on the table for more than five years.\nIt’s possible to smell when the wetland ecosystem is out of kilter: The decomposition of organic matter there can generate unpleasant odors when these systems are under stress or out of balance, giving the environment an earthy, pungent aroma.\nAssessing the quality of the treatment system’s discharges is costly, and Santiago points out that there are two key things that could improve the processing of the water here further still: “Implementing better water use in the city, and new technology such as activated sludge in the plant, which uses less space than the lagoons and is faster.”\nWhen the wetland was designed, it was agreed that 30 percent of its annual water volume would flow along the Hardy River to the south for environmental use—that is, to sustain the life of this river, but also for the benefit of local communities, among them, the Cucapa indigenous group. The amount flowing into the Hardy River has now risen to 50 percent. “That the water from Las Arenitas flows along the Hardy River generates environmental potential; many species of birds and other wildlife use this area or live in it,” says Santiago.\nRe-creating wetlands in the region also has a unique ecological benefit. In 2009, the first bird census in the area yielded about eight species and fewer than 100 birds in total. Six years later, researchers counted 160 different species, with a peak count of 18,000 birds. They have recorded Yuma clapper rails, brown pelicans, peregrine falcons, and northern shovelers.\nAn assessment of ecosystem services provided by the wetlands in the arid zone of Mexicali, published in 2023, highlighted the system’s high potential for regulating water flows, promoting environmental education, and recharging the local aquifer.\nThat last point is an important one. The city of Mexicali depends on the Colorado River and its underground water reserves, but it uses water at an unsustainable rate. Annual recharge of the Mexicali Valley aquifer is 520.5 cubic hectometers (hm3), but more water is withdrawn from this underground store each year than reenters it (783.12 hm3). Meanwhile, the Colorado River is being squeezed to exhaustion, and is approaching a collapse that climate change is accelerating. Without Las Arenitas, the situation would be even worse, but drastically more needs to be done to balance the region’s water use.\n“My dream for Las Arenitas is that the community will come to enjoy it, but, at the same time, that there will be better water use in our homes so that less water reaches this area in poor conditions,” Santiago says.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

Before the overexploitation of the Colorado River, its delta crossed Baja California and Sonora until it met the waters of the Gulf of California, resulting in more than 400,000 hectares of wetlands. Although the river’s course has become a ghost, about 15 percent of those wetlands have survived, harboring an invaluable biodiversity of plants and animals. Seeking to mimic that strength, the Las Arenitas artificial wetland is a pause to the devastation of the local landscape.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Tesla brought in 20 percent less automotive revenue at the end of last year compared to the year previous, the company reported today, as demand for its electric cars appear to have dipped precipitously across the globe. The drop exceeded even some pessimistic Wall Street analysts’ predictions.\nBy late afternoon, before CEO Elon Musk and other company leaders appeared for a quarterly update call for investors, stock prices appeared relatively stable on the news. Overall, however, the electric automaker’s stock price is down more than 40 percent from its late-2024 high.\nIn a slide deck prepared for investors, Tesla pinned the drop on declines in deliveries, some which it said were related to the need to retool some of its production lines for modified versions of its best-selling electric cars.\nUnmentioned explicitly in the document were the controversies surrounding Musk and his involvement with the government of President Donald Trump. Musk, who has been called the “First Buddy” and regularly spends weekends with Trump in Florida, heads up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which is responsible for sweeping federal budget cuts that have affected everything from the data privacy of immigrants and groundbreaking disease research to federal disaster response and consumer financial protections. Musk’s involvement has led to a boycott of Tesla’s cars and mass protests across the US and Europe.\nOn a call with investors, Musk suggested, without evidence, that the protesters had nefarious motives. “The protests—they’re very organized, they’re paid for, they’re obviously not going to admit that the reason they’re protesting is that they receive fraudulent money and are the recipients of wasteful largesse. But that is the real reason for the protests,” he said.\nMusk said he would spend less time on DOGE starting in May, though he will continue to dedicate “a day or two per week” to the effort through the end of Trump’s term.\nOverall, the company’s revenue was down 9 percent compared to last year.\n“We’re not on the ragged edge of death, not even close,” Musk told investors, arguing the company has been in worse spots in the past.\nThe numbers put extra pressure on Tesla’s forthcoming self-driving service, set to launch in Austin, Texas, in June, and the Cybercab, a purpose-built robotaxi. Musk said on Tuesday that both are on track. “There will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,” he told investors on the earnings call. (Musk last promised that Tesla would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by 2020.) He said Tesla would have 10 million autonomous vehicles on roads in “a few years.”\nBeyond taxi services and Cybercab, Musk said Tesla owners in “several cities” should this year be able to operate their cars completely autonomously, so that “you go to sleep in your car and wake up in your destination.” He emphasized, though, that Tesla would focus on safety.\nMusk has argued that Tesla’s future is pinned on its success in self-driving and autonomous technology, which includes not only self-driving cars but also the company’s humanoid robot, Optimus. “The value of the company is primarily on the basis of autonomy. That's really, I think, the main driver of our value,\" Musk said in 2023. (He has expressed similar sentiments many times since.)\nEarlier this year, Musk told investors that Tesla would launch autonomous driving technology in Austin and California this year, with a robotaxi service launching in the Texas city in June. (The service is slated to launch with Model Y’s rather than Cybercabs.) Tesla has since obtained a permit to operate a driver-ed taxi service in California, though will need to apply for and win several more permits to operate that service without drivers behind the wheel. It has entered talks with the city of Palo Alto, where its engineering teams are headquartered, to eventually offer a ride service there, according to emails obtained via public records requested by WIRED. (Because of Texas’ less stringent regulations, the carmaker does not need extra permits or government sign-off to operate a driverless service in Austin.)\nThe success of Cybercab, which is set to go into production in 2026, is especially important because Tesla does not seem to have many other car projects on the horizon. A long-awaited, more affordable electric vehicle was downgraded last year to a modified but still cheaper version of Tesla’s popular Model Y rather than a whole new vehicle. Last week, Reuters reported that the more affordable vehicle had been delayed by at least several months.\nA robotaxi service puts Tesla into direct competition with Google sister company Waymo, which has been operating a paid, self-driving taxi service in metro Phoenix and in San Francisco for nearly two years. (Waymo also operates in Los Angeles and Austin and is set to launch in Atlanta and Miami in the coming months.) Amazon’s Zoox is also preparing to launch service in Las Vegas and, later, San Francisco.\nBoth Waymo and Zoox took more measured approaches to self-driving than Tesla, with years of testing with supervising drivers behind the wheel to monitor the technology. Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” feature is available on all of its US cars for an added fee, but the company warns that drivers must still pay attention to the road while using its tech. Still, the company has emphasized that it will leap from this less advanced, “level 2” autonomy to full-blown unsupervised driving.\nTechnology experts have cast doubt on Tesla’s ambitious timelines. Self-driving watchers should be mindful of the high levels of safety and reliability demanded by an autonomous vehicle service, says Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at MIT who leads the Advanced Vehicle Technology consortium, which brings together industry experts and academics to study how people interact with automated driving features. ”I think the world is wondering, can Tesla do this?” says Reimer. “And my answer is, yeah, they can do some demo, probably with a safety driver.”\nA Tesla robotaxi service will also need much work beyond even the complex technology required to make the cars go. “Until you actually pull the safety driver out, you don’t realize all the other things they were doing for you: answering questions for the passenger, helping them navigate the whole system, [navigating] the picking up and dropping off,” says Jeff Schneider, a robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who once worked for Uber’s self-driving-car project.\nIn a slide deck for investors, Tesla wrote that it expected to be affected by uncertainty related to “evolving trade policy,” which the company says will likely affect both Tesla’s global supply chain and what it spends to build its products. “This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,” the deck said.\nMusk told investors that Tesla was still the “least impacted” car company in terms of tariffs, because so much of the company’s vehicle stock is made and assembled in the US. “That puts us in a better position than many of our competitors,” he said. Musk said he would continue to speak with the president about tariff policy. “I will continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs, but that's all I can do,” he said.\nThis is a developing story.

    "content_text": "Affiliates from Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have significant access to 19 sensitive systems at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), according to a recent court filing. Nine of those are previously undisclosed.\nThis wide-ranging access, which includes a centralized accounting system for all Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) programs, the cloud for a “robust” and “high-volume data warehouse,” and several additional HHS accounting systems that pay government contractors, demonstrates the breadth of DOGE’s takeover at the federal agency charged with securing health care for millions of Americans.\nHHS submitted the filing as part of an ongoing lawsuit. The document—which is related to a motion for preliminary injunction—shows that a total of four DOGE affiliates now have access to the Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS), which pays out federal grants and is used for accounting by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A previous court filing claimed three DOGE operatives had access to HIGLAS, which could theoretically allow them to cut off Medicaid payments to states, according to NPR.\nHHS did not immediately respond to an official request for comment from WIRED.\nDOGE’s access to some of the databases in the new court filing were first revealed in a March court filing and reporting from NPR and The Guardian. However, the full scope has come into focus as a result of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations’s continued lawsuit attempting to restrict DOGE’s data access at HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. As part of the AFL-CIO’s motion, the plaintiffs allege the agencies have given DOGE “unfettered, on-demand access to their most sensitive systems of records” because the affiliates “invoke the incantation of ‘waste, fraud, and abuse.’” According to the plaintiffs, “‘waste, fraud, and abuse’ are not magic words, and they cannot conjure up a need to grant DOGE Team members on-demand access to Americans’ most sensitive and personal information.”\nAs part of the discovery process, federal agencies have been required to disclose which databases DOGE has accessed, which were attached to the plaintiffs' recent motion.\nJeffrey Levi, an emeritus professor of health policy and management at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health, tells WIRED that “anything that has the potential of delaying payments to parts of the health system” runs the risk of disrupting care for the millions of Americans that rely on it. Levi notes that places with “minimal financial flexibility”—like rural hospitals and Federally Qualified Health Centers, which disproportionately serve people who use Medicaid and Medicare—are particularly vulnerable.\nThe filing lists known DOGE affiliates, including Luke Farritor, Marko Elez, Edward Coristine, Rachel Riley, Aram Moghaddassi, Zachary Terrell, and Kyle Schutt, among those who have access to HHS systems. Coristine, who has gone by the name “Big Balls” online, previously worked for a company that employed convicted and reformed hackers, WIRED reported.\nElez, a young engineer who has worked at Musk’s X and SpaceX, has also appeared at the Department of Labor, the Social Security Administration, and the Department of the Treasury. While at the Treasury, WIRED reported, Elez had both read and write access to sensitive payments systems. In early February, Elez briefly resigned from DOGE after racist comments posted by an account he was linked to were discovered by The Wall Street Journal, though Elez returned to DOGE after Musk and Vice President JD Vance posted in defense of him on X.\nThe court filing raises legal and ethical questions around how personal information is currently being treated in the federal government, says Elizabeth Laird, the Center for Democracy and Technology’s director of Equity in Civic Technology.\n“It just underscores why for so long we have had protections that have really centered someone's right to privacy and [required] consent for sharing that level of sensitivity of information about them,” Laird says. “Just in this agency, with this level of sensitivity, that's a right that's been stripped away from every person who is included in there.”\nBelow is a chart that details DOGE’s access to HHS, complete with the names of the agencies impacted, the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contained in those agencies, and the DOGE operatives who have, or had, access.

The rest is recreated from the court filing.\nDOGE affiliates were given access to HHS systems as a result of three executive orders signed by President Donald Trump, according to an April 8 deposition by Jennifer Wendel, chief information officer at HHS, who is stepping down this spring. The first was the January 20 order that established DOGE’s existence. The second was a February order on implementing the DOGE agenda, and the third was an order to eliminate waste, fraud, abuse and data silos.\nThe orders—and in particular the mandate to root out fraud—gave DOGE wide-ranging access to government systems. The team was required to speak with system owners before accessing certain tools, according to Wendel. In theory, the owner could deny access if they felt that DOGE access was not justified. In practice, Wendel said, access at HHS has never been denied.\nThat appears to have been the case even though one DOGE affiliate failed to receive the proper security training needed to access a particularly sensitive system.\nBefore someone is allowed to access the Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System and the Integrated Data Repository (IDR), they’re required to go through a security training, according to the April 8 deposition by Wendel and another that occurred on the same day by Garey Rice, the principal deputy assistant secretary for operations at HHS. The depositions come as part of the AFL-CIO lawsuit.\nDuring the depositions, an attorney for the plaintiffs tried to ascertain whether DOGE affiliate Aram Moghaddassi had been through the proper training to access the HIGLAS and IDR systems. In a previous government filing, Moghaddassi was not listed as having read-only access to any of the HHS systems, including HIGLAS, despite court records indicating he was detailed to the agency in early March. Rice confirmed that there was no record of Moghaddassi completing the required security briefing.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at MattGiles45.42.\nAttorneys for the labor groups tried to figure out why DOGE affiliates Elez and Moghaddassi had access to, for example, the national directory of new hires, a system that tracks child support payments and which includes sensitive information like social security numbers, mailing address, and employment status. “In order to determine if there was potential waste, fraud, and abuse within the system,” Wendel responded. “What kind of fraud, waste and abuse did HHS think might be in the system?” the attorney probed. “I do not know,” Wendel responded.\nWendel testified that she did not believe DOGE operatives had not shown people outside of HHS the records they had access to. However, asked whether the team could take their laptops home and access HHS records remotely, Wendel said yes. “Do you know if the DOGE team affiliates have literally just shown someone, outside HHS, HHS records?” the attorney asked. “I do not know that,” Wendel responded.\nAccording to the filing, Elez and Moghaddassi previously had access to the “Expanded Federal Parent Locator Service,” a service that notifies relatives when a child has been placed in foster care, but they have since been “deactivated,” meaning their access has been revoked.\nSome of these systems were not actively in use by agencies at HHS. “We don’t use [Integrated Contracts Expert] anymore. APEX replaced that in October,” an employee at HHS tells WIRED. APEX, or Acquisition Performance and Execution, which Farritor also has access to, is the CDC’s contract-writing and acquisition-management system. “APEX has everything,” the employee says. “So many details. Amounts paid, approvals, history, contact info, and more.”\nThe filing affirms previous reports that DOGE affiliate Kyle Schutt has access to a database with health records about children who come into the US unaccompanied. Laird tells WIRED that access to this data—which includes biometrics, medical notes, photographs, and information about their sponsors—is particularly concerning.\n“What's the reason—if you're looking for fraud, waste, and abuse—to have data about children who are present in the US without their family?” Laird says. “We're increasingly seeing this type of information being used for purposes other than fraud, waste, and abuse, like immigration enforcement.”\nAs reported by WIRED, DOGE operatives are building a master database at the Department of Homeland Security that includes voting records from Pennsylvania and Florida, Social Security Administration data, and Internal Revenue Service data that has the potential to identify and surveil immigrants at a massive scale.\nWIRED also reported that DOGE operatives at the Department of Labor have been given access to databases that house the personal information of migrant farm workers, including applicants for temporary work visas. They also had access to information that could be combined with other datasets in order to determine the immigration status of people benefitting from certain federal programs.\nFederal officials and labor leaders have also raised concerns about DOGE’s potential to access unredacted DOL files that would identify corporate whistleblowers, and detailed information about safety inspections at private companies.\nThe most recent court filing that discloses DOGE’s data access at the DOL is from March 29. It claims Elez had access to four record systems at the DOL and had “not accessed any of the systems,” but had installed Python and a tool for editing software code. The systems included databases that manage federal employees’ access to government buildings and systems, and a database that tracks unemployment benefit claims.\nEarlier this month, thousands of employees at HHS agencies, including doctors and scientists at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were purged from the agency as DOGE continues to drastically slash the size of the federal workforce. The cuts also hit some administrative employees at HHS who manage critical cybersecurity infrastructure and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of federal contracts.",

    "content_text": "Whisky, a gaming-focused front end for Wine’s Windows-compatibility tools on macOS, is no longer receiving updates. As one of the most useful and well-regarded tools in a Mac gamer's toolkit, it could be seen as a great loss, but its developer hopes you'll move on with what he considers a better option: supporting CodeWeavers' CrossOver product.\nAlso, Whisky's creator is an 18-year-old college student, and he could use a break.\n\"I am 18, yes, and attending Northeastern University, so it's always a balancing act between my school work and dev work,\" Isaac Marovitz wrote to Ars Technica. The Whisky project has \"been more or less in this state for a few months, I posted the notice mostly to clarify and formally announce it,\" Marovitz says, having received \"a lot of questions\" about the project status.\nContributing “Practically Zero”\nMarovitz is no slacker, having previously worked on the Switch emulator Ryujinx, which shut down after an agreement with Nintendo, and other gaming projects, including PlayCover. So while a break is a good thing, there is another big reason: \"Whisky, in my opinion, has not been a positive on the Wine community as a whole,\" Marovitz wrote on the Whisky site.\nHe advised that Whisky users buy a CrossOver license, and noted that while CodeWeavers and Valve's work on Proton have had a big impact on the Wine project, “the amount that Whisky as a whole contributes to Wine is practically zero.” Fixes for Wine running Mac games “have to come from people who are not only incredibly knowledgeable on C, Wine, Windows, but also macOS,” Marovitz wrote, and “the pool of developers with those skills is very limited.”\nWhile Marovitz tells Ars that he's had “some contact with CodeWeavers” in making Whisky, “they were always curious and never told me what I should or should not do.” It became clear to him, though, “from what [CodeWeavers] could tell me as well as observing the attitude of the wider community that Whisky could seriously threaten CrossOver's viability.”\nThe center of Whisky's homepage now carries a persistent notice that “Whisky is no longer actively maintained. Apps and games may break at any time.”\nA Tipped-Cap Moment\nCodeWeavers' CEO wrote on the company's blog late last week about the Whisky shutdown, topped with an image of a glass of the spirit clinking against a glass of wine. “Whisky may have been a CrossOver competitor, but that's not how we feel today,” wrote James B. Ramey. “Our response is simply one of empathy, understanding, and acknowledgement for Isaac's situation.”\nRamey noted that Whisky was a free packaging of an open source project, crafted by someone who, like CrossOver, did it as “a labor of love built by people who care deeply about giving users more choices.” But Marovitz faced \"an avalanche of user expectations,\" Ramey wrote, regarding game compatibility, performance, and features. “The reality is that testing, support, and development take real resources … If CodeWeavers were not viable because of CrossOver not being sustainable, it would likely dampen the future development of WINE and Proton and support for macOS gaming,” Ramey wrote.\n“We ‘tip our cap’ to Isaac and the impact he made to macOS gaming,” Ramey wrote, strangely choosing that colloquial salute instead of the more obvious beverage analogy for the two projects.\nMarovitz tells Ars that while user expectations were “definitely an issue,” they were not the major reason for ceasing development. “I've worked on other big projects before and during Whisky's development, so I'm not a stranger to tuning out the noise of constant user expectations.”\nOpen source projects shutting down because of the tremendous pressure they put on their unpaid coders is a kind of “dog bites man” story in the coding world. It's something else entirely when a prolific coder sees a larger ecosystem as not really benefiting from their otherwise very neat tool, and chooses deference. Still, during its run, the Whisky app drew attention to Mac gaming and the possibilities of Wine, and by extension Apple's own Game Porting Toolkit, itself based on CrossOver.

    "content_text": "Pump.Fun, the world’s largest memecoin factory, has made it possible for anybody to create their own cryptocurrency. But years before the platform launched, an individual going by the same name as one of its cofounders, Dylan Kerler, was already making a small fortune hawking—then dumping—home-baked coins.\nA WIRED investigation identified eight coins launched by an individual using the name Dylan Kerler in 2017. At that point, the Dylan Kerler who cofounded Pump.Fun was 16 years old. Two of the coins—eBitcoinCash and EthereumCash—gained traction on a crypto forum before tumbling in price, leading investors to allege that the developer had performed a rug pull, an ethically dubious maneuver whereby somebody hypes up their coin and then sinks the price by selling off their holdings.\nThrough sales of eBitcoinCash and EthereumCash, the developer going by Dylan Kerler earned as much as $75,000 worth of cryptocurrency at 2017 prices, an analysis conducted by crypto security firm CertiK indicates. (Today, that same pile of crypto would be worth around $400,000.)\n“After waiting for the market share and price to rise, they quickly cashed out and exited,” says Tielei Wang, chief security officer at CertiK. “We strongly suspect that [EthereumCash] was used by the developer for a rug pull.”\nPump.Fun’s raison d'être is to protect investors from unscrupulous actors by standardizing the way coins are issued, its cofounders have said. But evidence suggests that the individual going by Dylan Kerler previously indulged in the very rug-pulling activities the platform is supposed to prevent.\nPump.Fun and Dylan Kerler did not respond to several requests for comment.\nPump.Fun was created in January 2024 by three entrepreneurs in their early twenties: Noah Tweedale, Alon Cohen, and Dylan Kerler. The platform has since become the go-to venue for launching and trading memecoins, a highly volatile type of crypto coin typically created for the sole purpose of financial speculation. In only 15 months, Pump.Fun has raked in over $600 million in revenue as a 1 percent cut of trades, third-party calculations show.\nThe three cofounders have each tried to reveal as little as possible about their identities, whereabouts, and the operation’s corporate structure. That secrecy stems partly from a concern about “personal security and safety,” Tweedale told WIRED in an interview last year, acting as a shield against any would-be extortionists attracted by the crypto wealth passing through Pump.Fun coffers.\nOf the trio, perhaps the least is known about Kerler, who has barely any public association with Pump.Fun beyond documentation filed with Companies House, the UK companies register, where he is listed as a director. His role is to lead the team of developers who code the platform and develop new features, Tweedale told WIRED. Aside from an X account under the alias @outdoteth, Kerler has barely any online footprint.\nHowever, digital breadcrumbs deposited across GitHub, YouTube, LinkedIn, Medium, and other corners of the web tie the name to the alleged eBitcoinCash and EthereumCash rug pulls.\nIn 2017, both coins were first marketed on crypto forum BitcoinTalk by two accounts belonging to the same individual: DOMAINBROKER and ninjagod. After the former account was allegedly “hacked,” its owner began to use the ninjagod profile to communicate with investors instead, according to a forum message.\nIn a BitcoinTalk thread promoting eBitcoinCash, DOMAINBROKER provided an email address that contains Dylan Kerler’s name, describing it as their “personal email.” In a separate thread for EthereumCash, started by ninjagod, other forum users referred to “Dylan Kerler” as the coin’s developer.\nMeanwhile, several indicators place Dylan Kerler, the Pump.Fun cofounder, in the same geographical location as the eBitcoinCash and EthereumCash developer, who in an old Telegram group stated that they were based in Brighton, England.\nElectoral records reviewed by WIRED indicate that Kerler was registered to vote at a property in Brighton and Hove, England, as recently as 2024. When WIRED visited the property on April 15, an individual speaking over the intercom declined to answer questions or identify themselves but said that Kerler “doesn’t live here anymore,” thereby confirming the accuracy of the electoral records.\nCorporate filings show that a Pump.Fun entity was previously registered to the same Brighton and Hove property. The address is shared with two other companies, both of which list 62-year-old Kee Fatt Phoon as a director. Phoon is registered to vote at that address as well.\nOccasionally, Dylan Kerler seems to have also gone by Dylan Phoon, an alternative moniker that appears to be derived from the surname of Kee Fatt Phoon, implying the two are related. Until recently, an account on development platform GitHub that uses Kerler’s outdoteth alias contained an old code repository that included a contact Gmail address for Dylan Phoon. The profile picture for the Gmail account is used across a Medium profile with the username DylanKerler1, as well as LinkedIn and YouTube accounts under Dylan Phoon.\nThe listings for the YouTube account contain a video about a cryptocurrency called Skycoin. Though Skycoin was launched by somebody else entirely, the project’s emblem is featured on the ninjagod BitcoinTalk account—a loose indicator that the accounts are owned by the same person.\nA second YouTube account, @dylankerler4130, features a video about a coin called Equis, marketed as a project that was “REVOLUTIONISING GAMBLING.” Equis was also promoted by ninjagod on BitcoinTalk and is made up of identical code to both eBitcoinCash and EthereumCash. (Equis failed to gain any traction among prospective investors on BitcoinTalk.)\nIn this way, both of the names used by the Pump.Fun cofounder—Dylan Kerler and Dylan Phoon—are tied back to the BitcoinTalk accounts through which EthereumCash and eBitcoinCash were promoted.\neBitcoinCash and Ethereum Cash were launched by the developer operating under the name Dylan Kerler at the height of the ICO boom, during which hundreds of coins raised billions of dollars from investors. An ICO, or initial coin offering, is a type of fundraising mechanism that became popular among crypto startups in part because it did not involve giving away equity.\nPerforming an ICO generally involves deploying code to mint a coin on the Ethereum network, outlining the ambitions for a project on a website, and soliciting investment. “Many projects were little more than a white paper and a landing page with a countdown timer—the barrier to entry was minimal,” says Wang.\nThough a handful of crypto projects that raised funds by ICO remain in operation—including Ethereum itself—the boom was largely characterized by grift and chicanery, analysts say, before financial regulators eventually cracked down on the practice. Frequently, developers misrepresented the utility and capabilities of their projects, manipulated the price of coins to generate hype, and wildly overstated the profits available to investors, analysts claim.\nDevelopers “were trying to really push the idea of getting crazy returns,” says Nicolai Søndergaard, research analyst at blockchain analytics company Nansen, adding, “That’s where the FOMO really comes in.”\nThe clamor around ICOs led credulous investors to conduct little due diligence in their eagerness to profit, in a similar way to traders who today race into dubious memecoins. “There are a lot of parallels between the meme frenzy and ICOs,” says Søndergaard. “It’s quite easy to sell an idea for the masses, then rug it.”\nThe developer going by the name Dylan Kerler began to promote EthereumCash, their most popular coin, in early October 2017.\nThe developer followed largely the same playbook as their previous launches: They minted the coin on Ethereum, created a website, and marketed on BitcoinTalk, Twitter, and Telegram. To create a swell of enthusiasm, they handed out bundles of the coin for free in what’s called an airdrop. Then they promised to publish a white paper, which at that time was considered a signal of legitimacy likely to propel the price upward.\n“You want to push a white paper. That’s what gets people interested,” says Søndergaard. “Sometimes, just the promise of a white paper was enough.”\nScreenshots of the now-deleted website posted on Telegram reveal how the coin was presented to prospective investors. “We aim to make the transition from fiat currency to cryptocurrency as easily as possible whilst still maintaining an heir [sic] of integrity an [sic] sophistication,” the website stated. Underneath, the page featured an image of a bank card that would purportedly allow holders to spend EthereumCash in stores.\nWithin a few days, hundreds of people signed up for the EthereumCash airdrop, a spreadsheet obtained by WIRED shows. Meanwhile, the BitcoinTalk thread was abuzz with conversation. “Let [sic] spread the word and get people to notice this great token,” wrote one forum user. By October 19, EthereumCash had risen in value to around $1.3 million.\nHowever, as early investors celebrated, behind the scenes the developer going by Dylan Kerler was beginning to sell.\nIn the days after creating EthereumCash, the developer delivered millions of units to a variety of crypto wallets under their control. One of those crypto wallets, whose alphanumeric identifier begins in 0x7f3E2, was then used to sell large quantities into the market, a CertiK analysis shows.\nBetween October 19 and 21, 0x7f3E2 sold hundreds of batches of EthereumCash on EtherDelta, a peer-to-peer exchange. The sales coincided with a catastrophic fall in the price of the asset, which sank by 87.9 percent.\nOn Telegram and BitcoinTalk, panic began to spread. One user, presumably trying to find the funny side, took to calling the coin “ECRASH.” Others alleged that the developer was responsible. “Folks were pissed,” another Telegram user, who participated in the EthereumCash airdrop, recounted to WIRED. “I think it may have been my first rug pull.”\nThe much-anticipated white paper never materialized, and ultimately the developer going by Dylan Kerler disappeared from the BitcoinTalk thread and Telegram group. Only days earlier, they had promised investors that big things were to come: “I can assure you that the project is making headlong progress,” they wrote.\nIn three transactions across October 20 and 21, the wallet belonging to the developer withdrew proceeds from EtherDelta totalling 240 ETH, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, back then worth around $75,000. After each withdrawal, the ETH was immediately swept into another wallet—0xc8ae1—then further divided between three more: 0x7EAbb, 0x31728, and 0x952F3. From there, the ETH was sent to accounts with Binance, Bity, and the now-defunct Cryptopia, centralized exchanges typically used to convert crypto into regular currency.\nIn all, WIRED identified at least 20 wallets used by the developer going by Dylan Kerler to either issue, airdrop, or sell eBitcoinCash and EthereumCash—or to move the revenue through a centralized exchange.\nThe effect of this layering process is to obfuscate the movement of funds, says Søndergaard. “If you have nothing to hide, there’s not a huge reason” for it. “It is suspicious.”\nThough some investors continued to hope that Dylan Kerler would return—“I can smell the white paper,\" joked one person on October 24, days after the price had collapsed—the eventual outcome would have been easily predicted by anybody paying close enough attention.\n“It is going to be like a pump and dump where early investors make their money back,” the developer going by Dylan Kerler had written in the BitcoinTalk thread for eBitcoinCash in early October, in a startling display of candor. “Sorry for being brutally honest but it's the truth.”\nIn the present day, the madcap rise of Pump.Fun continues; the platform is generating revenue at a rate of roughly $1 million a day, according to third-party calculations. As the founders’ crypto fortune swells—dwarfing the revenue from eBitcoinCash and EthereumCash many times over—rug pulls continue on the platform practically unchecked.\n“Holy fuck! Holy fuck!” shouted one teenager last November, livestreaming on Pump.Fun as he dumped a coin he had created minutes earlier, netting himself $30,000. Then he flipped two middle fingers to the screen.",

    "content_text": "In the Roman Catholic Church, it was called the “Francis effect,” a feeling that the arrival of the more inclusive Pope Francis in 2013 would invigorate the faith and get people back in the pews.\nOn Monday, Francis’ passing at the age of 88 led to an effect of a different kind: a surge in viewership for Conclave, director Edward Berger’s Oscar-winning film about what happens in the Vatican when church leaders are locked in a room—or, well, the Sistine Chapel—to decide who will be the next pope.\nStreaming viewership for Conclave increased 283 percent after Pope Francis’ death, jumping from 1.8 million minutes watched on April 20 to 6.9 million minutes watched on Monday, according to data from analytics firm Luminate. Netflix’s The Two Popes, meanwhile, saw a 417 percent increase in viewership over that same period, jumping from 290,000 minutes to 1.5 million minutes.\nIn some ways, these numbers are to be expected. Conclave’s arrival last year and eight Oscar nominations (it won for Best Adapted Screenplay) had already made it a popular film. The fact that the Vatican is about to start a real-life conclave in just a few days only increases the attention on the film. The Two Popes, meanwhile, is about Pope Francis himself, and the relationship he had with his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.\nWhile the numbers are impressive, Luminate has seen similar boosts after other significant news events, according to spokesperson Jimmy Harney. When presidential candidate Donald Trump announced JD Vance as his running mate during the Republican National Convention last year, viewership for Netflix’s Hillbilly Elegy, based on Vance’s memoir, jumped 1,180 percent, according to Luminate. When news came out that Vice President Kamala Harris would likely be the Democrats’ candidate for president, US viewership for HBO’s Veep increased 353 percent.\nTheoretically, Conclave’s viewership numbers could climb even higher in the coming days. On Monday, thanks to one of the many cumbersome deals that dictate the modern streaming landscape, viewers needed to rent or buy the movie in order to watch it. It cost between $6 and $20 on Amazon Prime Video. Early Tuesday, the movie became available to stream for Prime members.\nFollowing Pope Francis’ death—an announcement that sent Catholics around the world into mourning—several news outlets (including this one) pointed to Conclave’s timeliness. The film, about a series of high-profile cardinals and their efforts to become the next pontiff, is a highly dramatized, and drama-filled, version of what the secretive conclave process looks like.\nFrancis’ funeral will be held in front of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome on Saturday. Cardinals from around the world are headed to Italy to attend. After which, they will take part in the conclave, a name that’s derived from the Latin “with key,” meaning they will be locked in the historic church while they deliberate. No outside contact is permitted during the process; no phones, televisions, newspapers, or messages are allowed. Members of the College of Cardinals, the church’s most senior clergy, under the age of 80 get a vote, so about 135 of the 250-member body will be involved in the choosing.\nAccording to Luminate data, other pope-centric films like Netflix’s Pope Francis biographic series Call Me Francis, haven’t seen the same huge spikes—yet. Maybe viewers just need to get back in the habit of watching Catholic content.",

    "content_text": "My earliest memory of 4chan was sitting up late at night, typing its URL into my browser, and scrolling through a thread of LOLcat memes, which were brand-new at the time.\nBack then a photoshop of a cat saying \"I can has cheezburger\" or an image of an owl saying “ORLY?” was, without question, the funniest thing my 14-year-old brain had ever laid eyes on. So much so, I woke my dad up by laughing too hard and had to tell him that I was scrolling through pictures of cats at 2 in the morning. Later, I would become intimately familiar with the site’s much more nefarious tendencies.\nIt's strange to look back at 4chan, apparently wiped off the internet entirely last week by hackers from a rival message board—and seemingly restored a week and a half later—and think about how many different websites it was over its more than two decades online. What began as a hub for internet culture and an anonymous way station for the internet's anarchic true believers devolved over the years into a fan club for mass shooters, the central node of Gamergate, and the beating heart of far-right fascism around the world—a virus that infected every facet of our lives, from the slang we use to the politicians we vote for. But the site itself had been frozen in amber since the George W. Bush administration.\nIt is likely that there will never be a site like 4chan again—which is, likely, a very good thing. But it had also essentially already succeeded at its core project: chewing up the world and spitting it back out in its own image. Everything—from X to Facebook to YouTube—now sort of feels like 4chan. Which makes you wonder why it even needed to still exist.\n\"The novelty of a website devoted to shock and gore, and the rebelliousness inherent in it, dies when your opinions become the official policy of the world's five or so richest people and the government of the United States,\" the Onion CEO and former extremism reporter Ben Collins tells WIRED. “Like any ostensibly nihilist cultural phenomenon, it inherently dies if that phenomenon itself becomes The Man.”\nMy first experience with the more toxic side of the site came several years after my LOLcat all-nighter, when I was in college. I was a big Tumblr user—all my friends were on there—and for about a year or so, our corner of the platform felt like an extension of the house parties we would throw. That cozy vibe came crashing down for me when I got doxed the summer going into my senior year. Someone made a “hate blog” for me—one of the first times I felt the dark presence of an anonymous stranger’s digital ire, and posted my phone number on 4chan.\nThey played a prank that was popular on the site at the time, writing in a thread that my phone number was for a GameStop store that had a copy of the ultra-rare video game Battletoads. I received no less than 250 phone calls over the next 48 hours asking if I had a copy of the game.\nMany of the 4chan users that called me mid-Battletoad attack left messages. I listened to all of them. A pattern quickly emerged: young men, clearly nervous to even leave a message, trying to harass a stranger for, seemingly, the hell of it. Those voicemails have never left me in the 15 years I've spent covering 4chan as a journalist.\nI had a front-row seat to the way those timid men morphed into the violent, seething underbelly of the internet. The throbbing engine of reactionary hatred that resented everything and everyone simply because resentment was the only language its users knew how to speak. I traveled the world in the 2010s, tracing 4chan’s impact on global democracy. I followed it to France, Germany, Japan, and Brazil as 4chan's users became increasingly convinced that they could take over the planet through racist memes, far-right populism, and cyberbullying. And, in a way, they did. But the ubiquity of 4chan culture ended up being an oddly Pyrrhic victory for the site itself.\nCollins, like me, closely followed 4chan's rise in the 2010s from internet backwater to unofficial propaganda organ of the Trump administration. As he sees it, once Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 there was really no point to 4chan anymore. Why hide behind anonymity if a billionaire lets you post the same kind of extremist content under your real name and even pays you for it?\n4chan’s “user base just moved into a bigger ballpark and started immediately impacting American life and policy,\" Collins says. \"Twitter became 4chan, then the 4chanified Twitter became the United States government. Its usefulness as an ammo dump in the culture war was diminished when they were saying things you would now hear every day on Twitter, then six months later out of the mouths of an administration official.\"\nBut understanding how 4chan went from the home of cat memes to a true internet bogeyman requires an understanding of how the site actually worked. Its features were often overlooked amid all the conversations about the site's political influence, but I'd argue they were equally, if not more, important.\n4chan was founded by Christopher “Moot” Poole when he was 15. A regular user on slightly less anarchic comedy site Something Awful, Poole created a spinoff site for a message board there called “Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse.” Poole was a fan of the Japanese message board 2chan, or Futaba Channel, and wanted to give Western anime fans their own version, so he poorly translated the site's code and promoted his new site, 4chan, to Something Awful's anime community. Several core features were ported over in the process.\n4chan users were anonymous, threads weren't permanent and would time out or \"404\" after a period of inactivity, and there were dozens of sub-boards you could post to. That unique combination of ephemerality, anonymity, and organized chaos proved to be a potent mix, immediately creating a race-to-the-bottom gutter culture unlike anything else on the web. The dark end point of the techno-utopianism that built the internet. On 4chan you were no one, and nothing you did mattered unless it was so shocking, so repulsive, so hateful that someone else noticed and decided to screenshot it before it disappeared into the digital ether.\n\"The iconic memes that came out of 4chan are because people took the time to save it, you know? And the fact that nobody predicted, nobody could predict or control what was saved or what wasn't saved, I think, is really, really fascinating,\" Cates Holderness, Tumblr's former head of editorial, tells WIRED.\nStill, 4chan was more complicated than it looked from the outside. The site was organized into dozens of smaller sections, everything from comics to cooking to video games to, of course, pornography. Holderness says she learned to make bread during the pandemic thanks to 4chan's cooking board. (Full disclosure: I introduced Holderness to 4chan way back in 2012.)\n\"When I switched to sourdough, I got really good pointers,\" she says.\nHolderness calls 4chan the internet's “Wild West” and says its demise this month felt appropriate in a way. The chaos that defined 4chan, both the good and the very, very bad, has largely been paved over by corporate platforms and their algorithms now.\nOur feeds deliver us content; we don't have to hunt for it. We don't have to sit in front of a computer refreshing a page to find out whether we're getting a new cat meme or a new manifesto. The humanness of that era of the web, now that 4chan is gone, is likely never coming back. And we'll eventually find out if that's a good thing or a bad thing.\n\"The snippets that we have of what 4chan was—it's all skewed,” Holderness says. “There is no record. There's no record that can ever encapsulate what 4chan was.\"\nUpdated: 4/28/2025, 10:30 AM EDT: This article has been updated to reflect that 4chan appears to have come back online, according to a blog posted on the site on April 25.",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\">Many of the 4chan users that called me mid-<em>Battletoad</em> attack left messages. I listened to all of them. A pattern quickly emerged: young men, clearly nervous to even leave a message, trying to harass a stranger for, seemingly, the hell of it. Those voicemails have never left me in the 15 years I've spent covering 4chan as a journalist.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I had a front-row seat to the way those timid men morphed into the violent, seething underbelly of the internet. The throbbing engine of reactionary hatred that resented everything and everyone simply because resentment was the only language its users knew how to speak. I traveled the world in the 2010s, tracing 4chan’s impact on global democracy. I followed it to France, Germany, Japan, and Brazil as 4chan's users became increasingly convinced that they could take over the planet through racist memes, far-right populism, and cyberbullying. And, in a way, they did. But the ubiquity of 4chan culture ended up being an oddly Pyrrhic victory for the site itself.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Collins, like me, closely followed 4chan's rise in the 2010s from internet backwater to unofficial propaganda organ of the Trump administration. As he sees it, once Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 there was really no point to 4chan anymore.

Subscribe Today.\nKoyaanisqatsi (1982)\nTo call Koyaanisqatsi a nature documentary might feel like a stretch, but no other nonfiction film presents a more clear-eyed critique of the relationship between human beings, the systems we've created, and the environment that sustains us. The title is a Hopi word that translates to “life in chaos,” and it pretty much tells you what's inside: long, gorgeous shots of the natural world juxtaposed with fast, hypnotic shots of humans going about their daily grind. We see people commuting through city centers, factory workers assembling cars, suburban moms grocery shopping, heavy machines mining minerals, and fighter planes blowing stuff up. Things accelerate into time-lapse and crawl into slow motion. All of this is accompanied by a throbbing, repetitive, and mind-blanking score by Philip Glass that's heavy on brass, synthesizers, and basso profundo chanting. Maybe most notable is the fact that Koyaanisqatsi came out in 1982, and yet its unspoken observations about how we exploit the environment in the name of commerce and progress are even more prescient today. —Michael Calore\nBaraka (1992)\nThis film could be considered a spiritual sequel to Koyaanisqatsi. Baraka's director, Ron Fricke, was the cinematographer on Koyaanisqatsi, and both films use a similar construct—lots of slow motion and time-lapse shots of life on Earth, a nonnarrative structure free of dialog, and a memorable score—to comment on the balance between humans, nature, and the world economy. It's a grim film at times, showing stark footage of industrial rampage and how society's most vulnerable citizens struggle, and often fail, to meet their basic needs. But curiously, it's also uplifting when taken as a whole. The film visits dozens of sacred cultural and spiritual sites around the world, showing songs, dances, and religious ceremonies that will surely contain some new experiences for almost everyone who watches. There are dazzling shots of locations and animals that I've never seen in any other documentary. Baraka is a crash course in the world's cultural and ecological diversity that will give you a sense of just how vast our planet is, and just how small it can feel. —Michael Calore\nMarch of the Penguins (2005)\nMarch of the Penguins casts emperor penguins as romantic monogamists (they’re not), devoted parents (kind of), and conquerors of a frozen hellscape (definitely). The truth is colder than the Antarctic tundra. Survival here is brutal and beautiful. Shot over a year around the French base of Dumont d’Urville in Adélie Land, the blockbuster film follows thousands of penguins on their annual migration to breed, where parents tag-team a death-defying relay of egg warming and food foraging. Never has waddling looked so noble. Did I mention it's narrated by Morgan Freeman?\nGrizzly Man (2005)\nGrizzly Man is not so much a wildlife documentary as it is a tragic love story between humanity and the wilderness. Timothy Treadwell, an amateur environmentalist, spent 13 summers filming himself among Alaskan grizzly bears, naming them, petting them, sometimes hand-feeding them, until one of them killed him and his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, in 2003. Werner Herzog stitches together Treadwell’s 100-plus hours of footage with his sobering narration. Treadwell believed the wild could love him back; Herzog sees only how small we are in its jaws.\nPlanet Earth I-III (2006-2023)\nIt feels like everyone has seen Planet Earth, but we’d be remiss not to include this TV series in our list of favorites. I rewatch it every year. From its inception in 2006, when it was a big deal that it was shot in high definition, to the use of drones and deep-sea submersibles while filming Planet Earth III in 2023, Planet Earth has stunning and intimate footage and, of course, the iconic narrator Sir David Attenborough.\nMy favorite episode is Planet Earth II, episode 6, “Cities,” which details the complex relationship between humans and wildlife. Did you know that light pollution from cities is messing with the hatching process of baby sea turtles, which have evolved to go toward moonlight? Did you also know that urban langurs are thriving because of the food available in cities? The complexities and frank look at how the human animal behaves with its planet-sharing brethren are the perfect framework that’ll make you think twice about who—and what—you are.\nAttenborough spends the whole series pleading with us to do something, as he has been for 70 years. But there are moments of joy as well, like the deep look at the courtship dances of birds in New Guinea. Every episode has various vignettes that follow different species around, offering, in many cases, a glimpse into their lives that we hadn’t previously seen. This series is a comfort show as much as it is a call to action, and I think everyone should watch it. Multiple times. (Spoiler alert: The turtles were rescued.) —Louryn Strampe\nKedi (2016)\nIn short, Kedi is a documentary about the street cats of Istanbul, Turkey. Ceyda Torun follows these whiskered wanderers through alleys and seedy piers, capturing their daily rituals, as well as the humans who feed, worry about, and philosophize over them. Kedi poses some of life’s big questions—about what it means to share space with beings we don’t control—while still delivering adorable kitty content in just 80 minutes.\nJane (2017)\nDirector Brett Morgen resurrects a trove of 16-mm footage shot by Jane Goodall’s first husband (and National Geographic photographer) Hugo van Lawick, and splices it into one of the most intimate nature documentaries of all time. Scored by Philip Glass and intercut with contemporary interviews of Goodall, Jane feels like a portal that drops you into her early years, studying chimpanzees in Tanzania’s Gombe Stream National Park. Young Jane radiates an infectious passion that feels like it could change the planet.\nBlue Planet II (2017)\nIt’s hard to overstate the cultural impact of BBC’s Blue Planet II. The follow-up to the 2001 series (The Blue Planet) showcases the deep sea in revolutionary detail. Bioluminescent squid, baby sea turtles, and coral reefs. Sea otters, orca whales, and the cutest puffins you’ve ever seen. After the final episode (“Our Blue Planet”) aired, the documentary series sparked an international reckoning with marine plastic pollution. In fact, a Waitrose-commissioned survey found that 9 out of 10 respondents had cut back on single-use plastics. Even Julian Hector, former head of the BBC Studios Natural History Unit, called it the most influential Attenborough program in terms of conservation awareness.\nHoneyland (2019)\nShot over three years and distilled from 400-plus hours of footage, Honeyland is a haunting reminder of what happens when you take more than nature can give. It follows Hatidže Muratova, a lone beekeeper in the remote hills of North Macedonia, who lives with her bedridden mother while she tends to her wild bees. She sells honey in the city, dyes her hair golden, and respects our ecosystem's equilibrium. When a livestock-toting family barrels in next door, it's a slow, sticky unraveling. What begins as a character study morphs into an allegory of human greed and climate change. You will scream. You will cry. You might even start beekeeping.\nMy Octopus Teacher (2020)\nA man befriends a wild octopus. That's the premise of My Octopus Teacher, and somehow, it will wreck you. In this Oscar-winning documentary, filmmaker Craig Foster free-dives daily in a South African kelp forest to follow a single cephalopod over a year. But the octopus isn’t necessarily the subject of this nature film; she becomes a teacher, a mirror, and a lesson on resilience and the circle of life. With stunning underwater visuals and existential overtones, My Octopus Teacher is less about marine life and more about what it means to live.\nFire of Love (2022)\nKatia and Maurice Krafft loved volcanoes so much, they ultimately died for them (spoiler alert?). Fire of Love tells the French volcanologists' story. They chased close-up eruptions with a mix of scientific obsession and poetic fatalism, as shown in a montage of archival footage narrated by Miranda July. “Before every volcanic eruption, the volcano gets the shivers, like a sick person,” Maurice says at one point. “The Earth shakes due to the rising magma. It also swells, like an abscess is forming. The slopes get steeper, the craters grow bigger. And the breath of the volcano changes, too. It turns foul. The composition of the volcanic gases changes, and its temperature rises, as though it had a fever.” For a beautiful double-header, you may want to watch Fire of Love and compare to Herzog's elegy to the Kraffts, called The Fire Within.",

    "content_text": "The Best Wireless Earbuds for Everyone\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nWireless earbuds are one of those ideas that sounded like a dream at first. Pop a little headphone into each ear and listen to music or take calls untethered from everything. The first wireless buds were gigantic, died after a few hours, and had a bunch of other problems. Times have changed. There are now tons of new models that sound fabulous and work perfectly, including plenty for well under $100. After testing hundreds of pairs of wireless earbuds over several years, these are our favorites in a wide range of styles and prices.\nFor more top picks, check out our other audio guides, like the Best Wireless Headphones, Best Noise-Canceling Headphones, Best Cheap Headphones, Best Workout Headphones, and Best Wired Headphones.\nUpdated April 2025: We've added the Technics EAH-AZ100, the Soundcore Aeroclip, the Audio-Technica ATH-CKS50TW2, and the Beyerdynamic Amiron 300, and updated links and prices.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nHow We Define Wireless Earbuds\nWe've seen this category go by many names: true wireless earbuds, truly wireless earbuds, completely wireless earbuds, fully wireless earbuds, wirefree earbuds, etc. These days, if a pair of earbuds connects to your phone/computer via Bluetooth and has no cord that connects the left bud to the right, we just call them wireless. Wireless sets typically come with two popcorn-sized buds, each with a battery inside, and a charging cradle that carries extra battery power and keeps them safe when you're not wearing ’em. Some wireless earbuds have a cable or neckband that connects the two buds together, usually found on workout buds from brands like Shokz.\nRidding yourself of all cords can feel liberating, but these do come with issues, such as limited battery life (don't buy any with less than five hours), confusing controls, and reliance on a charging case. They're also easier to lose than traditional earbuds, and replacing one bud can be expensive. That said, this is one of the most innovative categories in tech, offering a flurry of new features from heart rate monitors to OTC hearing aid functionality, with more added in each new generation. These days features like noise canceling and transparency mode are standard, while the burgeoning open-ear category offers a more natural way to keep aware of your surrounding.\nOther Earbuds We Like\nEvery month seems to bring new sets of earbuds with longer battery life, new features, and more compact designs. As such, we can't list everything we like. But if you're still hunting, here are some other recommendations.\nBeyerdynamic Amiron 300 for $280: These premium earbuds from Beyerdynamic (8/10, WIRED Recommends) look nondescript and sound fantastic, but they lack any of the superlative qualities of the buds on the list above. If you're after a clean-looking pair of headphones with fantastic vocal definition, they're worth considering.\nSoundcore Space A40 for $60: While they're no longer on our main list, the Space A40 are still some of my favorite buds for the money, providing good features, clear sound, and excellent noise canceling for their price class. They also look polished, with only their lack of auto-pause sensors betraying their low price.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro for $100-200: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are getting older, but they're still among the best buds to pair with a Samsung phone. They don't have the multi-device connectivity of our top pick for Android users, and their five-hour battery is looking pretty short these days, but they provide excellent sound quality, IPX7 waterproofing, and a distinctive design that doesn't just ape the AirPods Pro. That makes them well worth considering on sale.\nPixel Buds A Series for $99: These used to be our top pick for most people, but they're now overshadowed by other affordable options that also include things like noise canceling. If you can find a pair on sale, they're still worth snagging, especially if you have an Android phone.\nSoundpeats Air4 for $76: Soundpeats’ Air4 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) may be obvious AirPods Pro knockoffs, but they're very good knockoffs for the money. You won't get top-flight performance, let alone Apple exclusives like Find My support or iCloud sharing, but you will get good sound and features, including decent noise canceling, at a massive discount. While these aren't a top choice, they're a great budget buy, especially on sale.\nSony Linkbuds Fit for $200: Sony’s Linkbuds Fit offer rich and punchy sound, naturalistic transparency mode, and a light and comfy fit, helping them live up to their intent as a “wear anywhere” solution. They provide some solid features, but skimp on battery life with just 5.5 hours per charge, and their noise canceling is just OK. Their oddly unresponsive touch controls and reliance on flimsy silicone sleeves further diminish their value, but they're still Sony buds and could be worth nabbing on a good sale.\nMontblanc MTB 03 for $395: These earbuds are priced out of reach for most buyers, but if you've got the cash, you'll be rewarded with a luxury experience worthy of the brand. Montblanc has called in some heavy hitters from the audio industry to design and voice these buds. The result is a small, comfortable, and quite flashy-looking pair of wireless earbuds that sound really impressive.\nRaycon Everyday Earbuds for $80: These YouTuber-beloved earbuds are actually a decent cheap pair (7/10, WIRED Review). They are small and light, and they come with an IPX6 rating, which makes them great for workouts.\nMaster & Dynamic MW08 Sport for $399: The Sport are a great option that come with active noise canceling and a striking design, but the high price keeps them out of the reach of most people.\nEarbuds to Avoid\nAs a general rule, you should avoid earbuds that don't support the Bluetooth 5.0 standard (or higher) or don't offer at least five hours of battery life, and more like six these days. Batteries in wireless headphones degrade over time, so the better your battery life is at first, the more tolerable it will be in two to three years.\nApple's standard AirPods (previous or current gen) for $119-170: These headphones do some things well, we just don't like them all that much. (Read our latest review.) They get OK battery life, come in a compact case, and work well for calls, but they don't fit all ears well, and since they don't have ear tips or wings, you're out of luck if they're loose. The priciest model adds noise canceling which works about as well as you'd expect for a pair that doesn't offer a proper seal. Want clear music, good noise canceling, and advanced features made for iPhones? Get the AirPods Pro Gen 2, which sometimes cost more (and sometimes less) but are legitimately great.\nBeats Solo Buds for $80: These are lackluster in virtually every possible way (6/10, WIRED Review), especially when it comes to features for the money. Their best traits are their micro-size and big battery, but that's about it. It's odd, because we like other headphones from the brand, but these just don't keep pace. The best we can say is they are cheap.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 for $180: A Cybertrucked pair of AirPods clones (5/10, WIRED Review), the headphones in the new Galaxy Buds line work worse than they already look. With no eartips, these are uncomfortable to wear for long periods, and the noise canceling is all but useless.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nWhether you have an old phone languishing in a desk drawer or a broken laptop gathering dust in the back of a closet, there will never be a better time to dispose of it. There’s a good chance your unwanted gadget can return to useful service, and it may even make you a little cash or help someone else. Recycling should be the last resort, but if there’s nothing else for your gadget, there are ways to recycle electronics responsibly.\nGlobal e-waste topped 62 million metric tons in 2022, according to the United Nations Global E-Waste Monitor, and just 22.3 percent of that waste was collected and recycled. Too many old electronics end up in landfills and hellish e-waste graveyards in poor countries, where they poison communities. The problem is only growing worse. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) forum estimates that 5.3 billion phones were dropped out of use in 2022 alone. Governments, companies, and people are waking up to the fact that we must do better. The big question is, how? Here are some resources, services, and ideas that can help.\nUpdated April 2025: We updated the statistics and expanded donation suggestions.\nUse Devices for Longer\nBefore you throw away devices, consider using them for a little longer. Do you really need to upgrade? Perhaps you can repurpose your old device to get more life out of it. For example, you might turn that old phone into a webcam. If you are dead set on shopping for a new device, research ethical and eco-friendly electronics. Look for manufacturers and retailers with trade-in and recycling programs.\nConsider buying used products on eBay or other marketplaces, or look for refurbished gadgets. Manufacturers like Apple and Samsung offer refurbished devices at a discount, and you can find loads of refurbished goods at Amazon. Elizabeth Chamberlain, director of sustainability at iFixit, recommends Back Market for refurbished phones. For more tips and ideas, we have a guide on how to buy used or refurbished electronics.\nPass Devices On\nPassing devices onto family members, friends, and neighbors who can use them is the best way to squeeze maximum value out of them. “Don’t let devices hibernate in a junk drawer or closet and waste away,” says Jeff Seibert, who works at SERI (Sustainable Electronics Recycling International). “Get them into someone else’s hands who can use them as quickly as possible because the older devices get, the less positive impact they can make.”\nIf you don’t know anyone who can use your old electronics, try the Freecycle Network or local Buy Nothing groups on Facebook to find folks interested in freebies.\nRepair and Refurbish\nWhether you plan to squeeze a bit more out of a device, want to pass it along to someone, or plan on selling it, repairing or refurbishing it first is a smart move. If you want to try and repair a device, iFixit is a great place to start. It boasts more than 90,000 step-by-step repair guides covering phones, tablets, laptops, computers, game consoles, and cameras.\nYouTube is another great place to find repair videos, and Chamberlain recommends checking out repair techs like Louis Rossmann, Jessa Jones, Ben’s Appliances and Junk, and Rich Rebuilds, but there's no shortage of repair videos for the specific gadget you're looking for.\nTo meet repair experts face-to-face and learn how to fix your gadgets, look for a repair café in your area. These local pop-up events offer free advice and knowledge exchange from expert repairers to help people in the neighborhood get stuff fixed. Instead of dropping devices off for repair, you sit with the expert and learn how to troubleshoot for yourself. The Restart Project is a good resource for folks in the UK looking to repair or donate devices.\nOne thing to be mindful of when attempting to repair a phone, laptop, or another device with a battery inside is to drain the battery before you open it up. For repairs on major white-good appliances, rubber gloves and rubber-soled boots can minimize the risk of getting shocked.\nIf you lack the confidence to attempt repairs, you can likely find a good local repair shop by reading reviews. The Federal Trade Commission found that independent repair shops have the same success rate and safety record as manufacturer shops. Many manufacturers have discouraged repairs with the threat of voiding a warranty, but victories for the Right to Repair movement have led to tech getting slightly more repairable.\nJust be careful to back up and protect sensitive data on your devices before handing them in at repair shops. Some devices might even have a built-in solution. For example, Samsung phone owners can activate Maintenance Mode before handing a device off to ensure that photos and accounts can’t be accessed (we still advise backing up before you send any device for repair).\nSell or Trade\nYou can make some money if you sell old devices. Even broken devices can be sold for parts, though you will always command a higher fee if you clean and repair them first. You can also score a discount on something new with trade-in or buyback schemes. We have guides on how to sell or trade in your iPhone (remember to factory reset it first) and how to sell your smartwatch or fitness tracker.\nYou can generally command the highest fees by selling directly to people through eBay, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, or Nextdoor. Just remember that you will need to arrange delivery or meet up to exchange the goods, and buyers often like to haggle. (Trade in or buy refurbished electronics on eBay with our eBay discounts.)\nFor a hassle-free sale, consider places like Swappa or Gazelle. These kinds of buyers use online questionnaires to determine a price and often provide free postage. Shop around and see who offers the best price, but be honest in your descriptions, or you may find that your quote gets reduced after inspection.\nTake-back or trade-in programs are easy options, though you probably won’t make as much as you would through a sale, and often, you might get your fee as store credit. Best Buy, Amazon, Verizon, Samsung, Walmart, and many others offer trade-ins on electronics.\nDonate\nIf you like the idea of your old electronics doing some good, consider donating them to worthy causes. Chamberlain says Goodwill is one of the best options because the company has a strong reuse hierarchy and aims to get as much as it can out of electronics before recycling them. You can also find local charities that accept electronics through Donation Town.\nCell Phones for Soldiers is a nonprofit that sends overseas troops prepaid mobile phones so they can stay in touch with loved ones. Secure the Call accepts phone and tablet donations and supplies them to victims of domestic violence, senior citizens, and other vulnerable folks in the community. You can donate old electronics to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, where partner Cellular Recycler refurbishes and resells them. Recycle Health is another nonprofit that collects fitness trackers and gives them to underserved populations to encourage fitness.\nFor folks in the UK, Three, Vodafone, and Hubbub all run schemes to take old phones and give them to people in need.\nResearch and Recycle\nIf you can't reuse, repair, sell, or donate, it is important to recycle your old electronics properly. Anything with a battery inside must not be thrown into the general waste, because discarded batteries can leak toxic chemicals into the environment and start fires. But we're not just talking about phones and laptops here; you should also try to recycle smaller items, like cables and chargers.\nSome of the places we have already mentioned will recycle devices that can't be reused, and it's worth checking to see whether the original manufacturer of your device has a recycling scheme. Most major manufacturers, including Apple, Google, and Samsung, will recycle your old devices, and Apple will take old Lightning cables if you're making the switch to USB-C. Retailers like Best Buy and Staples will also accept and recycle your old phones, laptops, cables, and other electronics.\nThe US Department of Energy launched a $14 million program in 2024 to fund more than 1,000 consumer collection sites across the country at Staples and Batteries Plus stores to make it easier for Americans to recycle batteries. All sorts of batteries, including rechargeable batteries, those in cell phones, laptops, vacuums, and smartwatches—but not EV batteries—will be collected at these sites, so valuable resources can be extracted and recycled.\nLocal facilities that handle electronics for reuse and recycling sometimes have community drop-off events, Seibert says, and local municipalities often have electronics collections once or twice a year, so it’s worth looking to see whether there are any scheduled in your area.\nSadly, not all recycling centers and schemes are equal. The e-Stewards certification program is focused on the responsible management of end-of-life electronics (Staples is a partner) and aligns with the Basel Convention requirements for the transboundary movement of electronic waste and components. The NAID AAA Certification and either ISO 14001 or RIOS Certification are prerequisites to being e-Stewards certified. It conducts unannounced inspections and uses GPS trackers to test partners and ensure materials are responsibly managed at every stage. You can use its global interactive map to find certified partners and locations to drop off old electronics.\nAnother option is SERI, which administers the R2 Standard to set best practices for protecting the environment, worker health and safety, and natural resources. An R2 Certified facility will ensure that any used electronics are processed responsibly, including any residual data on devices. While most aren’t set up for consumer drop-off, there is a search tool to filter for those that are.\nYou can also find a long list of international e-waste recycling links at iFixit, find recycling locations through Earth 911, and check out Call 2 Recycle for batteries.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Instead of a smelly bucket of vegetable scraps and coffee grounds breeding fruit flies on your counter or attracting rats to your backyard, you could just put it all into a nifty electric gadget, and at some undetermined point in the future you'll have a bountiful supply of nutrient-rich compost to use in your garden.\nUnfortunately, none of the more popular electric machines on the market do this. Even though some of these devices are marketed as “composters\" and have instruction booklets and apps detailing all the ways in which one can use compost, the vast majority of kitchen composters are just going to grind up and dry your food scraps. Your waste output will be greatly reduced in volume and will no longer smell, but if you’re hoping to put eggshells and banana peels into a machine and magically scoop out the kind of true compost you’d buy at the garden center, that’s just not going to happen.\nThat said, you can mix small amounts of these grounds into potting soil in very small ratios, or use them as feeder for a “real” compost pile, but most of these machines are meant for those wanting to reduce the volume of food waste their household produces. Which is in and of itself a legitimate goal, as cast-off food makes up 24 percent of municipal solid waste, resulting in the release of methane, a destructive greenhouse gas, as it breaks down in the landfill.\nOr maybe you'd just like your food grounds to be odor-free and shelf-stable before adding them to your green waste bin for municipal composting or your backyard compost. In any case, despite critics’ cries of greenwashing and corporate astroturfing, there is still value to these devices. They make people more aware of their food waste. They don't use as much power as you think they would (around 1 kilowatt-hour was typical). And our top pick, the Reencle Prime (8/10, WIRED Recommends), even produces something close to compost.\nRead on for our assessment, and once you're done, check out some of our other kitchen-related guides, including Best Coffee Makers, Best Toaster Ovens, Best Meat Subscription Boxes, and Best Meal Kit Delivery Services.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nHow I Tested\nI'm WIRED's senior commerce editor in charge of home and kitchen devices and have been reviewing products for our Gear section for the past 10 months. I cook daily for my family of three, and I've been processing our kitchen scraps in these composters in my home kitchen since summer 2024. Each was tested under typical household use for a minimum of four weeks each, and in several cases six weeks or longer. I tested all cycles offered and with all manner of foods allowed according to the manual, and in the case of the Reencle and the Mill, even attempted to use the finished product in my yard and houseplants (to varying effect).\nBest Overall\nAs previously mentioned, none of these machines make truly ready-to-use compost, but the Reencle Prime (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes closest to a traditional compost bin. Popular in South Korea years before it appeared in the US, the Reencle arrives with a starter bag of ReencleMicrobe (which can be purchased separately for $65) containing activated carbon, wood pellets, glucose, and a trio of patented microbes ready to chow down. There's also a prefilled carbon filter that slots into the back.\nAt 14 x 15 x 22 inches, the Prime is too large for a kitchen counter but instead conveniently operates much like a heated trash can. The lid can be opened via sensor at the bottom or a button on the control panel, and in goes your organic matter. That's it. There are no cycles, tablets, or auxiliary buckets to worry about. Even the app is totally optional. Within hours to days, depending on the item, the scraps are broken down into a material resembling a cross between dirt and sawdust.\nThe smell isn't always pleasant, but it can usually be mitigated by the control panel's Dry and Purify buttons or by adding what in composting lexicon is called “browns”—dry, carbon-rich materials like bread or shredded paper. The Reencle also tends not to smell when it's being fed its preferred diet of 1.5 pounds of scraps per day. Unlike other machines, it can also accept meat and dairy. For larger households, there's the Reencle Gravity ($600), which is a couple of inches taller and can accept 3.3 pounds of waste a day. I also tested this and found it to be significantly quieter than the Prime—not that the Prime is noticeably loud, only about 30 or so decibels, but the Gravity is nearly silent, which is a nice bonus.\nWhen the volume reaches the fill line, the Reencle grounds can be scooped out and added at a 1:4 ratio with potting soil, then left to cure for three weeks (I used a large tub in my garage), after which it can be used for both outdoor and indoor plants. I have used this resultant mix to positive effect both indoors and outdoors.\n|Dimensions\n|12 x 13 x 18.4 inches\n|Capacity:\n|Minimum 1.5 lbs., maximum 2.2 lbs.\n|Can't process:\n|Large bones or shells, fruit pits\n|Fastest waste breakdown:\n|2 to 24 hours or longer, depending\n|How to use its output:\n|Sift, mix 1:4 ratio with soil, cure for 3 weeks and add to plants indoors or outdoors; add to compost pile\n|Warranty:\n|1 year\nRunner-Up: FoodCycler Eco 3\nFirst off, I appreciate that FoodCycler doesn’t even pretend it's making a composter. “The FoodCycler is a food waste recycler,” the company explained firmly before agreeing to ship a test unit. “Our primary goal is to provide a modern food waste solution for users who may lack access to traditional composting or other disposal options that divert from the landfill. Therefore, the resulting byproduct cannot be labeled as ‘compost.’” And indeed—the FoodCycler breaks down food so quickly, and with no microbial involvement, that there’s no way anyone could think this was proper compost. But if you are going to go with a grinder/dryer, the Eco 3 is one of the most efficient ones you can buy.\nLaunched in 2024, the Eco 3 is a smaller version of the Vitamix FoodCycler FC-50 (7/10, WIRED Review), sporting a larger 3.5-liter capacity and, according to FoodCycler, better grinding capability. At 11 x 9 x 13 inches, it is small enough to sit on a counter- or tabletop, though the real convenience with this machine is its auxiliary pail. Fill the sleek, 8-inch-tall lidded container with scraps (in my household of three people, this took about three days), and once it's full, swap out the lids, seat it in the machine, and press a button.\nA few hours later, you'll have a handful of “Foodilizer,” a \"homemade soil amendment” that looks like finely ground dirt. In fact, the output is the most finely ground of any of these machines. There's no assembly with this machine (other than filling a filter with carbon granules), no app, no making an account, no pods or tablets or choosing various cycles—you don't even have to plug it in until you're ready to use it.\nThe cycle runs from four to nine hours depending on the water content of the scraps, and it produces an audible but unobtrusive whir (about 36 dB on my decibel meter). I did occasionally have trouble getting the bucket to seat correctly, but the manual addresses this, and I was always able to get it right after a couple of tries.\n|Dimensions:\n|11 x 9 x 13 inches\n|Capacity:\n|3.5 L\n|Can't process:\n|Compostable plastics, beef bones, candy, oils/fats\n|Fastest waste breakdown:\n|4 to 9 hours\n|How to use its output:\n|Mix with soil at 1:10 ratio, or 1:15 if using meat/dairy; add to compost; sprinkle on your lawn\n|Warranty:\n|3 years\nBest for Nonfood Compostables\nThe Lomi 2 is the new smart version of the original Lomi, which WIRED contributor Richard Baguley rated a 7/10 in 2022. It has an app with three cycles that serve different purposes” “Eco-Express\" for quick breakdown; “Grow” for grounds to use in your yard; and “Lomi Approved” for approved bioplastics and related items. Like the FoodCycler, Pela straightforwardly markets this as a food grinder and dehydrator—the Lomi does not make real compost, and its primary purpose is to either reduce the volume of scraps in your trash can or process the scraps to be added to a “real” compost pile. However, it does perform these tasks well and for several hundred dollars less than the Mill (below).\nWhen I first unboxed the sleek-looking 2, I watched the setup video in Lomi's app, where an actor removed items from the packaging, including a bag of Lomi Pods, a microbial “nutrient activator” for Grow mode (45 tablets for $30). My machine did not come with Lomi Pods, and it turned out these both need to be purchased separately and are optional, in case you plan to add the resultant “Lomi Earth” from the Grow mode to your garden (at a 1:10 ratio).\nAt 16 x 13 x 12 inches, the Lomi is small enough to sit on a counter or table, though it is on the larger side—about the size of a small microwave—so it will take a significant outlay of counter space. There's an activated charcoal filter, which you fill with a baggie of granules. Scraps (including meat and dairy!) go right in the bucket set into the machine, which means you have to open and close the lid each time you add something. (Unlike the Reencle, above, or Vego, below, scraps can't be added during a cycle.) Though the lid wasn't hard to get on and off, it was enough of a pain that I found myself using the bucket from the FoodCycler, above, lined with a Matter compostable food scrap bag. When it was full, I just threw the whole thing in the Lomi, bag and all.\nWhich leads me to perhaps the best feature of the Lomi 2: It can break down compostable bioplastics, like bags. In fact, the Lomi itself comes in a giant compostable bag, which, when torn into pieces, can be processed down to what looks like dehydrated lettuce right in the machine. It should be noted, though, that Lomi recommends only 10 percent nonfood waste per cycle. (I exceeded this percentage on multiple occasions to no negative effect, but rules are rules.)\nYou can also earn points in Lomi's app each time you run a cycle (up to 10 points for a Grow cycle), to redeem for things like filter refills (like the FoodCycler, Lomi uses activated charcoal granules), phone cases from Lomi parent company Pela, or merch from partners like Pakt. The app also has a helpful, searchable database telling you what can or can’t go in. However, the Lomi makes significantly more noise during its cycles (46 dB) compared to the Reencle, but the trade-off is that it is totally odorless with its lid sealed. Update April 30, 2025: Lomi says it is pulling the Lomi 2 from the US market for now due to tariffs.\n|Dimensions:\n|16 x 13 x 12 inches\n|Capacity:\n|3 L\n|Can't process:\n|Beef bones, candy, oils/fats\n|Fastest waste breakdown:\n|3 hours in Eco Express mode\n|How to use its output:\n|Mix with soil at 1:10 ratio, or 1:15 if using meat/dairy; add to compost; spread on your lawn\n|Warranty:\n|1 year\nFastest Breakdown\nIf you have a surfeit of stinky kitchen waste and want it dry and broken down lightning fast—say, in two hours, the quickest of any machine on this list—the Vego is your machine. It's roughly the same size and dimensions as the Lomi, with many of the same operational features but the distinction of being significantly less expensive. However, there are definitely some inconveniences that go along with the price point.\nFor one, like the Lomi, scraps need to be added into the bucket seated in the machine. You can remove the bucket, but unlike the FoodCycler, there's no separate lid for the bucket and the metal mechanism underneath is exposed. Further, the lid to the machine is a bona fide pain to get on and off, requiring a precise lining up of notches and two hands to wrench it open or closed. Not easy to do with fists full of scraps. It's also got four different cycles to choose from—Vego, Express, Fertilize, and Grass. I tried them all. Express mode results in grounds that look more roughly chopped, as with the Mill, but there seemed to be little visual difference among the others, including Vego mode.\nVego claims its Vego mode does create a biologically active soil amendment when processed with one of the included VegoTabs (packet of 30, $25 if purchased separately). These “compost enhancer tablets\" can be added during the Vego, Fertilize, and Grass modes. You can also add scraps while it's in Vego mode, and there's a clear lid and nifty light inside in case you want to watch the process.\nIn all modes, but Vego mode especially, the barrel turns every couple of minutes, emitting a loud whirring. Because the sound isn't constant, it's more noticeable. Even from 10 feet away, I found it obtrusive enough to want to turn up the TV volume. The Vego has an app, but it's meh at best, unhelpful at worst. It tells you the weight of scraps you've added (why?), as well as the benefits of and directions for using finished compost, which is not what is produced by the machine. There's also completely unrelated information about composting outside. However, this is the best entry-level option of this type of machine, so it's worth a look if you plan on having a separate bucket setup.\n|Dimensions:\n|14.37 × 11.22 × 12.64 inches\n|Capacity:\n|4 L\n|Can't process:\n|Meat, dairy, fat/oils, hard items like fruit pits or beef bones\n|Fastest waste breakdown:\n|2 to 24 hours depending on cycle\n|How to use its output:\n|Mix with soil at 1:10 ratio, add to existing compost, spread on lawn\n|Warranty:\n|1 year\nLargest Capacity\nAll of these machines do a great job breaking down food scraps in some way or another, but still don't fully address what one is supposed to do with them absent a yard or compost pile. Adding them at a 1:10 (or 1:15!) ratio to potting soil is kind of a pain, and many people don't have the space to store all this dirt. The Mill is the only device that addresses this issue by allowing users to ship their grounds in a box via USPS to a farm in Washington state that repurposes them for chicken feed.\nWhen I first tested the Mill (6/10, WIRED Review), I didn't care for this idea, which seemed inefficient at best, and canceling out the benefit of recycling the food waste at worst. I also didn't love the coarse texture of the grounds, having tried to use them in my garden and finding them too easily rehydrated. The price also seemed over the top for what's essentially an oversized Lomi. But if you're looking to reduce the amount of food waste leaving your house, the Mill has the best ease of use, requiring the least amount of work on a user's part.\nLike the Reencle, it acts as a big trash can—you can throw in whatever you'd like at any time, and you can program a cycle any time you'd like via the app, which is exceedingly complete and user-friendly. There's an almost encyclopedic directory of what can and can't go in the machine, as well as a tracker that shows how many pounds of waste you've diverted over time. The Mill also has such a massive capacity that it only needs to be emptied about once a month, a claim I found to be accurate during my testing period. It's on the louder side at around 60 dB, so I highly recommend scheduling its processing cycle to run at night. Mill had stopped its rental program when we first published our initial review, but it looks like it's back up again for $35 a month or $420 a year.\n|Dimensions:\n|27 x 16 x 15 inches\n|Capacity:\n|6.5 L, or 40 pounds\n|Can't process:\n|Large bones or shells, large amounts of oil or sugar/candy, compostable plastics/packaging, moldy meat\n|Fastest waste breakdown:\n|3 hours to up to 24 hours\n|How to use its output:\n|Send in provided boxes to a farm, add to your own compost, feed to your chickens, add to soil at a ratio of 8 cups per 10 square feet\n|Warranty:\n|Five years (for units purchased on or after March 17, 2025)",

Instead of a smelly bucket of vegetable scraps and coffee grounds breeding fruit flies on your counter or attracting rats to your backyard, you could just put it all into a nifty electric gadget, and at some undetermined point in the future you'll have a bountiful supply of nutrient-rich compost to use in your garden.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Unfortunately, none of the more popular electric machines on the market do this. Even though some of these devices are marketed as “composters\" and have instruction booklets and apps detailing all the ways in which one can use compost, the vast majority of kitchen composters are just going to grind up and dry your food scraps. Your waste output will be greatly reduced in volume and will no longer smell, but if you’re hoping to put eggshells and banana peels into a machine and magically scoop out the kind of true compost you’d buy at the garden center, that’s just not going to happen.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">That said, you <em>can</em> mix small amounts of these grounds into potting soil in very small ratios, or use them as feeder for a “real” compost pile, but most of these machines are meant for those wanting to reduce the volume of food waste their household produces.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nWe all love shiny new electronics. But every new smartphone or laptop comes with baggage. Weighing climate dread, terrible conditions for workers, energy usage, and worries over hellish ewaste graveyards can quickly kill your excitement about shopping for a new gadget. None of us wants to be complicit, but what can you do if these issues concern you?\nSadly, there’s no easy way to find ethically manufactured and eco-friendly electronics. But there are things you can do to reduce any negative impact your purchases may have. Here are a few ideas we’ve compiled, with the help of Tom Bryson, tech specialist at Ethical Consumer, a UK magazine that ranks brands based on various categories, from environmental reporting to workers’ rights.\nUpdated April 2025: We added Retrospekt to our recommended brands and some useful links.\nRepair What You Have\nThe best way to minimize your impact is to avoid buying new devices if you can. The unpalatable truth is that every new gadget has a cost in manufacturing, shipping, operating life, and, eventually, waste.\n“Most of the environmental impact, including carbon emissions, occurs during the manufacturing stage,” Bryson says. “It is estimated that the electricity consumption of actually using a smartphone accounts for as little as 1 percent of the product’s carbon emissions.”\nIt’s best to continue using what you already own or get devices repaired to extend their lifespan wherever possible. Thankfully, this is becoming easier with the US Federal Trade Commission voting to enforce the right to repair. Manufacturers like Apple and Samsung are starting to offer guides and repair kits, but there’s still a ways to go. If you want to check into how repairable your gadgets are, iFixit has a guide, and it’s also a great place to find tutorials, guides, and all the necessary components and tools to fix your devices. You might even be able to rent iFixit kits from your local library, as one WIRED staffer found when looking to repair her Roomba.\nBuy Used or Refurbished\nMaybe your device is beyond repair, or you're shopping for a new category of device you're not too familiar with. What then? Try shopping for used or refurbished tech. You can sometimes get a discount on devices often indistinguishable from brand-new ones. You won't get as great a deal buying somewhere like Apple’s Certified Refurbished store, but you can rest assured you will get a perfectly working device in as-new condition, with a warranty.\nFor deeper discounts, you'll have to buy used from dealers or private sellers, but there’s more risk involved. Follow our advice on the best used tech to buy and check out our guides on how to buy a used phone and how to buy used devices on eBay to boost your chances of bagging a bargain while avoiding potential pitfalls.\nDo Your Research\nTo manufacture electronic devices, companies need to source numerous materials and components, usually from various countries. That often means the mining and assembly take place in countries with low wages and scant protections for workers. “This complexity means it is difficult to say with certainty that any device is produced in a fully ethical manner that does not involve exploitation of workers and does not damage the environment,” Bryson says.\nWhat you can do is take a hard look at the manufacturer behind the device you want and consider which issues are most important to you. Ideally, the company will have strong policies on managing workers' rights issues in the supply chain and sourcing materials in an eco-friendly way. Look for evidence on how a company is reducing its carbon emissions in line with science-based targets, and find out if it's attempting to reduce harmful chemicals in its products. Also, consider tax avoidance and policy transparency.\nSearching for news stories and digging into a company's websites to see what issues they talk about can amount to a lot of work. Websites like Ethical Consumer have done some of the legwork here to condense this information into score tables for devices like laptops and smartphones.\nStandards to Look For\nSeveral standards and labels can help you assess the environmental and ethical impact of different tech devices. It's worth looking for the EPEAT (Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool) label, which is managed by the Global Electronics Council. Registered products must meet various criteria for environmental performance and impact.\nBryson recommends TCO Certified, a sustainability label for tech products that considers the broad range of social and environmental factors in every product's lifecycle. To score a TCO-Certified label, devices must meet criteria relating to the design and manufacture, including workers’ rights, conflict minerals, hazardous chemicals, user health and safety, durability, and recyclability.\nConsider Energy Use\nConsumer electronics require power to run. Some of that energy will likely come from burning fossil fuels, and the more power your chosen device or appliance needs, the higher your electricity bills will be. Many devices have labels that reveal their energy efficiency. Choosing more energy-efficient appliances and using eco modes can save a substantial amount of power over the lifetime of a device.\nIn the US, you will often see the government-backed Energy Star label, which means the device conforms to energy efficiency standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. You can also find an EnergyGuide label on some appliances that displays estimated annual running costs and energy usage. Energy labels in the UK and the EU show energy efficiency on a scale of A to G, energy consumption, and other details such as volume, noise, and water consumption, where relevant.\nSwitching to LED from incandescent or halogen bulbs can significantly reduce energy use and bills. Even smart bulbs and other kinds of smart lighting often require less power than traditional lights.\nIt’s also worth buying rechargeable batteries instead of single-use disposable batteries, but we recommend choosing carefully, as some cheaper rechargeable batteries don’t perform as well or last as long as they should. My pick, recommended in our Best Portable Chargers guide, is Panasonic’s Eneloop range.\nFinding Ethical and Eco-Friendly Brands\nCompanies are good at highlighting the fact that they use ocean-reclaimed plastic in a particular device or how they donated a percentage of their profits to a worthy cause, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they are truly ethical or eco-friendly. Here are a small handful of brands that seem to have a deeper commitment to doing the right thing.\n- Fairphone: The first name that sprang to mind (and the only company Bryson and Ethical Consumer recommended), Fairphone has been talking about conflict minerals and striving to reduce their use since its inception. The company is also committed to ethical supply chain management and produces modular and repairable phones.\n- Nimble: The power banks, cables, and other accessories Nimble offers are made using recycled and renewable materials. It also uses plastic-free packaging and provides free pre-paid shipping so you can send any old electronic devices, plastic cases, cables, and more to the company's ewaste recycling partner. Nimble produces an annual Impact Report that includes details of its third-party certifications.\n- Humanscale: This office furniture brand constantly strives to minimize its carbon footprint, not only to avoid negative impact but also to have an overall net positive impact on the world. The company outlines its progress in an annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report.\n- Kerf: Kerf makes wooden phone cases and mobile accessories using local wood sourced from Urban Tree. Cases are made to order, using only solid wood, and Kerf claims to use 95 percent of the raw materials it sources. The company does not use plastic and offers carbon-neutral shipping.\n- Retrospekt: With a dedicated team of technicians skilled in refurbishing and repairing, Retrospekt is dedicated to analog gear. They focus on Polaroid cameras, but you will also find cassettes, vinyl, iPods, Game Boys, VCRs, VHS tapes, typewriters, and more on sale, all lovingly restored and cleaned, fully working with a limited warranty. There are refurbished Polaroid cameras, but also refurbished internals with new, super cute exteriors based on collaborations with brands like Peanuts, Hello Kitty, and Barbie. Retrospekt also offers a repair service for some Polaroid cameras and Sony Walkmans.\n- Oakywood: Like Kerf, Oakywood turns out a wide range of beautiful, high-quality wooden products like headphone stands for your desktop using sustainable materials, including solid certified wood, ecological oils, Portuguese cork, and merino wool felt. The company also plants a tree for every product sold through a partnership with the nonprofit One Tree Planted.\n- House of Marley: Primarily an audio brand making speakers and headphones using sustainable bamboo, recycled aluminum, and reclaimed organic cotton, House of Marley also plants trees through One Tree Planted and supports the Surfrider Foundation.\n- MPOWERD: This brand makes a range of solar charging lanterns, lights, and batteries that are ideal for outdoor types. It also works with nongovernmental organizations and nonprofits to provide clean energy lanterns to people living in poverty around the world.\nFinding Ethical Retailers\nChoosing who you buy your electronics from is important, but it is complicated. Buying local from small businesses is best, but that’s getting tougher to do with electronics. Big retailers have their fingers in so many pies that it can be very tough to choose where to go. Some companies are great on working conditions but not so much on sustainability, and vice versa.\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency has an interesting chart that shows the top 30 retailers for green power use, and it's a good example of something you might want to consider when choosing a retailer.\n- Costco has a strong reputation for treating its workers right, with some of the best pay and benefits, but despite its commitment to sustainability, most reports suggest it could do more on that front. Costco produces an Annual Report outlining its code of ethics and employee benefits.\n- Best Buy also treats its workers well, has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040, and runs the largest ewaste recycling scheme in the US. Best Buy publishes an annual Environmental, Social, and Governance Report with details of its worker programs and sustainability efforts.\nFor folks in the UK, Richer Sounds and John Lewis have employee-owned models, so workers share in the profits, and the Co-operative Group is member-owned. Richer Sounds has also campaigned for fairer tax.\nWhat About Greenwashing?\nYou'll often see descriptions like “eco-friendly,” “green,” and “sustainable” used by many companies to make products more appealing. Bryson says to avoid taking these claims at face value. Instead, take a closer look. It’s common for companies to use a small percentage of recycled material in the casing of a device or offer a \"low energy\" setting, then crow about it to buy some goodwill. But many of the same companies do nothing to rectify the profound environmental and social issues associated with electronics supply chains.\nHow to Dispose of Your Old Electronics\nWhen you upgrade to new gadgets, try to find a useful life for your old gear. You can often repurpose your old gadgets or pass them on to someone who can use them. One rule to remember: “Never place broken electronics directly into your bin to be sent to landfill, as they can leak toxic chemicals into the land,” Bryson says.\nEven phone cases should not be thrown in the trash. Kerf will repair cases for free or offer up to 50 percent discounts on replacement cases when you send your old case back. Casetify offers a 15 percent discount on a new case when you send in your old case (from any brand), and Sonix offers 30 percent off new cases when you donate your old case. We can go on and on, but before you buy, it's worth looking at whether the brand has any similar kinds of initiatives.\nAt the very least, make sure your devices are properly recycled. You can find a handy list of international ewaste recycling links at iFixit. Manufacturers like Apple and Microsoft will take old devices. Dell will even take electronics it didn’t manufacture. And you can recycle any electronics at Best Buy. Make sure you read our guide on how to sell, donate, or recycle your old devices.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

The unpalatable truth is that every new gadget has a cost in manufacturing, shipping, operating life, and, eventually, waste.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">“Most of the environmental impact, including carbon emissions, occurs during the manufacturing stage,” Bryson says. “It is estimated that the electricity consumption of actually using a smartphone accounts for as little as 1 percent of the product’s carbon emissions.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">It’s best to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/back-market-ifixit-partnership-repair/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">continue using what you already own</a> or get devices repaired to extend their lifespan wherever possible. Thankfully, this is becoming easier with the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-votes-to-enforce-right-to-repair/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">US Federal Trade Commission voting to enforce the right to repair</a>. Manufacturers like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-self-service-repair-right-to-repair-iphone-mac/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/samsungs-galaxy-repair-kits-better-than-nothing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a> are starting to offer guides and repair kits, but there’s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-repair-kits-expensive/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">still a ways to go</a>.

You might even be able to rent iFixit kits from your local library, as one WIRED staffer found when looking to repair her Roomba.</p><p id=\"two\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Buy Used or Refurbished</h2></p><p class=\"paywall\">Maybe your device is beyond repair, or you're shopping for a new category of device you're not too familiar with. What then? <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-buy-refurbished-electronics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Try shopping for used or refurbished tech</a>. You can sometimes get a discount on devices often indistinguishable from brand-new ones. You won't get <em>as</em> great a deal buying somewhere like <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://fave.co/3DZj0JK\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://fave.co/3DZj0JK\" href=\"https://fave.co/3DZj0JK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s Certified Refurbished store</a>, but you can rest assured you will get a perfectly working device in as-new condition, with a warranty.</p><p class=\"paywall\">For deeper discounts, you'll have to buy used from dealers or private sellers, but there’s more risk involved. Follow our advice on the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-best-used-tech-to-buy-sell/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best used tech to buy</a> and check out our guides on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-buy-a-used-phone/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">how to buy a used phone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-buy-used-on-ebay/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">how to buy used devices on eBay</a> to boost your chances of bagging a bargain while avoiding potential pitfalls.</p><p id=\"three\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Do Your Research</h2></p><p class=\"paywall\">To manufacture electronic devices, companies need to source numerous materials and components, usually from various countries. That often means the mining and assembly take place in countries with low wages and scant protections for workers. “This complexity means it is difficult to say with certainty that any device is produced in a fully ethical manner that does not involve exploitation of workers and does not damage the environment,” Bryson says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">What you <em>can</em> do is take a hard look at the manufacturer behind the device you want and consider which issues are most important to you. Ideally, the company will have strong policies on managing workers' rights issues in the supply chain and sourcing materials in an eco-friendly way. Look for evidence on how a company is reducing its carbon emissions in line with science-based targets, and find out if it's attempting to reduce harmful chemicals in its products.

    "content_text": "The Best Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products for Your Home\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nI’m on the hunt for the best eco-friendly cleaning products. Deep-cleaning my house used to leave me with a lot of plastic bags, paper, and plastic containers to throw away. But I’ve been trying to reduce my footprint, and for this guide I tried to find an environmentally conscious recommendation that could fit in every step of your cleaning routine, including my favorite overall: the Blueland Clean Essentials Kit ($46).\nScientists are developing new ways to recycle plastic, but it's not an Earth-friendly material, and cleaning supplies use a lot of it. The supplies below won't feel too different from what you already use, and they’re relatively affordable. For the ultimate cheap, minimalist, homemade cleaning solution, baking soda and vinegar paired with elbow grease will do the trick for many tasks (though baking soda can harm certain materials like aluminum, so do your research).\nBe sure to check out our other eco-friendly guides, like the Best Reusable Products, Best Recycled Products, and Best Clothes Made of Recycled Materials.\nUpdated April 2025: We've given this guide an overhaul with refreshed picks and updated information.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nWhat Makes a Product Eco-Friendly (or Not)?\nCommon solutions like disinfecting sprays and soaps are largely composed of water, which makes those products heavy and hard to ship efficiently. Excessive packaging is another factor in cleaning-product waste, as are harmful chemicals that can end up in the water supply (or in you). Add in the risk of microplastic shedding and a gazillion greenwashed Instagram ads, and it can be difficult to know how to make things clean and greener.\n“Eco-friendly” is an extremely vague term that can be misleading, especially in marketing. No product is perfect, but the Environmental Protection Agency has some things to look for when searching for more environmentally friendly cleaning supplies.\nProduct composition: Generally, a shorter ingredient list is better. A concentrated product produces fewer carbon emissions and creates less waste to ship than a heavier, more diluted version, and a powder or tablet is even smaller. Look for products that are biodegradable or recyclable, with few fragrances and other unnecessary additives. More things to look out for are carbon-neutral shipping and minimal packaging.\nLook for certifications: The EPA Safer Choice program vets products and certifies them if they meet the agency's standards for safer, more environmentally friendly products. Certified products feature the Safer Choice certification label on their packaging. Other certifications you may want to look for include those from the Rainforest Alliance, Leaping Bunny, and One Percent for the Planet. All of these certifications can help you make more sustainable choices when you're shopping.\nHow We Tested\nI cleaned my house! I’ve been testing some of these supplies for years and some for just a few weeks, but I used them in my day-to-day life the same way you would. I wiped up spills, I did my laundry and my dishes, and I scrubbed the kitchen sink. I have used every product in this guide in my daily (OK, sometimes weekly) cleaning routines.\nHonorable Mentions\nPapaya Reusable Paper Towels for $13: I mostly liked these cute, bright reusable paper towels, which are made from a mix of cotton and cellulose. They’re composable and absorbent. The reason they're an honorable mention is because the two-pack comes with a plastic hook. It makes sense to include something you’d need, since you’re supposed to hang these to dry them. But as best as I can tell, there’s no way to buy them without getting a plastic hook. Even if one towel replaces 17 rolls of paper towels, they’ll eventually need to be replaced, and I don’t need a gajillion hooks around (even if they are useful!). If this brand ever allows the opportunity to buy refills without a plastic hook, I’ll be more inclined to recommend it.\nFantasticlean Microfiber Cleaning Cloth Roll for $26: These tear-away microfiber towels are a solid replacement for paper towels, though microfiber is known for shedding microplastics. It feels silly to be weighing out which is worse: deforestation or plastic pollution? They’re both bad. These can be washed and reused up to 50 times, and they’re quite absorbent. I still think the cotton flannel towels above are a better pick, but if you're diligent about reusing these and you want a bulk quantity rather than the 12-pack above, these are worth looking into—especially if your house goes through a ton of paper towels like mine does.\nScrub Mommy Sponges (3-pack) for $22: This popular, cheery sponge lives up to the hype. The shape and texture make it super effective for scrubbing and wiping, and it’s durable. The reason it’s in this guide is because Scrub Daddy products are recyclable! If you need a new sponge, consider this one.\nSafely Multipurpose Cleaner for $10: This cleaner comes from Kris Jenner’s new company and is really hard to find in stock. But it smells amazing, and the majority of the ingredients come from salt, coconut, and corn. The reason it’s an honorable mention is because it isn’t concentrated like the cleaners above, making it less eco-friendly. But I still think it’s worth telling you about because it does smell great and work well.",

If this brand ever allows the opportunity to buy refills without a plastic hook, I’ll be more inclined to recommend it.</p><p><strong><a class=\"external-link\" data-aps-asc-tag=\"w050b-20\" data-aps-asin=\"B0B27ZLDLB\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3z2cX3BbZjFAzMv3qE58qM6T2uDM93sNHGGtahc5nYMDrhD7z2Lqq6RNduo5a2DM3WeLi4VPJW6ZUXTNJMykqcJQwGYXvCHNJVY9Co1XK8nCCeg59tbYyfbqDJNo2mZN3sXbEoMNDQFHKScU3Bw1EC2powtQsZSxHkmuDzwgp9rSgG423qP8Ac6ePp3SsrsJKXjp2Z6KbpFrxMChg6aZbHHhSWuz1FGrbLuHc5rQnG5RFtgmqggEcE9qxWZKxNUFZBBCvSFBgq64knCPxWRk15jvV67LiYkVBcYYULZhdvrEUf2Zs1JCyvjuEgUgmjHzwhMQHGVTccjJLS6WLqkBtSqgBjBhLqmhPTSSGhEASF3AfNccysw426iXvnyRSPWMywZyuELzpCL\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fantasticlean-Microfiber-Cleaning-Reusable-Washable/dp/B0B27ZLDLB\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3z2cX3BbZjFAzMv3qE58qM6T2uDM93sNHGGtahc5nYMDrhD7z2Lqq6RNduo5a2DM3WeLi4VPJW6ZUXTNJMykqcJQwGYXvCHNJVY9Co1XK8nCCeg59tbYyfbqDJNo2mZN3sXbEoMNDQFHKScU3Bw1EC2powtQsZSxHkmuDzwgp9rSgG423qP8Ac6ePp3SsrsJKXjp2Z6KbpFrxMChg6aZbHHhSWuz1FGrbLuHc5rQnG5RFtgmqggEcE9qxWZKxNUFZBBCvSFBgq64knCPxWRk15jvV67LiYkVBcYYULZhdvrEUf2Zs1JCyvjuEgUgmjHzwhMQHGVTccjJLS6WLqkBtSqgBjBhLqmhPTSSGhEASF3AfNccysw426iXvnyRSPWMywZyuELzpCL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fantasticlean Microfiber Cleaning Cloth Roll for $26</a>:</strong> These tear-away microfiber towels are a solid replacement for paper towels, though microfiber is known for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/microplastics-are-polluting-the-ocean-at-a-shocking-rate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shedding microplastics</a>.

    "content_text": "At the start of the year, Tom Drummond, managing partner at the San Francisco-based venture capital firm Heavybit, was feeling mildly anxious about the state of the world and how political volatility in the US might affect capital markets. Now? “No one knows what the hell is going on,” he tells WIRED.\nDrummond was referring to President Donald Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs, which sent global markets into a tailspin when they were announced on April 2. Trump later backpedaled, pausing import duties on most countries for 90 days, though a 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods has remained in place. It’s unclear what will happen when the pause ends in early July. “There’s just as much chance for these tariffs to be pulled as for Trump to dig his heels in,” says Drummond.\nSeveral venture capitalists working at small to midsize firms told WIRED in recent weeks they are concerned that Trump’s tariffs could slow down tech investments, further decelerate an already sluggish market for initial public offerings, and possibly even put some tech startups out of business. Some investors say they’re planning to lengthen their investment cycles and will be looking to sell their stakes in private companies to other asset managers. Others say that, at least for now, they’re staying away from investing in hardware companies, which may be hit particularly hard by Trump’s tariffs.\n“The tariffs are undoubtedly the main thing that was discussed in every partner meeting the past couple weeks,” says M.G. Siegler, an independent investor and former partner at GV Management Company. \"The key question is how real this ends up being, how long will it last, versus just some sort of weird temporary blip.”\nBracing for Impact\nThe biggest factor determining how much a VC firm will be impacted by the tariffs, Drummond says, is whether its portfolio companies are subject to first-order effects of the tariffs, meaning they’re directly reliant on global trade, or whether they’ll primarily feel the second-order effects of an eventual reduction in customer spending if the economy goes into a recession.\n“If you’re looking at a portfolio of industries that rely substantially on cross-border trade or transactions, like hardware, clean tech—even biotech to a degree—you’re in a world of hurt right now,” he says. One of Drummond’s portfolio companies is an internet-of-things platform, which he says is now scrutinizing its inventory management strategy, trying to determine when to order from suppliers and if it can find new ones outside of China in places like Vietnam.\nSiegler says that if the tariffs remain in place, he believes VC firms are going to “distance themselves even further from basically all hardware startups.” He adds that some investment funds have stayed away from hardware for a long time for other reasons. “Hardware is much harder and riskier than software—but this just escalated that to the nth degree.”\nChip Hazard, a Boston-based general partner and cofounder of Flybridge Capital, recently sent out an email to over 400 startup company founders urging them not to panic, but warned that capital markets are in “turmoil” and institutional investors might “freeze up,” thereby reducing access to funding, according to a copy of the message viewed by WIRED. Hazard encouraged startup founders to think through the risks and opportunities the tariffs will likely create for their businesses, as well as to evaluate their financing strategies.\n“To the extent you are midstream in raising capital, get that closed as soon as possible. We repeat, close anything midstream ASAP,” Hazard wrote. “And be really judicious about how your capital is being deployed.”\nManaging partner Charles Hudson told WIRED that his venture firm, Precursor, has stakes in several ecommerce startups that could be “heavily impacted” by Trump’s tariffs.\nBut, Hudson adds, he doesn’t know the best way to strategize around the tariffs, because “the logic for their timing, scale, and scope seems to reside only in the head of our president, and tariffs aren’t being discussed as part of the normal policy-making process that would give us more clarity.”\nPrecursor, which invests in early-stage startups, just raised more than $65 million for its fifth fund. Hudson said in a recent interview with The Information that he plans to make investments over a three-year period rather than the standard two years. The hope is that the extra time horizon will give limited partners, who supply the funding to venture capital firms, to see returns on their investments.\nHudson also predicted that selling stock in private startups on the secondary market will make up the overwhelming majority of liquidity that investors see over the next five years, rather than returns from acquisitions or initial public offerings.\nOther VCs agree that the secondary market is likely to heat up. “VCs used to be the ultimate HODLers, holding on for dear life, riding it out until a startup they invested in IPO’d,” says Drummond. “But over the past 10 years they’ve had to become much more disciplined sellers and figure out how to deliver liquidity sooner.” That’s been true for a while because of rising interest rates and VCs being more cautious, but it’s “especially true now,” he says.\nAnalysts from PitchBook, a database for statistics about the venture capital and private equity markets, warn the tariffs could have a cooling effect on international investments, noting that startups once celebrated for having “global first” strategies might now be seen as vulnerable.\nIn the first quarter of this year, prior to Trump’s official tariff announcements, a smaller share of US capital was already flowing to VC deals in Europe and China than in recent periods. Around 47 percent of European deals included US funding, down four percentage points from the final quarter of 2024.\n“For decades, VC has flourished in an increasingly borderless world, but another week of tariff wars is prompting a major reassessment,” PitchBook reporter Leah Hodgson wrote earlier this month.\nBad News for IPOs\nBefore Trump took office, investors had been hopeful that the tech IPO market would continue rebounding this year after falling into a slump in 2022. The market was showing signs of recovery in 2024: There were 176 initial public offerings in the US last year compared to 127 in 2023 and 90 in 2022, according to data collected by the consulting firm EY.\nAccounting firm KPMG noted in a report published earlier this month that “lingering market uncertainties” had led many startups to delay their imminent public debuts this quarter. The mobile banking service Chime, ticket giant StubHub, and Swedish “buy now, pay later” firm Klarna all hit pause on planned public offerings. AI infrastructure firm CoreWeave was the outlier—it began trading shares in late March.\n“With expectations for the recovery of the IPO market moving farther out again, we could see a shift in VC firms needing to reallocate investment priorities, as some companies may need additional funding prior to a now more-distant IPO,” Conor Moore, global head of KPMG Private Enterprise, said in the report.\nSome investors and analysts say there are reasons to be optimistic, despite unpredictable US trade policy and instability in the broader markets. Industries like AI, defense tech, and security could now be ripe for investment. “Pockets like defense tech might be ‘safe’ bets because those startups were trying to shy away from the Chinese supply chain anyway, for obvious reasons,” says Siegler. Logistics startups, especially those specializing in nearshoring, also stand to benefit from Trump’s policy changes.\nHazard, who sounded the alarm about the impacts of tariffs in his note to founders, and whose firm manages $1 billion in assets, says he remains particularly confident about long-term trends in AI. “If we’re headed into a period of economic uncertainty, and our AI companies are focused on helping their customers be more agile and generate more revenue, there’s a lot of potential value there,” he tells WIRED.\nAmerican companies continue to receive the lion’s share of global investment in AI, according to KPMG. OpenAI and Anthropic alone have announced investments totaling more than $43 billion this quarter. But those massive fundraising rounds are outliers that likely exclude most small and midsize investors. And a booming AI market—which includes startups that haven’t yet proven a path to profitability—may not be enough to offset the volatility of this new geopolitical era.\nStill, Hazard tells WIRED, “I’m a little less alarmed than I was two weeks ago.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nYou can save money and help save the planet by buying used or refurbished electronics instead of new devices. Since most of the environmental impact of devices comes from the manufacturing phase, buying secondhand gear can reduce your carbon footprint. Do it right, and buying refurbished can feel much like buying new. This guide delves into what you need to know about refurbished terminology, offers tips on what to look for to snag yourself the best deals, and lists some of the best places to buy refurbished gadgets and used electronics.\nYou may also be interested in How to Buy Ethical and Eco-Friendly Electronics, The Best Used Tech to Buy and Sell, What to Think About Before Buying a Used Smartphone, and How to Responsibly Dispose of Your Electronics.\nWhat Does Refurbished Mean?\nThere is no legal definition of refurbished. Some sellers preferred used, pre-loved, secondhand, reconditioned—the list continues. Refurbishment implies that the seller has tested the device and maybe repaired and cleaned it, but the only way to be sure is to read the fine print and understand what the seller means by whatever term it is using.\nIf you’re lucky, you may get an open-box device, which a buyer has opened but never actually used. Sellers are not legally allowed to resell returned devices as new, and it’s common for all returns to end up sold in the same place. At the other end of the scale, you may end up with a device that looks like it has survived the apocalypse and doesn’t work.\nTips for Buying Refurbished\nI'll recommend a few good places to buy refurbished electronics below, but first let's explore what you should look for in a seller and what you need to do to protect yourself when you buy.\nAside from working out what the seller means by refurbished, you should read the listing for any potential purchase very carefully and try to answer questions such as these:\n- Has it been tested, and does everything work?\n- Does it have a new battery or a guarantee about battery health? (This is crucial for old phones and laptops.)\n- Has it been wiped if a previous user set it up?\n- Is there any cosmetic damage like scratches or cracks? (Look for a transparent grading system.)\n- What is included? (Does it come with chargers, cables, manuals, original packaging.)\n- Is there any warranty offered? (The longer the better.)\n- If there is a problem, how do returns work? Do you have to pay, and what is the window for a return?\nIf you’re uncertain about anything, it’s worth asking before you buy to avoid disappointment.\nThere are protections for purchases, such as Section 170 of the Fair Credit Billing Act in the US or Section 75 in the UK. But you should use a credit card for purchases to get the best charge-back protection and avoid going through a third-party payment service. Some banks and credit card companies are better than others, so it's worth researching their reputations and the protections they offer.\nIf you can inspect and test devices before you buy, do it. Otherwise you should closely examine and thoroughly test any device you buy immediately when you receive it. Remember that there is a limited window to report any faults or issues with the condition and return an item. Always keep the box and packaging it arrived in at least until you are satisfied that you won’t need to return it.\nBest Places to Buy Refurbished Electronics\nYou have an enormous choice when buying refurbished electronics, so let’s break down your options.\nWe have had some good experiences buying refurbished devices from their original manufacturers, which makes sense since they know precisely how to test and repair their own devices. All of these manufacturers certify the refurbished devices they sell, and most offer at least a one-year warranty, but the savings vary; for example, Apple offers up to 15 percent off, while Dell offers up to 50 percent off.\n- Apple Certified Refurbished Store\n- Samsung Certified Re-Newed Smartphones\n- Microsoft Certified Refurbished\n- Amazon Like-New Devices\n- Dell Refurbished\n- Lenovo Certified Refurbished\n- HP Certified Refurbished Hardware\n- Nikon Refurbished Products\n- Sonos Refurbished\n- Bose Certified Refurbished\nMany big retailers and carriers offer refurbished electronics, usually as a separate store, and there are bargains to be had. Here are a few of your top options:\n- Amazon Renewed or Amazon Resale (previously Warehouse)\n- Best Buy Refurbished Electronics Outlet\n- Walmart Restored\n- Newegg Certified Refurbished Outlet\n- AT&T Certified Pre-Owned\n- Verizon Certified Pre-Owned\n- T-Mobile Certified Pre-Owned\nSeveral specialists refurbish electronics to a high standard and sell them with return policies and warranties.\nBack Market: You can find all sorts of electronics at Back Market, including smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, game consoles, headphones, speakers, and even appliances. Devices are professionally refurbished, and you can find a detailed explanation of what that means. Everything comes with a 30-day return policy (no cost to you) and a one-year warranty.\nKEH: This camera specialist offers a wide range of refurbished cameras and accessories that have been inspected, renewed, and graded. It also offers repair services and expert advice. Everything comes with a 21-day return policy (with a $25 processing fee) and a 180-day warranty.\nRetrospekt: Specializing in Polaroid cameras, Retrospekt refurbishes original cameras and combines refurbished internals with new exteriors. It also sells old game consoles, VCRs, and typewriters, as well as vinyl, cassettes, VHS tapes, camera film, and more. Devices come with a 30-day return policy (with return shipping costs and a 10 percent restocking fee) and a 90-day warranty.\nThere are many other options for refurbished tech, including Gazelle and Reebelo. Folks in the UK should try CeX.\nYou can find used electronics, sometimes for great prices, at charity stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, but many charities now sell the best electronics donations they receive through websites like eBay or pass them through third-party services that refurbish devices for them. If you’re having a rummage in store, make sure you ask if devices have been tested and see if you can try them before you buy, or at least return them for a refund if you take them home and find out they don’t work.\nYou'll get the best prices when you buy directly from other people, but those potential savings have to be balanced against the risks of getting a faulty device or being scammed. Marketplace websites that act as intermediaries for private sales offer some protection for buyers but also skim a fee from each sale, which can inflate prices slightly. While you can find bargains and reputable sellers, there is some risk, and support can prove disappointing and take a long time if you ever have to dispute something.\n- eBay: You can find everything on eBay, sellers have ratings, and there is some protection against scams. We have a detailed guide on how to buy used gear on eBay.\n- Swappa: Another marketplace that connects buyers and sellers for a small cut, Swappa focuses on electronics. It doesn’t allow broken gear, does some basic checks on some devices, and has people to review and approve listings.\n- Vinted: Originally for clothes, Vinted has expanded into electronics and connects buyers and sellers for a fee. It recently launched an Electronics Verification service so sellers can send devices in to be tested before they go to buyers. Sadly, it’s available only in the UK, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Poland, and Lithuania.\n- MPB: This company has specialists who vet the quality of used camera gear. Buyers get a six-month warranty.\nTo get the lowest possible prices, you could cut out the middlemen altogether and agree on a direct sale with a buyer, but this can be very risky, especially for electronics.\n- Craigslist: Simple, direct ads, but you'll have to arrange to meet the seller and usually pay in cash. The danger is that you have little or no recourse if the electronics you buy are faulty or stolen.\n- Gumtree: This is a popular Craigslist alternative in the UK that offers similar ads with buyers and sellers meeting directly and usually paying in cash.\n- Facebook Marketplace: Someone on Facebook Marketplace probably has exactly what you're looking for. Just be wary of scams, pick a public meetup spot like a park, and bring a friend if you're nervous.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Some sellers preferred used, pre-loved, secondhand, reconditioned—the list continues. Refurbishment implies that the seller has tested the device and maybe repaired and cleaned it, but the only way to be sure is to read the fine print and understand what the seller means by whatever term it is using.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">If you’re lucky, you may get an open-box device, which a buyer has opened but never actually used. Sellers are not legally allowed to resell returned devices as new, and it’s common for all returns to end up sold in the same place. At the other end of the scale, you may end up with a device that looks like it has survived the apocalypse and doesn’t work.</p><p id=\"tips-for-buying-refurbished\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Tips for Buying Refurbished</h2></p><p class=\"paywall\">I'll recommend a few good places to buy refurbished electronics below, but first let's explore what you should look for in a seller and what you need to do to protect yourself when you buy.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Aside from working out what the seller means by refurbished, you should read the listing for any potential purchase very carefully and try to answer questions such as these:</p><ul class=\"paywall\"><li>Has it been tested, and does everything work?</li><li>Does it have a new battery or a guarantee about battery health? (This is crucial for old phones and laptops.)</li><li>Has it been wiped if a previous user set it up?</li><li>Is there any cosmetic damage like scratches or cracks? (Look for a transparent grading system.)</li><li>What is included? (Does it come with chargers, cables, manuals, original packaging.)</li><li>Is there any warranty offered? (The longer the better.)</li><li>If there is a problem, how do returns work? Do you have to pay, and what is the window for a return?</li></ul><p class=\"paywall\">If you’re uncertain about anything, it’s worth asking before you buy to avoid disappointment.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Simon Hill</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">There are protections for purchases, such as Section 170 of the Fair Credit Billing Act in the US or <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/section75-protect-your-purchases/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/section75-protect-your-purchases/\" href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/reclaim/section75-protect-your-purchases/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Section 75</a> in the UK. But you should use a credit card for purchases to get the best charge-back protection and avoid <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/paypal-section75/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/paypal-section75/\" href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/paypal-section75/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">going through a third-party payment service</a>. Some banks and credit card companies are better than others, so it's worth researching their reputations and the protections they offer.</p><p class=\"paywall\">If you can inspect and test devices before you buy, do it. Otherwise you should closely examine and thoroughly test any device you buy immediately when you receive it. Remember that there is a limited window to report any faults or issues with the condition and return an item. Always keep the box and packaging it arrived in at least until you are satisfied that you won’t need to return it.</p><p id=\"best-places-to-buy-refurbished-electronics\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Best Places to Buy Refurbished Electronics</h2></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Simon Hill</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">You have an enormous choice when buying refurbished electronics, so let’s break down your options.</p><p class=\"paywall\">We have had some good experiences buying refurbished devices from their original manufacturers, which makes sense since they know precisely how to test and repair their own devices. All of these manufacturers certify the refurbished devices they sell, and most offer at least a one-year warranty, but the savings vary; for example, Apple offers up to 15 percent off, while Dell offers up to 50 percent off.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Simon Hill</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Many big retailers and carriers offer refurbished electronics, usually as a separate store, and there are bargains to be had.

    "content_text": "The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit on Monday against the US Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In its lawsuit, the ACLU accuses the agencies of violating the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) by ignoring the ACLU’s requests and subsequent appeals for information concerning the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) “attempted or actual access” to sensitive federal databases.\nThe ACLU began pursuing documents under the federal transparency law in February, as WIRED first reported, responding to reports that Elon Musk’s DOGE operatives were seeking access to troves of personal information belonging to US citizens, including US Department of Treasury records that contain “millions of Social Security numbers, bank accounts, business finances,” and more.\nOver the last few months, extensive reporting by WIRED and other outlets has exposed DOGE’s attempts to access and analyze sensitive data on federal employees, the American public, and immigrants to the US.\nIn its complaint, the ACLU argues that DOGE’s access to highly sensitive information about Americans’ health and finances raises “acute concerns” due to the “extraordinary harm” that can result from any unauthorized use of those files. According to the complaint, the ACLU pressed the SSA to expedite the release of public records associated with DOGE’s work; a process permitted when documents are deemed urgent to inform the public about government activities at the center of significant public debate or concern. The organization cited, among its other materials, a letter from Senator Mark Warner detailing the unprecedented secrecy shrouding DOGE’s activities.\nThe SSA rejected the ACLU’s claim but then later ignored its attempts to file an appeal, the ACLU says—a procedure the SSA is required to abide by under FOIA. The VA was even less responsive, the ACLU alleges; it acknowledged the ACLU’s request in February then ceased any further communications.\n“If DOGE is forcing its way into our private data, it is forcing itself into our private lives,” says Lauren Yu, one of the attorneys representing the ACLU in court. “Congress mandated strict privacy safeguards for a reason, and Americans deserve to know who has access to their social security numbers, their bank account information, and their health records … Government actors cannot continue to shroud themselves in secrecy while prying into our most sensitive records.”\nThe organization’s lawsuit is also informed, it says, by growing public concern over the ongoing push by DOGE to implement artificial intelligence (AI) systems, “which raises alarms about the potential for mass surveillance and politically motivated misuse of that deeply personal information.”\nEarlier this month, WIRED reported that a DOGE operative was attempting to use an AI tool to implement code at the VA, which administers benefits to roughly 10 million American veterans and their families, including health care and disability payments. Sources at the agency voiced concerns about the rush to implement AI, saying the operation had failed to follow normal procedures and threatened to put US veterans’ access to the benefits they’d earned at risk.\n“Granting DOGE access to VA data systems would not only violate federal law but it would undermine the very core of the VA mission to care for veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors,” Michelle Fraling, the ACLU’s counsel, said in a statement.\nWIRED reported last week that DOGE is knitting together data from the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Internal Revenue Service that could create a surveillance tool of unprecedented scope. The ACLU’s initial records requests were prompted in part by concerns, its FOIA filings say, about the use of computer matching programs that are able to cross-reference information on individuals using disparate government databases.\nThe ability of the government to cross-reference personal information using databases from different agencies is tightly regulated under the US Privacy Act. The act was amended in 1988 to require agencies to enter into written agreements before engaging in computer matching, and agencies are required under the law to calculate how such initiatives might impact individuals’ rights.\n“The federal government cannot dodge accountability by ignoring our lawful demands for transparency,” Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a statement.",

Learn more.\nCurious what happens to the power vacuum at the top of the Catholic Church once the pope dies?\nThe 2024 Oscar-winning film Conclave deals with that exact scenario. If you’re looking for a dramatized version of what the Catholic Church will be doing in wake of Pope Francis’ death at 88, you’d be hard pressed to find one more current. Just one problem: Due to the frustrating and fluid nature of content licensing, you can’t actually stream it via any subscription service right now.\nThe movie, which stars Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, and John Lithgow as cardinals all hiding dirty secrets while vying to be pope, was available to stream on Peacock until very recently. Thanks to a deal between Universal and Amazon Prime Video, though, the title is moving to Prime video—a transition that was in progress right as news of Pope Francis’ passing came out on Monday. Currently, you can rent the film for between $6 and $20 on Prime, or you can wait until 3 am Eastern time on Tuesday to watch it on the service for free if you’re a Prime member.\nThe deal, signed in 2021, means that following their theatrical releases, Universal Filmed Entertainment Group movies head to Peacock for four months before switching to Prime Video for 10 months, then migrating back to Peacock for the last four months of the “Pay-One” window—the period that follows a theater release. WIRED has reached out to Amazon to confirm Conclave will stream starting Tuesday and will update this post if we receive a response.\nMeanwhile, Bluesky, X, and TikTok are overflowing with bits about the movie—including jokes about how Pope Francis died soon after meeting US vice president JD Vance—and how a real-life conclave could work.\nThe timing of the Conclave movie shuffle to coincide with the incredibly rare historical event of a Catholic pope dying is an extreme example of the perpetual game of whack-a-mole viewers are subjected to when it comes to streaming deals. Sometimes, no matter how many services we’re subscribed to, we still can’t watch what we want when we want it.\nConclave is a beautifully shot and spicy take on the church’s highest ranking clergy going through the highly secretive and ancient ritual of selecting a new pope, a period known as sede vacante. But it’s not the only good papal content out there.\nSo if you’re looking to scratch the itch with something that’s available to stream now, here are a couple of other options:\nThe Two Popes (Netflix, 2019)\nStreaming on Netflix, The Two Popes stars Anthony Hopkins as Pope Benedict XVI and follows his friendship with his eventual successor, Pope Francis. It’s inspired by their real-life relationship.\nThe Young Pope (Max, 2016)\nStarring Jude Law as the world’s first American pope, this 10-episode miniseries focuses on a pope who bucks conventions and eschews the advice of Vatican stalwarts in favor of the guidance of Sister Mary, an American nun played by Diane Keaton.\nThe New Pope (Max, 2020)\nThe New Pope picks up where The Young Pope leaves off, with Jude Law’s Pope Pius XIII comatose as the succession race creates turmoil and reveals scandal after scandal.",

Just one problem: Due to the frustrating and fluid nature of content licensing, you can’t actually stream it via any subscription service right now.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The movie, which stars <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=955177219d80cd60&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1154US1154&amp;q=Ralph+Fiennes&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLVT9c3NMy2LK4yTq7KVeLUz9U3MDQ3KEzTEspOttJPy8zJBRNWyYnFJYtYeYMScwoyFNwyU_PyUosBU-2cN0AAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwis97Xvs-mMAxWaFlkFHdDcHu8Q9OUBegQIFBAC\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ralph Fiennes</a>, Stanley Tucci, and John Lithgow as cardinals all hiding dirty secrets while vying to be pope, was available to stream on Peacock until very recently. Thanks to a deal between Universal and Amazon Prime Video, though, the title is moving to Prime video—a transition that was in progress right as news of Pope Francis’ passing came out on Monday. Currently, you can rent the film for between $6 and $20 on Prime, or you can wait until 3 am Eastern time on Tuesday to watch it on the service for free if you’re a Prime member.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">The deal, signed in 2021, means that following their theatrical releases, Universal Filmed Entertainment Group movies head to Peacock for four months before switching to Prime Video for 10 months, then migrating back to Peacock for the last four months of the “Pay-One” window—the period that follows a theater release.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nSometimes regular underthings just don’t cut it. That’s where the best shapewear comes in. Whether you’re trying to accentuate your curves or wear a certain type of clothing to an event, shapewear can help your clothes look the way you want them to. Nothing’s wrong with your body, no matter what it looks like. But if you’re trying to create a specific look, shapewear is what you want. I’ve spent months testing shaping shorts, bodysuits, underwear, and more to find the best options on the market. Below, you’ll find my top picks, like the Honeylove Cami Bodysuit ($90), which is perfect for special events.\nBe sure to check out our other related buying guides, including the Best Hoodies, Best Leggings, and Best T-Shirts.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nHow We Tested and What’s Up Next\nI usually wear a 10 or 12 pant size, and during my initial testing period I gained muscle and lost weight. I wore every piece at least twice, both around the house and out and about running errands or attending events. I made sure to bend over, stretch, squat, use the bathroom, sit down, walk around, take them on and off, attach and adjust any straps, and generally wear the pieces as I would in my daily life. I checked for comfort, stretching, whether the pieces rode up, rolled, or slid down, whether they were easy to breathe in, and what the silhouette of applicable pieces looked like under a tight slip dress. Next up I’ll be testing more brands, including Spanx, Skims, Victoria’s Secret, and some affordable options from Amazon.\nBefore You Shop\nIt’s ideal to measure your body before doing any online clothes shopping, but it’s especially important when it comes to shapewear. Get yourself a soft measuring tape and take careful measurements. Double-check reviews to see whether something runs true to size before purchasing. Some manufacturers have sizing recommendations, too. And if you’re ordering something for a special event, give yourself plenty of time to allow for potential returns or exchanges.\nShapewear We Didn’t Love\nYummie Ultralight Shaping Short for $20: Unfortunately, these shorts could not contain my booty. And not in a way that was voluptuous and like my cup runneth over—more so in a way that made me feel like a wad of meat constricted into a tube. (Which I suppose I was.) They’re not high-waisted enough for me, and while the grippy tape at the bottom of the shorts helped prevent them from rolling up, they also cut my quads off in an unflattering way. And the top tended to roll down whenever I sat. They did take an inch off all around, but it was at the expense of my comfort—I felt like I had to constantly readjust them.\nKnix Shaper Open-Bust Customizable Bodysuit for $90: I really like the idea of this bodysuit. Using sharp scissors, you can cut along the flocked guidelines to change the hemline and neckline, allowing for a custom fit with a lower back or higher shorts than the default. Unfortunately, it was really difficult—nearly impossible, actually—to squeeze myself into this suit, even though I ordered according to my measurements, and even after I washed it and let it air dry. I also don’t love that the crotch is closed, which means you’d have to peel yourself out of the bodysuit whenever you use the bathroom. Additionally, if you don’t cut to the lowest backline (or highest hemline), the cut guidelines can be visible under clothing. There are just too many other great bodysuits on the market for me to recommend this one.",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE UnifiedProductCardDescriptionWrapper-dyAmCu deqABF fxYvgV ikCgap\"><div><p>As with the other Knix shapewear I tried, I had to fight like hell to get into these shorts. I was praying to my ancestors that I wouldn’t get stuck in them. But once I finagled them up my body the first time, they stretched out a bit, and they also lost a bit of compression after washing them, which made them feel less constricting (but still structured). The shorts do a great job at compressing my tummy, back, and thighs, and they’re high-waisted, which nips in my waist without creating a bulge at the top. The “3D Fabric technology” is really just flocked strips on the rear end. The strips frame the top and bottom of your butt, which help to lift it up and and push it out a tad. Basically, they make your butt look good. The waistband has an extra strip of elastic that helps prevent it from rolling down. These didn’t roll down on me, but that tight waistband might create a love-handle effect, depending on how long your torso is and how tight your bra is.</p><p>They do have a side seam, but it’s nearly invisible, even under a tight slip dress. These shorts have PerfectCut technology, which means they can be cut shorter by using sharp scissors along the marked, flocked lines on the inside. It lets you adjust the length without needing to worry about fraying or losing compression. Note that if you don’t cut the shorts, the inside flocked lines might be noticeable if you’re wearing a super-tight, thigh-hugging garment on top. I do wish the shorts had a double gusset, but they’re not too difficult to take on or off after the first couple of wears. These also have the option to choose Knix’s leakproof fabric along the crotch, which helps to absorb leaks and sweat. You can choose Moderate absorption, which absorbs about 1.5 regular tampons’ worth of fluid, or Essential which is not leakproof. (I’ve tested Knix period underwear for a separate, upcoming guide, and I can confirm that Moderate absorption does well to absorb leaks, but I’d still recommend wearing a tampon if you’re early on in your cycle and wearing these out and about.)</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sizes</strong></td><td>XS to 4X</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Colors</strong></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Compression level</strong></td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fabric details</strong></td><td>Body: Lycra Xtra Life Spandex, NylonGusset: Cotton, Spandex, Carbon (Gusset composition changes based on chosen absorption level)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "An early February 2024 game between English Premier League contenders Liverpool and Arsenal was set to be a vital clash that would help determine the eventual league champion. Liverpool held a narrow lead in the league, but an Arsenal victory would draw them within just two points of overtaking their rivals in the standings.\nI was lucky enough to be watching this vital match up close and decided to brag a bit: I texted a friend, a keen EPL fan, with a couple pictures of my pitch-side view. He was jealous, naturally, and also probably a bit confused at why a limited soccer fan like myself would be flying thousands of miles from my home in the western US all the way to the UK to watch a match between two clubs I have no connection to.\nBut it was a ruse!\nI wasn’t across the pond, even if the pics I sent my buddy sure looked like it. I was just 20 minutes from my home in Salt Lake City at the Cosm Experience Center, a facility on the University of Utah campus with a 65-foot, 8K screen. The game didn’t just look real from pictures; it felt real for large chunks of the livestream, with the massive wraparound screen and thumping spatial audio system providing sights and sounds that truly made me feel like I was in the stadium.\nMy silly little trick isn’t remotely novel, whether at this smaller SLC venue or one of Cosm’s two larger locations in Los Angeles and Dallas, where the company showcases its “shared reality” immersive experiences. Cosm reps tell me people take photos of the screen all the time, searching for some way to adequately capture the feeling of being at one of the broadcasts. Like The Sphere, the wildly popular venue in Las Vegas, it’s a jolt to feel such realism from digital displays—and to experience the roar of the crowd and a communal experience that’s a far cry from simply watching the game at home.\nCosm represents a growing trend in live sports experiences. The company made headlines when tickets for game 1 of the Yankees-Dodgers matchup in the 2024 World Series at its LA facility sold out in just seven minutes. Now the company is pioneering first-of-their-kind broadcasts across other leagues, including the NBA, NHL, and UFC.\nI recently went back to the SLC facility for another demo. What I saw was a window into an immersive future—in sports, entertainment, and education—which can be accessed through any screen, from a towering Cosm dome to the phone in your pocket.\nGame On\nCosm’s history is fascinating, and it touches on the earliest days of immersive projection systems.\nThe company’s roots in immersive tech date back decades, when said tech was pioneered for planetariums. The Cosm brand was born in 2020 when a leader in planetarium projection technology partnered with major entities in computer graphics and virtual reality. The name Cosm is derived from the collision of the Colosseum and the Cosmos.\nCosm proved its abilities in the immersive space through streaming feeds for VR coverage of the 2022 Olympic Winter Games and the 2022 FIFA World Cup, then opened its first official venues with large screens in LA and Dallas in 2024.\nThose venues hold around 1,400 people, according to Cosm; the SLC venue I visited is much smaller, but has a similar setup. A lobby with huge LED screens welcomes visitors; classic stadium concessions are readily available, including seat-side delivery; like a real arena, seating is split into multiple levels.\nOnce I got inside, in front of me was that massive 8K screen—other Cosm venues use screens with even higher resolutions, including up to 12K—that took up my entire field of view and then some, wrapping around the sides of the venue and up over my head. The picture quality was insane; Cosm tells me its venues are the first true “black domes” in the industry, a design which minimizes issues like cross-reflection (an effect where light bounces off a display’s surface in unpredictable ways, causing diminished clarity and brightness) and allows for incredibly rich visuals. When combined with the use of high-quality LED lights for the actual displays, the resulting visuals are breathtaking.\n“The system contrast is 10 times that of what you can achieve with any projector,” Cosm chief operations officer Kirk Johnson tells me.\nFor sound, Cosm uses an array of speakers—16 speakers plus four subwoofers at the SLC facility; 38 speakers and 15 subwoofers at the LA and Dallas locations—affixed at various points directly behind the LED displays, which are permeable to allow sound through them. This allows Cosm to make noises and effects sound like they’re coming from any part of the room, even seemingly behind me.\nOn the sports side, both the NBA (Cosm’s first league partner) and NHL experiences are amazing. Cosm can put you courtside for NBA games, both at center court and on either baseline. The NHL program feels a touch more immersive than that, even, particularly a corner view that’s technically from outside the glass, but truly makes you feel like you’re standing on the rink itself.\nUFC was another highlight. Cosm’s standard UFC viewing angle is a perch just above the octagon, as if you were sitting on a magic carpet hovering a few feet off the ground; it’s a far better view than I’ve ever seen on a UFC pay-per-view. “We had a few fights where there was blood on the lenses,” Cosm president and CEO Jeb Terry tells me.\nThere are other views for UFC events as well, including octagon-side. Between bouts, it pans back to a wide shot in the stands.\n“I feel like I have a seat in the crowd,” says Alon Cohen, UFC senior VP of research and development, of what it’s like to watch a match at a Cosm venue. “It gives you a different experience than if you put on a set of VR glasses. It gives you a different experience than going to a Sphere where everything’s so big.”\nWhile the Sphere comparison is unavoidable at first, Cosm doesn’t really consider the concert venue a competitor. They do such different things, even if both are enabled by incredible visual technology. “We both believe in an amazing human experience powered by technology, something that will wow you,” Terry says.\nThe non-sports experiences I sat through were just as impressive, including beautiful views of a performance of Cirque du Soleil’s “O” stage show. Maybe most impressive, though, was Cosm’s suite of tools that straddle between the worlds of entertainment and education.\nFirst, Cosm brought me inside a true-life rendering of the Sistine Chapel. An engineer floated around the chapel using nothing but an Xbox controller; it felt like I was inside a drone flying around the room.\nCosm then showed me a bird’s-eye rendering of the building we were sitting in and its surroundings; think Google Maps, but on steroids. From there, the view zoomed out as we were transported several hundred miles to the LA Cosm facility, with every inch of earth between the two locations mapped on the screen. We then zoomed out even further to see the entire country, then the entire world, the entire galaxy, and the entire known universe.\nAll of this is brought to life on Cosm’s giant screen using a software platform called Digistar. It was originally developed to power computer graphics projections for planetariums in the 1980s and has evolved into a fully modern digital animation platform. (The company that developed Digistar is one of the handful that merged in 2021 to form Cosm.)\nThe system engineers tell me the Digistar software accurately maps every piece of space debris over one meter in size, including billions of stars and data points. Cosm folks tell me kids love this exercise of flying around the universe; it left my head spinning a bit.\nWith many of Cosm’s main offerings, sports especially, it’s about more than just the graphics and the visual quality. It’s the communal experience. The Cosm folks tell me that if the crowd in an actual arena is doing the wave during one of the livestreamed games, fans inside the Cosm venue will join in as it reaches their section. When a UFC fight ends in a knockout, everyone jumps out of their seat like they would if they were actually there.\n“You feel like you’re in this space with people where that’s the appropriate reaction,” Cohen says. “The reactions you [get in Cosm] are the reactions you get in the arena.”\nThe actual Cosm facilities, however, are just one piece of the company’s overall role in the immersive space. The company hopes to eventually get its flavor of content into other facilities and onto other platforms.\nEven as it has expanded into sports and other forms of entertainment, Cosm has maintained a strong foothold in planetariums and similar educational venues. Europe’s first ever LED dome, the Prague Planetarium, integrates Cosm’s CX System backend technology. The company has been involved with facilities like the Arizona Science Center, the MOSI Saunders Planetarium in Tampa Bay, Florida, and the Shanghai Astronomy Museum. Cosm’s tech powers over 700 planetariums around the world.\nAmong its most recent ventures was at the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, where in December 2024 Cosm helped convert the Texas museum’s decommissioned Omni IMAX theater into a 360-degree immersive dome, complete with 12,000 LED panels. This dome hosts all sorts of content, from Cosm-produced films to various educational programs for all ages; that same zoom-out-to-the-entire-universe feature I saw at my demo is a regular part of programming, for instance.\n“It doesn’t just function as a regular screen. It can sort of be anything and do anything,” says Nikki Diller, VP of collections, interpretations, and programs for the museum. “People say the sky is the limit. I say the known universe is the limit, because that’s part of what our planetarium software can do.”\nLike many other entities using the tech, the Fort Worth Museum is still figuring out the best ways to bring it to new audiences. The museum and various other Cosm partners have tried a number of approaches, from live orchestra performances to trivia and karaoke.\nCosm has also positioned itself as a central hub in the growing immersive entertainment space, one that some refer to broadly as “180 video”—a bit of a misnomer, as many of Cosm’s programs take up much more than 180 degrees in the field of view.

Learn more.\nThe advent of mouse controls on the Nintendo Switch 2 has been a veritable saga. Despite being long rumored, the feature didn't get so much as a mention when Nintendo officially announced the new console in January 2025, only being confirmed in April's full reveal.\nWith a sensor built into both the left and right Joy-Con 2 controllers, either can be rotated 90 degrees on its Y axis to use as a mouse, while retaining gyroscopic, motion-sensing, and haptic capabilities. It's a smart addition on Nintendo's part, opening up the new hardware for more diverse gaming experiences than consoles typically offer. There's only one problem: They hurt.\nAttending the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in London, I was excited to get my hands on the new console in all its forms, and I was left impressed. In handheld mode, the bigger 7.9-inch screen looks gorgeous thanks to its higher 1080p resolution and use of HDR, almost good enough to forgive the shift back to LCD from OLED.\nPlayed in docked mode, output to 4K TVs, Mario Kart World dazzled, showcasing a richly detailed cartoon world with astonishing verticality—race off the edge of the track in its open world, fall what feels like miles, and there’s simply more world to continue karting around.\nI was most interested in those new mouse controls, though, so I zeroed in on any games where WIRED could try them out. What I found was a host of titles that positively sparkled with Nintendo's trademark charm. In particular, futuristic wheelchair basketball outing Drag X Drive feels like the new-gen console's answer to ARMS, being a game designed around showing off the underlying tech.\nNoticeable Aching, Uncomfortable Twinges\nIt does a pretty solid job on that front, using both Joy-Con 2s in mouse mode to play. Push one Joy-Con 2 forward and you'll rotate that side’s wheel in-game to turn; thrust both forward and you'll race forward. Grab the ball and raise a Joy-Con into the air, and you physically throw the ball to attempt to score. It's intuitive, and the speedy 3-on-3 match format makes this a fun multiplayer outing that's sure to find a niche, but wildly sliding two makeshift mice around a desk also left both my forearms noticeably aching.\nMetroid Prime 4: Beyond wasn't as intense, but controls took a little getting used to. The long-awaited sequel to the Wii trilogy uses console-style thumbstick movement controls on the left-hand Joy-Con 2, while the right-hand one can be used more like a PC mouse to govern aiming, firing, and protagonist Samus' Morph Ball transformations. It's a halfway house between joypad and mouse-and-keyboard controls that felt odd, but it gelled pretty quickly, and I took down the demo's boss first time. Again, though, I felt uncomfortable twinges afterward, especially in my right arm.\nOther titles including Super Mario Party Jamboree and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour give some smart demos of the mouse tech—the latter combines the Joy-Con 2’s gyroscopic and rumble features with the mouse sensor to test players' sense of where vibration feels strongest along a line, for example—but one of the best uses I discovered was on Square Enix's Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster.\nThe upgraded RPG packs in two chunky side games dedicated to mouse controls, “Luxencheer Rhythm Catch” and “Ringabel's Panic Cruise!” The former is a beat-matching music game, using both Joy-Con 2s in mouse mode to catch notes as they appear, while the latter sees you piloting a steampunk airship, using the mice to steer, pull levers, and conduct repairs in real time. Both make exceptional uses of the tech, almost feeling like full games in their own right.\nSuch original approaches to mouse controls could be Nintendo's secret weapon on the Switch 2, and developers are already coming up with more inventive uses for the tech than simply bringing a cursor to console gaming.\nMake no mistake, everything I played beautifully captured Nintendo's “play comes first” ethos. The problem was the physical toll that came afterward. Drag X Drive might be the main culprit, but after almost four hours of testing various Switch 2 games with these newfangled mouse controls, my wrists were practically screaming.\nErgonomic Error\nI lay the blame solely on the design. When paired with a frame as a single joypad or used as individual, motion-sensing grips, the Joy-Con 2s are as comfortable as their predecessors were on the Switch 1—possibly a little more so, thanks to slightly larger, more substantial thumbsticks. Use them as mice, though, and you're suddenly trying to guide a pair of plastic daggers around, holding the knife's edge.\nWhen you look at some of the best gaming mice around, a common factor tends to be a focus on ergonomics. Some might offer better support than others or have a more natural resting spot for thumbs, but to greater or lesser extents, a good mouse is sculpted to fit the arch of the typical human hand.\nIn contrast, the Joy-Con 2s in mouse mode offer a thin, flat wedge, simultaneously not giving enough purchase where you need it and digging into your palm where you don't want it. The thinness also means that fingers are cramped too closely together, hovering over each Joy-Con's shoulder buttons and triggers as ersatz left and right mouse buttons but lacking enough clearance to use either properly. I often felt like I was forcing my hand into a raised-claw-like grip, too high and arched, and nowhere to put my ring and little fingers. Ouch.\nWhile the versatility of the Joy-Con 2s is amazing, it's just not comfortable to use them as mice for longer periods of play. So, if Nintendo wants mouse controls on the Switch 2 to be anything more than a gimmick in the long term, it needs to do one thing: release a \"Mouse Pro.”\nMouse Pro Is the Way to Go\nI don't mean a way to use a regular mouse on Switch 2, either by connecting one to the Switch 2's upper USB-C port or pairing one wirelessly. That might just work for something like Metroid Prime 4, but it would still lack the hardware-specific inputs of the Switch 2, like the new C button that activates in-game chat features. No, for anything using both Joy-Con 2s as mice at once, like those wonderful Bravely Default mini-games, a retail standard mouse—or even two—wouldn't work at all.\nInstead, Nintendo needs to cram all the impressive bits of the Joy-Cons—the motion sensing gyroscopes, the satisfying haptic motors, and of course the sensors that enable mouse functions—into actual mouse-shaped mice. Mice that fit into your hands and offer spaced-out, reachable buttons. Mice that don't physically hurt to hold after half an hour of gaming.\nAny hypothetical Mouse Pro would need to be two to maintain compatibility with games using both at once. Release a paired bundle—Joy-Mouse L and Joy-Mouse R, anyone?—and Drag X Drive is suddenly viable as a competitive esport.\nIt's not that far-fetched an idea either—Nintendo has already released a mouse for its consoles before, with the SNES Mouse from 33 years ago. While never a must-have, it was a sleeper hit, with almost 100 games supporting it to varying degrees. That was a basic point-and-click tool, too. A modern update retaining all the features of the Joy-Con 2s, but in a dedicated mouse form, could be even more successful.\nThere are problems with the idea, though. Specific mice might have limited utility—we still don't know how many Switch 2 games will adopt dual-mouse controls, or how fully. Some games may require shifting between different control styles, with the likes of (the lengthily-titled) Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV putting the Joy-Con 2s through their paces in just about every use-case scenario they're capable of. A \"Mouse Pro\" simply wouldn't be viable for anything that only briefly swaps to mouse controls.\nHowever, a potentially high price might be the toughest hurdle to overcome. The $450 (£389) MSRP for the base Switch 2 console has already been controversial, as have game prices of up to $80 or £75. Some accessories have already jumped in price slightly due to Trump's tariffs, like the Switch 2 Pro Controller jumping from $80 to $85.\nThe Joy Con 2s themselves now cost $95 (previously $90) a pair, so we'd have to assume a dual pack of ergonomic mice built around the same proprietary technology would likely be even more expensive. If mouse features prove to have minimal presence on Switch 2 games, then a pricey peripheral built around them is a nonstarter.\nIf that turns out to be the case, I'd settle for some sort of outer brace to clip onto the Joy-Con 2s—a mouse-shaped shell that would make using the controllers as mice more viable. Third-party accessory companies could even step up here.\nWhatever happens, if Nintendo wants mouse controls on Switch 2 to ever be more than a curiosity, it needs to do something to take the almost literal sting out of using them. If it doesn't, the feature is likely to go the way of the IR sensor on the original Switch—an interesting idea, soon abandoned.",

    "content_text": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nAt the beginning of time and the center of every black hole lies a point of infinite density called a singularity. To explore these enigmas, we take what we know about space, time, gravity, and quantum mechanics and apply it to a place where all of those things simply break down. There is, perhaps, nothing in the universe that challenges the imagination more. Physicists still believe that if they can come up with a coherent explanation for what actually happens in and around singularities, something revelatory will emerge, perhaps a new understanding of what space and time are made of.\nIn the late 1960s, some physicists speculated that singularities might be surrounded by a region of churning chaos, where space and time haphazardly grow and shrink. Charles Misner of the University of Maryland called it a “Mixmaster universe,” after what was then a popular line of kitchen appliances. If an astronaut were to fall into a black hole, “one can imagine it mixing up the astronaut’s body parts in the way that a mixmaster or eggbeater mixes up the yolk and white of an egg,” Kip Thorne, a Nobel Prize–winning physicist, later wrote.\nEinstein’s general theory of relativity, which is used to describe the gravity of black holes, uses a single field equation to explain how space curves and matter moves. But that equation uses a mathematical shorthand called a tensor to hide 16 distinct, intertwined equations. Several scientists, including Misner, had devised useful simplifying assumptions to let them explore scenarios like the Mixmaster universe.\nWithout those assumptions, Einstein’s equation couldn’t be solved analytically, and even with them it was too complicated for the numerical simulations of the time. Like the appliance they were named after, these ideas fell out of style. These “dynamics are supposed to be a very general phenomenon in gravity,” said Gerben Oling, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh. “But it’s something that fell off the map.”\nIn the last few years, physicists have been revisiting the chaos around singularities with new mathematical tools. Their goals are twofold. One hope is to show that approximations that Misner and others made are valid approximations of Einsteinian gravity. The other is to push closer to singularities in the hope that their extremes will help reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics in a theory of quantum gravity, which has been a goal of physicists for over a century. As Sean Hartnoll of the University of Cambridge put it, “The time is ripe now for these ideas to be fully developed.”\nThe Birth of Mixmaster Chaos\nThorne described the late ’60s as a “golden age” for black hole research. The term “black hole” had only just come into widespread use. In September 1969, on a visit to Moscow, Thorne was given a manuscript by Evgeny Lifshitz, a prominent Ukrainian physicist. Together with Vladimir Belinski and Isaak Khalatnikov, Lifschitz had found a new solution to Einstein’s equations of gravity near a singularity, using assumptions the three of them had devised. Lifshitz was afraid Soviet censors would delay publication of the result, since it contradicted an earlier proof he had coauthored, so he asked Thorne to share it in the West.\nEarlier black hole models assumed perfect symmetries not found in nature, positing, for example, that a star was a perfect sphere before collapsing into a black hole, or that it had no net electrical charge. (These assumptions allowed Einstein’s equations to be solved, in the simplest form, by Karl Schwarzschild shortly after Einstein published them.) The solution that Belinski, Khalatnikov, and Lifschitz found, which came to be called the BKL solution after their initials, described what might happen in a messy, more realistic situation where black holes form from irregularly shaped objects. The result was not a smooth stretching of space and time inside, but a roiling sea of space and time stretching and compressing in multiple directions.\nThorne smuggled the paper back to the United States and mailed a copy to Misner, who he knew was thinking along similar lines. It turned out that Misner and the Soviet group had independently alighted on the same ideas using similar assumptions and different techniques. What’s more, the BKL group “used it to solve the biggest unsolved problem of that era in mathematical relativity,” Thorne said, concerning the existence of what is known as a “generic” singularity. Belinski, the last surviving member of the BKL trio, recently said in an email that Misner’s vivid descriptions in turn helped him to visualize the chaotic situation near the singularities that they both revealed.\nUnderstanding some of what they were uncovering requires grasping the ways that general relativity and quantum mechanics are at odds with each other. Notably, relativity posits that spacetime must be continuous: You can look at arbitrarily small distances and never find a gap in it. In quantum mechanics, however, it becomes meaningless to talk about distances smaller than a limit called the Planck length—beyond that, we can’t know that there are no gaps in space-time. But the two theories have one commonality. Both are profoundly counterintuitive.\nRelativity holds that two regions of space can be disconnected, meaning that nothing that takes place in one region can have any possible effect on the other. This might simply be because they are far apart—the speed of light is finite, after all. But regions of spacetime can also become disconnected, or decoupled, in the presence of strong gravitational fields, such as those found in and around a black hole. These fields slow down the flow of time so much that interaction becomes impossible. For example, the inside and outside of a black hole are decoupled by a boundary called the event horizon. Because black hole gravity is so strong, anything that takes place within the event horizon can’t ever be observed from outside the black hole, according to relativity. (Quantum mechanics introduces additional complications.)\nBecause strong gravitational fields can cause space to decouple, the BKL group argued that, as you get close to a singularity, the strong gravity causes every point in space to decouple from every other one. This means that each tiny part of space behaves on its own terms, and it makes the math much simpler (though still quite complicated). If decoupling takes place, they showed that the inside of a black hole is a mishmash—rather unlike the smooth stretching of space and time that Schwarzschild’s earlier solution suggested. As Hartnoll explained, though the BKL argument wasn’t fully rigorous by mathematical standards, until they advanced the idea, nobody had anticipated that decoupling occurs. BKL, he said, were way ahead of their time.\nIn their account, around each decoupled point, space stretches in a random direction and compresses in the other two perpendicular directions. Then, after a short but random amount of time, it flips, stretching out in one of the previously squished directions and squishing in the other two. This can be thought of like an extremely elongated football that keeps “bouncing” between different orientations.\nFor decades, physicists and mathematicians have wanted to show that these chaotic dynamics are not an artifact of the simplifying assumption of decoupling, but inherent to black holes. By the early 2000s, exponentially growing computational power and new algorithms made it possible to perform numerical simulations that were consistent with decoupling. Around the same time, Marc Henneaux, Thibault Damour and Hermann Nicolai proved the existence of a number of intricate symmetries near a singularity, without assuming that decoupling must occur. Since then, physicists and mathematicians have been working to establish when chaos appears near a singularity, and figure out what more can be said about singularities themselves.\nA Simplifying Hologram\nIn 1997, Juan Maldacena, a physicist now at the Institute for Advanced Study, discovered a correspondence, known as AdS/CFT, between two different versions of spacetime: a higher-dimensional spacetime called the bulk and a lower-dimensional spacetime called the boundary. This correspondence is often compared to the way a hologram can make two-dimensional structures appear to be three-dimensional. Also called duality, it means that solutions arrived at in one of two simplified toy universes also apply to the other.\nGravity only appears on the higher-dimensional side of the correspondence, called anti-de Sitter space, or AdS. On the boundary side, there is no gravity. Interactions between particles there are governed only by a version of quantum mechanics called conformal field theory, or CFT. One can use AdS/CFT to pose a complex problem on one side, translate it into a simpler form on the other, and translate a solution back—an extremely powerful tool for physicists seeking to understand gravitational phenomena such as black holes. (Some problems are easier on the AdS side, while others are easier on the CFT side.)\nIn 2019 Hartnoll, then a professor at Stanford, together with his students, set out to use the correspondence to find out what happens inside an AdS black hole. “The reason we wanted to do this,” Hartnoll said, “is to relate the black hole interior, which isn’t well understood, with the region far away, which is well understood.” They found chaos similar to that BKL had earlier discovered. Over the past half-decade, he and his collaborators have continued to use the correspondence to analyze black hole dynamics.\nAfter Hartnoll first found BKL-like chaos in AdS/CFT, others have been trying to figure out what, exactly, causes it to arise. Oling says that Hartnoll’s discovery of the Mixmaster in AdS/CFT black holes came as a surprise. Hartnoll’s team “discovered that this behavior appears in settings where they would have not expected it,” he said. Together with Juan Pedraza of the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Madrid, Oling has shown that it arises even in a toy AdS/CFT model where the speed of light is set to zero. Oling said that Henneaux, among others, had anticipated that this should happen, but that the proof wasn’t a given. “To me, that’s not obvious,” Oling said, “because you’re really simplifying the theory a lot.” In parallel, mathematicians have been approaching the BKL-like chaos from their own direction by whittling away at the assumptions required to prove that chaos emerges, and checking if it must arise even without the decoupling assumption.\nAs might be expected, modeling chaotic and unpredictable bounces in spacetime is a challenge. Most recently, Hartnoll and his student Ming Yang tried averaging the many bounces in a black hole. In a preprint they shared on February 4, 2025, they found a pattern using this technique related to abstract mathematical functions called modular forms. This suggests that a known mathematical language can be used to understand the chaos. “These patterns may indicate an underlying hidden structure of gravity,” Hartnoll said. “That may make it easier to formulate a quantum theory of gravity.” Even if the event horizon prevents us from directly observing the chaos inside black holes, knowing it is there and what it means could point the way to a new physics, and toward answers to some of our grandest questions about reality itself.\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

To explore these enigmas, we take what we know about space, time, gravity, and quantum mechanics and apply it to a place where all of those things simply break down. There is, perhaps, nothing in the universe that challenges the imagination more. Physicists still believe that if they can come up with a coherent explanation for what actually happens in and around singularities, something revelatory will emerge, perhaps <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unraveling-of-space-time-20240925/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a new understanding of what space and time are made of</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">In the late 1960s, some physicists speculated that singularities might be surrounded by a region of churning chaos, where space and time haphazardly grow and shrink. Charles Misner of the University of Maryland called it a “Mixmaster universe,” after what was then a <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.decodan.com/sunbeam-id\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.decodan.com/sunbeam-id\" href=\"https://www.decodan.com/sunbeam-id\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">popular line of kitchen appliances</a>. If an astronaut were to fall into a black hole, “one can imagine it mixing up the astronaut’s body parts in the way that a mixmaster or eggbeater mixes up the yolk and white of an egg,” <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://pma.caltech.edu/people/kip-s-thorne\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://pma.caltech.edu/people/kip-s-thorne\" href=\"https://pma.caltech.edu/people/kip-s-thorne\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kip Thorne</a>, a Nobel Prize–winning physicist, later wrote.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which is used to describe the gravity of black holes, uses a single field equation to explain how space curves and matter moves. But that equation uses a <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-geometric-tool-that-solved-einsteins-relativity-problem-20240812/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mathematical shorthand called a tensor</a> to hide 16 distinct, intertwined equations. Several scientists, including Misner, had devised useful simplifying assumptions to let them explore scenarios like the Mixmaster universe.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Without those assumptions, Einstein’s equation couldn’t be solved analytically, and even with them it was too complicated for the numerical simulations of the time. Like the appliance they were named after, these ideas fell out of style. These “dynamics are supposed to be a very general phenomenon in gravity,” said <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://gerbenoling.nl/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://gerbenoling.nl/\" href=\"https://gerbenoling.nl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gerben Oling</a>, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh. “But it’s something that fell off the map.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">In the last few years, physicists have been revisiting the chaos around singularities with new mathematical tools. Their goals are twofold. One hope is to show that approximations that Misner and others made are valid approximations of Einsteinian gravity. The other is to push closer to singularities in the hope that their extremes will help reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics in a theory of quantum gravity, which has been a goal of physicists for over a century. As <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/person/sah40\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/person/sah40\" href=\"https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/person/sah40\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Hartnoll</a> of the University of Cambridge put it, “The time is ripe now for these ideas to be fully developed.”</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">The Birth of Mixmaster Chaos</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Thorne described the late ’60s as a “golden age” for black hole research. The term “black hole” had only just come into widespread use. In September 1969, on a visit to Moscow, Thorne was given a manuscript by Evgeny Lifshitz, a prominent Ukrainian physicist. Together with <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.icra.it/People/Belinski.htm\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.icra.it/People/Belinski.htm\" href=\"https://www.icra.it/People/Belinski.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vladimir Belinski</a> and Isaak Khalatnikov, Lifschitz had found a new solution to Einstein’s equations of gravity near a singularity, using assumptions the three of them had devised. Lifshitz was afraid Soviet censors would delay publication of the result, since it contradicted an earlier proof he had coauthored, so he asked Thorne to share it in the West.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Earlier black hole models assumed perfect symmetries not found in nature, positing, for example, that a star was a perfect sphere before collapsing into a black hole, or that it had no net electrical charge. (These assumptions allowed Einstein’s equations to be solved, in the simplest form, by <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/black-hole-singularities-are-as-inescapable-as-expected-20191202/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Karl Schwarzschild</a> shortly after Einstein published them.) The solution that Belinski, Khalatnikov, and Lifschitz found, which came to be called the BKL solution after their initials, described what might happen in a messy, more realistic situation where black holes form from irregularly shaped objects. The result was not a smooth stretching of space and time inside, but a roiling sea of space and time stretching and compressing in multiple directions.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Thorne smuggled the paper back to the United States and mailed a copy to Misner, who he knew was thinking along similar lines. It turned out that Misner and the Soviet group had independently alighted on the same ideas using similar assumptions and different techniques. What’s more, the BKL group “used it to solve the biggest unsolved problem of that era in mathematical relativity,” Thorne said, concerning the existence of what is known as a “generic” singularity. Belinski, the last surviving member of the BKL trio, recently said in an email that Misner’s vivid descriptions in turn helped him to visualize the chaotic situation near the singularities that they both revealed.</p></div></div></body></html>",

No surprise there, yet I frequently get that FOMO-y feeling that something new or different might be better than what I own.\nSeveral months ago, I looked at a set of carbon steel knives made in Oregon by Steelport. They were beautiful, with their blade patina and sculptural wood handles. I wondered if I was keeping up with the Portlandians, and particularly their bread knives, when I compared it with my inexpensive but high-performing Mercer Culinary Millenia.\nThe Mercer is America’s Test Kitchen's top pick for serrated bread knives, with its snub nose and pointy teeth. The black plastic handle is grippy, chunky, and functional. It immediately replaced its predecessor, a nostalgia-inducing but low-performing stainless number that I got in Paris for cheap because it had a crack in the handle.\nLooking at the Steelport 10-inch Bread Knife at my favorite trade show, I daydreamed about how it might work even better than the $25 Mercer. At an astounding 450 bucks … brief pause here as the writer pulls out a calculator and divides 450 by 25 … could it be 18 times better? I will not let that idea waggle around. It was not 18 times better, but I'll let you wonder for a moment if it was maybe a couple.\nLeaving price out of it for a moment, high-end bread knives of this quality have a lot going for them. The Steelport is quite handsome, with a burl-wood handle and gray blade that stand out from the less-interesting knives in your block. At 65 on the Rockwell C scale, it is a particularly hard blade. That level of hardness can make the steel a little brittle but allows the blade to be narrow, extremely sharp, and able to hold a ripping edge for a long time. The handle is a little more \"multi-planar\" than most knives, and it is quite comfortable. The top of the blade, known as the spine, is rounded, something you'll appreciate if you're using it for a long time, as it can keep blisters from forming on your index finger; more knives should do this. There's also a finger nook at the blade heel, which can make you feel more slotted into your grip. One difference between the two knives is that the Mercer has pointier serrations compared to the Steelport's more rounded tips; a choppy ocean versus rolling seas, if you will.\nI thought this might make a noticeable difference so I started cutting stuff up, buying and making loaves, then tearing into them with one knife then the other over the course of a couple of months. Both of them went through sandwich bread with the greatest of ease, with zero damage to the bread itself, the opposite of the manhandling you'd give the loaf if you went at it with a dull chef's knife. I was needlessly concerned when cutting vertically into delicate croissants and even more so when I cut horizontally through the crispy, laminated goodness like you would do to toast it or to make a croissan'wich, but both blades just sliced through, leaving clean edges and neat corners in their wakes.\nUnsurprisingly, they both slipped a little on the thick crust when turning a half boule into slices, but rotating the knife to get it roughly perpendicular to the curved surface for half a stroke until it bit, then going vertical, fixed that easily. The two blades felt so evenly matched that I’d occasionally slice into a bagel or some other loaf with one knife, get distracted for a second, and have no clue which one I had used to make the cut.\nOne day I had crystallized honey trapped inside a plastic bear dispenser and used the knives to saw the beast in half. Knife abuse is bad, but it's certainly easier with an inexpensive knife.\nOK—time for some awkwardness! Is a fancy and expensive bread knife 18 times as good as the top-ranked, 25-dollar competition? Nope. Is it even twice as good? Again, alas, no. I will say more positive stuff on the the slightly more touchy-feely side, however. The Steelport is well designed and handsome, and it feels very good to draw back and forth. The gentle curve of the blade might even give dorks like me an occasional samurai-sword frisson. For those reasons, or at least some of them, you might reach for it a bit more often, or just enjoy staring at it.\nOne particularly appealing service is Steelport’s free sharpening for life, which is done by mailing your blades to them. It’s a nice perk a few other manufacturers, including Cutco, offer. (Side note: Say what you want about Cutco knives, but its $145 bread knife, inexplicably sold as a “carver,” is surprisingly excellent. Just have a knife shop lop off its pointy tip.) You can also sharpen your own serrated knife or find a shop that will do it for you.\nYou might feel better about yourself if you got a Mercer and donated the difference to World Central Kitchen or your local food bank. But if it gives you great pleasure to use a fancy bread knife, and you can afford the price difference, go for it. It works great and looks even better.",

    "content_text": "Most viral videos have a very short half-life, but occasionally they have a much greater impact than you might imagine.\nThe founders of OneCourt, Field of Vision, and Touch2See—based in Seattle; Dublin, Ireland, and Toulouse, France, respectively—weren’t all inspired by exactly the same viral clip, but the videos they did see were all variations on the same basic theme: a blind person having their hands guided by a companion across a facsimile of a soccer pitch in order to better understand what was happening in a live game.\nInstead of quickly becoming yesterday’s news like most others, those videos gave the founders the same idea: to create a device that would change how visually impaired people watch sports forever. All three companies are examples of what OneCourt’s CEO Jerred Mace calls “tactile broadcasters.” And while each of the devices differ in subtle ways, they all aim to do the same thing—convert the on-field action into movement that the user can feel with their fingers.\n“You can't have hundreds of people doing that one-for-one,” says Touch2See sales director John Brimacombe. “So we thought: How can we scale this up and make it more affordable, more accessible, and more pertinent to the modern world?”\nIn recent years there has been a revolution in the world of sports. Professional clubs, in search of marginal gains that can mean the difference between success and failure, started to recruit companies such as Opta Stats and Catapult Sports to collect performance data on their behalf. It’s that data that is being used to power devices like those being developed by Touch2See and OneCourt.\nField of Vision took a slightly different approach, developing its own low-latency cameras that process all the data locally before sending it to the device. But the end result is the same: As the real ball travels around the pitch, a physical representation of it moves across the surface of the device, allowing the user to follow the play in real time.\nTo the unsuspecting observer it looks a little like a sports-themed Ouija board, but there’s nothing sinister about it. “Knowing what's happening as it's happening, and being able to celebrate with everybody else—that’s the magic of it,” says Mace.\nGood Vibes Only\nThe position of the ball in play is just one aspect of a game of soccer, rugby, or basketball, so all three devices also have supplementary ways of communicating match events to the user. Both Touch2See and Field of Vision use vibration-based feedback systems that coincide with different actions, a bit like the force feedback you get from a PlayStation or Xbox controller.\nField of Vision’s device is divided into two parts – one for the home team and the other for the visitors—with the bottom section emitting a deep rumble while the top panel vibrates at a higher frequency. Cofounder Omar Salem calls it a “language of vibrations,” with passes indicated by short buzzes from the relevant section, longer ones signaling a change in possession, and more persistent vibrations to indicate when a goal or try is scored. For sports like rugby or Australian rules football there are also further physical indicators for scrums and marks (a catch that earns the player a free kick).\nOneCourt decided on a different method early in development. Rather than having a mechanism similar to a 3D printer inside, which drags the magnetic “ball” across the surface on top, OneCourt’s hardware uses a pixel-based system that’s a bit like animated braille from beneath. “Our technology co-opts the basic principles of animation that have been proven in our visually dominant world,” explains Mace, using Christmas lights that blink in succession to create the illusion of movement as an example. “But instead of pixels that you see, these are pixels that you feel.”\nThat also changes what OneCourt can do with the top panel of its device. All three companies have interchangeable plates for different sports, with grooves marked in them to show the markings of the playing area at hand, but OneCourt’s approach means it can show multiple “views\" of a game simultaneously.\nThat comes in particularly useful for baseball, with one half of the interface showing where the ball is pitched relative to the batter and the other displaying a top-down view of the diamond and the positions of the runners. For a soccer game, this “split-screen” mode can also be used to provide more contextual detail when a goal is scored.\n“With touch you can't show everything at the same time,” says Mace. “With visual sense, we see the big picture first, and then we pick out details, whereas with touch you're actually starting with the details and then building a bigger picture.”\nPart of that bigger picture is constructed using audio. All three of these devices can accept commentary feeds for connected headphones, but if there aren’t any available or if they’re not in real time and would lag behind the tactile element, OneCourt has a text-to-speech system called \"audio bites” that can turn events labeled within the ball-tracking data into a simple audio description. Touch2See is also working on something similar that differentiates between the actions of the two teams by using distinctly different voices.\nHome and Away\nAnybody who has tried to send a text or check social media inside a busy stadium will understand how difficult that can be when 50,000 people are trying to post Instagram stories at the same time: The networks get overloaded. These company’s devices aren’t magically immune to such problems, but all three are as well-prepared as possible connectivity-wise.\nOneCourt and Field of View favor Wi-Fi but have the capability to use 5G as well, while Touch2See prioritizes 5G because of the mobility that it offers but can fall back on Wi-Fi or even Ethernet if necessary. The method used will vary from stadium to stadium.\nA solid connection is essential for reducing latency, which is usually just an annoyance but here could completely ruin the experience. Even a slight delay where the movement on the device lags a second or so behind the action would render the whole thing pointless, as the reaction of the crowd would give away that something significant had just occurred.\nThat is one of the main reasons Field of View decided to develop its own cameras, because it found the existing data being collected at the stadiums wasn’t always available in real time. It’s theoretically possible for the Field of Vision device to use third-party data as long as the delay is no more than half a second, but it’s yet to be tested without Field of Vision’s own cameras.\nAll three companies also have plans for their devices to be used somewhere that connectivity shouldn’t be an issue: in people’s homes. After all, that’s where technology like this is likely to be most widely used, with far more fans watching sports from the comfort of their sofas than in person.\nMace says OneCourt intends to build its home version of the product over the next six months, and while some hurdles are removed outside the stadium it does introduce some new ones: The tracking data will need to be licensed for use elsewhere, syncing with the broadcast will present a challenge to overcome, and they will need to work out how to offer technical support.\nFull Circle\nFor now, all three companies are focused on making their devices available in as many stadiums and arenas as possible. Touch2See’s most high-profile uses have been at last year’s Olympics and at Ligue 1 soccer matches in France; OneCourt is now available at all Portland Trail Blazers and Sacramento Kings home games in the NBA; and Field of Vision has a deal in place with Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia, for its AFL games, plus its device is now permanently installed at Dublin’s Aviva Stadium.\nIrish rugby fan Martin Gordon, who lost his sight completely more than two decades ago, used Field of Vision’s product for the first time when he attended the Six Nations clash between Ireland and England earlier this year. “They gave me a demonstration, but within 10 or 15 minutes of using it you know the difference between the vibrations,” he says.\nGordon used to play rugby when he was at school, so even just with audio commentary he has a fairly good idea of what’s happening on the pitch in front of him, but he says using Field of Vision makes following the game much more exciting. “For somebody like me who has been on a rugby pitch and knows exactly what one looks like, when I listen to commentary I can picture where the play is, but being able to feel it exactly is incredible. Now somebody who's never even seen a rugby pitch can really get a feel for the game, if you’ll excuse the pun.”\nIn a situation that feels like things have gone full circle, there are now videos going viral of visually impaired fans using these devices at games. In February, TikTok user Anthony Ferraro, who was born with a degenerative eye condition called Leber Congenital Amaurosis, shared a video of himself using OneCourt at a Portland Trail Blazers game. Afterward, he described it as “life-changing.”\nIn December 2024, Sardinian soccer team Caligiari posted a video on Instagram of Daniele Cassioli, a paralympic water-skier who has been blind since birth, using a Touch2See device during a trial at one of the club’s games. Brimacombe says the feedback has been “really emotional,” with some users even brought to tears by the experience, and describes sitting with a fan using a Touch2See device as he raged in unison with the rest of the crowd at a refereeing decision. Because isn’t that what sports is all about?\nGordon is similarly effusive about the impact this kind of technology will have on his enjoyment of the game as a blind spectator. “It completely adds to my experience as a supporter,” he says, “and gives back something huge that was lost for me 23 years ago.”",

    "content_text": "About 12,000 human athletes ran in a half-marathon race in Beijing on Saturday, but most of the attention was on a group of other, more unconventional participants: 21 humanoid robots. The event’s organizers, which included several branches of Beijing’s municipal government, claim it’s the first time humans and bipedal robots have run in the same race, though they jogged on separate tracks. Six of the robots successfully finished the course, but they were unable to keep up with the speed of the humans.\nThe fastest robot, Tiangong Ultra, developed by Chinese robotics company UBTech in collaboration with the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center, finished the race in 2 hours and 40 minutes after assistants changed its batteries three times and it fell down once.\nThe slowest time allowed for human runners in the race was 3 hours and 10 minutes, and Tiangong Ultra was the only robot that barely qualified for a human participation award. Most of the humanoid participants didn’t stay in the game for long and disappeared from the live broadcast soon after they took off from the starting line.\nAlan Fern, a robotics professor at Oregon State University, tells WIRED that researchers who build these robots typically focus on trying to get them to complete tasks and respond effectively in a diverse range of different environments, rather than run as fast as possible. Fern adds that the AI technology used in humanoids hasn't progressed very much since 2021, when his team sent a bipedal robot to run a 5K race.\nWhat the race does demonstrate, he says, is how robust humanoid hardware has become. “Until five years ago or so, we didn't really know how to get robots to walk reliably. And now we do, and this will be a good demonstration of that,” he told WIRED on Thursday before the race took place. His team’s robot fell twice during the 2021 5K run, once due to operator error and another due to overheating. “The impressive thing about going from a 5K to a half-marathon is really a hardware robustness problem. And you know, I'll be surprised if one of these companies makes it through without replacing the robot,” he says.\nFern’s predictions were totally right. On Saturday, almost every robot fell down and faced overheating problems, prompting their operators to switch them out for new replacements. While the event did generate a lot of interest and pride among Chinese people—many human runners stopped to take selfies with Tiangong Ultra when they saw it—it also showed the reality and limitations of China’s humanoid robot industry.\nImpressive-looking humanoid robots developed by several Chinese companies have made international headlines this year. One robot firm called Unitree, for example, went viral in January after it sent an army of robots to perform synchronized dances during China’s Spring Festival gala on state TV. Unitree didn’t officially participate in the race, but two of its robots were running the half-marathon while being operated by other institutions. (One of its robots fell on the ground before reaching the starting line and struggled to stand up quickly.)\nWhile capabilities like dancing can be fun and eye-catching, they don’t actually show how useful humanoid robots are in real-world situations, says Fern. Even being able to run a half-marathon isn’t a very useful benchmark for their skills—it’s not like there’s market demand for robots that can compete with human runners. The benchmarks that Fern says matter to him are how well they can handle diverse real-world tasks without step-by-step human instructions. “But I would expect to see China shifting this year to focusing more on doing useful things, because people are going to be bored of dancing and karate,” Fern says.\nThe robots who participated in the race came in a variety of forms. The shortest was 2' 5\" tall. Sporting a blue and white tracksuit and waving to onlookers every few seconds, it was probably the crowd favorite. The tallest, at 5'9\", was the winner Tiangong Ultra.\nWhat all of the robots have in common is that they are bipedal instead of running on wheels, a requirement to participate in the race. As long as the robots met that requirement, they were free to get creative, and the companies behind them adopted a wide range of strategies to try to get an advantage over their competitors. Some were wearing kid-sized sneakers (though screwed to their pedals to avoid falling off). Others were equipped with knee pads to protect their delicate parts from damage when they fell. Most of the robots had their fingers removed, and some were even missing heads—you don't need such parts for running, after all, and taking them off reduces a robot’s weight and the amount of burden placed on their motors.\nTiangong Ultra and another model, the N2 robot made by Chinese company Noetix Robotics, which won second place in the race, stood out for their consistent, albeit slow pace. The performance of the other humanoids was mostly disastrous. One robot called Huanhuan, which has a humanlike head, only moved at the speed of a snail for a few minutes while its head shook uncontrollably—as if it could fall off any time.\nAnother robot named Shennong looks like a real Frankenstein’s monster, with the head that resembles Gundam and four drone propellers that face backward. It sits on a foundation with eight wheels, and it’s not clear how that alone wasn’t disqualifying. But that wasn’t even Shennong’s biggest problem, as the robot immediately twirled in two circles after taking off from the starting line, hit the wall, and dragged down its human operators with it. It was painful to watch.\nDuct tape proved to be the most effective problem-solving tool. Not only did the accompanying humans make makeshift robot shoes with duct tape, they also used it to adhere the head of a robot back onto its body after it repeatedly fell off during the run, making for some very jarring scenes.\nEvery robot had human operators, often two or three running beside them. Some held control panels that allowed them to give the robot instructions, including how fast to go, while other operators led the way for their robots and tried to clear potential obstacles on the ground. Quite a few of the humanoids were being held on what looked like, well, pet leashes. “You wanna think of these robots more like running a remote control car through the race. But the robots don't have wheels,” says Fern.\nIn fact, by the end of the race, many people who tuned into the livestream started to comment on how exhausted the robots’ human operators looked. They were guiding the robots where to go, furiously changing their batteries, and endlessly spraying liquid on them to cool down their motors, all while running (or walking, to be honest) 13.1 miles on their own.\nBesides running and tripping, some of the robots also performed dances and backflips. Seven robot dogs and one humanoid also performed more dances on a nearby stage. At the end, yet another robot brought the trophies onto the award stage and presented them to their four fellow robots who completed the run.\nThe limitations of the robots, however, could make for some memorable scenes. Xuanfeng Xiaozi, a robot developed by the Chinese company Noetix, started off strong but broke down more and more frequently toward the end of the race. At one point, it fully plunged to the ground, face down, and its head became dislodged from its body. A team of human operators quickly swooped in with duct tape to fix things and put Xuanfeng Xiaozi back on its way.\nWhen it was finally almost done with the race, Xuanfeng Xiaozi had a cooling pad attached to its front and its right foot was out of step with its left, and yet it managed to wobble to the finish line, where the runner-up robot, made by the same company, had been waiting for it for 10 minutes. The half-marathon certainly showed off the design flaws of these robots far more than their capabilities. But still, at that moment, I was really happy to see Xuanfeng Xiaozi finish the race.",

    "content_text": "On Monday, a developer using the popular AI-powered code editor Cursor noticed something strange: Switching between machines instantly logged them out, breaking a common workflow for programmers who use multiple devices. When the user contacted Cursor support, an agent named \"Sam\" told them it was expected behavior under a new policy. But no such policy existed, and Sam was a bot. The AI model made the policy up, sparking a wave of complaints and cancellation threats documented on Hacker News and Reddit.\nThis marks the latest instance of AI confabulations (also called \"hallucinations\") causing potential business damage. Confabulations are a type of \"creative gap-filling\" response where AI models invent plausible-sounding but false information. Instead of admitting uncertainty, AI models often prioritize creating plausible, confident responses, even when that means manufacturing information from scratch.\nFor companies deploying these systems in customer-facing roles without human oversight, the consequences can be immediate and costly: frustrated customers, damaged trust, and, in Cursor's case, potentially canceled subscriptions.\nHow It Unfolded\nThe incident began when a Reddit user named BrokenToasterOven noticed that while swapping between a desktop, laptop, and a remote dev box, Cursor sessions were unexpectedly terminated.\n\"Logging into Cursor on one machine immediately invalidates the session on any other machine,\" BrokenToasterOven wrote in a message that was later deleted by r/cursor moderators. \"This is a significant UX regression.\"\nConfused and frustrated, the user wrote an email to Cursor support and quickly received a reply from Sam: \"Cursor is designed to work with one device per subscription as a core security feature,\" read the email reply.

We have no such policy,\" wrote a Cursor representative in a Reddit reply three hours later. \"You're of course free to use Cursor on multiple machines. Unfortunately, this is an incorrect response from a front-line AI support bot.\"\nAI Confabulations as a Business Risk\nThe Cursor debacle recalls a similar episode from February 2024 when Air Canada was ordered to honor a refund policy invented by its own chatbot. In that incident, Jake Moffatt contacted Air Canada's support after his grandmother died, and the airline's AI agent incorrectly told him he could book a regular-priced flight and apply for bereavement rates retroactively. When Air Canada later denied his refund request, the company argued that \"the chatbot is a separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions.\" A Canadian tribunal rejected this defense, ruling that companies are responsible for information provided by their AI tools.\nRather than disputing responsibility as Air Canada had done, Cursor acknowledged the error and took steps to make amends. Cursor cofounder Michael Truell later apologized on Hacker News for the confusion about the non-existent policy, explaining that the user had been refunded and the issue resulted from a backend change meant to improve session security that unintentionally created session invalidation problems for some users.\n\"Any AI responses used for email support are now clearly labeled as such,\" he added. \"We use AI-assisted responses as the first filter for email support.\"\nStill, the incident raised lingering questions about disclosure among users, since many people who interacted with Sam apparently believed it was human. \"LLMs pretending to be people (you named it Sam!) and not labeled as such is clearly intended to be deceptive,\" one user wrote on Hacker News.\nWhile Cursor fixed the technical bug, the episode shows the risks of deploying AI models in customer-facing roles without proper safeguards and transparency. For a company selling AI productivity tools to developers, having its own AI support system invent a policy that alienated its core users represents a particularly awkward self-inflicted wound.\n\"There is a certain amount of irony that people try really hard to say that hallucinations are not a big problem anymore,\" one user wrote on Hacker News, \"and then a company that would benefit from that narrative gets directly hurt by it.\"\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "The Best Apple Watch Accessories\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nIf you have an iPhone, there’s a good chance you also have an Apple Watch. We’ve rated it the best smartwatch and the best fitness tracker for iPhone owners. It dominates the smartwatch category.\nIt's also one of the easiest Apple products to accessorize, even if you might not need to (I’ve never cracked an Apple Watch screen or case). Apple offers an extended warranty plan, which is worth considering, given that service pricing for watch repairs is exorbitant. If you turn it down, however, these screen protectors, cases, and Apple Watch straps can help extend the life of your indispensable timer/alarm clock/sleep tracker.\nStill haven’t decided which model to get? Read our Best Apple Watch guide, and check out our Best Apple 3-in-1 Chargers for smart ways to keep all your devices recharged.\nUpdated April 2025: We've added the Powerbeats Pro 2, the Apple Hermés Kilim band, and the Nomad cable for Apple Watch.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nThe Best Charging Stand\nBelkin\n3-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand\nThe worst part about owning an Apple Watch is that even the longest-lived of them, the Watch Ultra 2, lasts only a few days. To keep your watch reliably charged while also wearing it to track your sleep, you must seed your house with wireless Apple Watch chargers so that you can top it off in between other activities. The best 3-in-1 charger is Belkin's classy Qi2 charging stand, which uses the Qi2 fast wireless charging standard and can fast-charge a Watch Series 7 or newer.\nThe Hermés Band\nApple\nHermés Kilim Single Tour Band\nThe collaboration between Apple and the French luxury house Hermés is incredibly successful. It demonstrates that the Apple Watch is truly capable of crossing over into the luxury watch market—there's even a distinct Series 10 and Watch Ultra 2 Hermés edition. For obvious reasons, no reviewer has ever received a Hermés edition to test, so WIRED commerce director Martin Cizmar bought the Hermés band after the orange Alpine loop on his Ultra got too dirty.\nYou should not buy this band if you have to buy groceries instead, but Cizmar notes that after a month, it remains quite a nice watch band. The fluoroelastomer feels soft but sturdy against the skin and washes better than the Alpine Loop. The brand-stamped quick-release clasp (deployment buckle) makes it a breeze to take on or off.\nThe Best Headphones\nApple\nAirPods Pro 2 (With USB-C)\nThe best part of an Apple Watch is that it can connect seamlessly to all your Apple products. One of the first things you'll probably want to do with yours is take a walk around the block while listening to a podcast with your new AirPods Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends). To pair, tap Settings > Bluetooth on the watch and choose your accessory, though you'll probably see a prompt to pair as soon as you open the case. Make sure your chosen podcast or playlist is downloaded on your watch before you set out, phone-free.\nThe instantly recognizable design has not changed visibly much since the 2019 iteration, but this generation—Apple says it's the second, but it's really the third—has noticeably better sound quality, better battery life, and a few software updates, like Adaptive Audio, which quiets your music whenever it hears you talking, so you can hear someone's response. The biggest change? The case now has USB-C charging, which means you can charge it up with your MacBook, iPhone, or iPad cable.\nThe Best Watch Ultra Band\nApple\nMilanese Titanium Band\nMy favorite band for my favorite watch, the Watch Ultra 2, is the black titanium Milanese loop, which matches the Watch Ultra 2's black finish. The standout feature (I know, I know) is the parachute-style buckle, which Apple claims was historically used for diving and other underwater activities. (I seem to remember that most water activities use ratchet tie downs and threaded cam buckles for straps, but I will let this slide.) The buckle is very smooth and satisfying to clip in and out when you're on a phone call or in a meeting. The titanium doesn't irritate my skin, and the band is smooth and easy to adjust. It's carbon-neutral, and it looks very, very good. It turns your sporty watch into a much dressier watch.\nThe Best Cable\nNomad Universal Cable for Apple Watch\nAs my colleague Simon Hill says in his Best USB-C Cables guide, this Nomad cable is way too expensive. However, it is undeniably handy—pack a single cable for your iPhone and your Apple Watch. It's Kevlar-reinforced, and the braided finish is nice. You can also charge your AirPods on the charging puck as well as your Apple Watch.\nThe Best Workout Headphones\nBeats\nPowerbeats Pro 2\nNot only are the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) the best workout headphones if you have an Apple Watch, they are the best workout headphones, period. They now even have a heart rate monitor that's built off the one used in the Apple Watch! If you already own an Apple Watch, this feature is superfluous, as iOS will prioritize the Apple Watch's more sophisticated readings over the earbuds. But if you run with third-party fitness apps like Nike Run Club or Peloton, you will find the extra data useful.\nOn top of that, the buds are crazy comfortable, sound great, have excellent noise canceling, and most of the aforementioned Apple exclusive features, like hands-free Siri (no Adaptive Audio, however, sad). The case also has wireless charging and, unlike many of Apple's other products, it comes in bright, fun colors. (Our test unit is Electric Orange, but I find the Hyper Purple to be just as good.)\nThe Best Workout App\nApple\nFitness+\nI am guessing you wanted an Apple Watch in part because you needed a fitness tracker. I run, swim, and rock climb, and I think that the Apple Watch is currently one of the best running watches available. Most great fitness apps work on the Apple Watch, like Strava, Peloton, or Nike Run Club. However, if you're firmly ensconced in the Apple walled garden, the best fitness app is probably Apple's own Fitness+, which seamlessly interacts between the Watch, the iPhone, and the Apple TV+.\nI like it mainly because it's included with my family's Apple One subscription, but it's also incredibly convenient. There is now coaching for outdoor walks and runs (although there is another Apple app I use for this, which is Podcasts). The workouts are unintimidating, and a lot of them are very short. Those five minutes when I was not responding to your Slack? I was probably doing a five-minute core workout! Sorry, it's just hard for me to sit still! For more fitness apps and services, check out our roundup.\nA Compact Charger for Travel\nAnker\nMagGo 3-in-1 Charging Station (Qi2)\nThe Native Union Voyage ($100) is the travel charger I carry the most often. It's a 2-in-1 charger for your phone and Apple Watch that plugs in via USB, fits neatly into the palm of my hand, and slips into my tech pouch. However, for the same amount of money, this one is better because Anker's tiny, foldable Qi2 wireless charger includes a third pad for charging your AirPods. Nothing more convenient than that.\nBest Sustainable Band\nAt 2023's Apple event, the company announced that when purchased in conjunction with a soft recycled nylon sport loop ($49), the Series 9 is carbon neutral. We viewed these claims with a bit of skepticism, and in any case, many of the bands that Apple and other third-party manufacturers offer will not be carbon neutral. However, I like the Nike sports band very much. It comes in two different sizes with aluminum hardware. The soft, 32 percent recycled fluoroelastomer is also enlivened with little flecks of recycled plastic in it. It also has little holes in the band, which increase the breathability and also let you add little charms.\nThe Best Travel Power Bank\nOneAdaptr\nOneGo 3-in-1 Power Bank\nA travel power bank is handy when you're out and about with your watch for any length of time and don't have access to a wall outlet. I have the Journey Glyde 4-in-1 power bank ($170), which also has a 10,000-mAh capacity and adheres to the Qi2 wireless charging standard. However, my colleague Simon's pick is just as compact, much cheaper, and doubles as a kickstand, even if you can't plug devices into it with a cable.\nA Few Watch Charms\nWithIt\nHope Charm Set\nJust as you can slap stickers on your water bottle or laptop, or add jingly Jibbitz charms to your Crocs, you can now add personalized charms to your Apple Watch band. I am a grown woman and the mother of two elementary-schoolers, and I am too old for this. However, my 7-year-old and 9-year-old also have Apple Watches and were thrilled at the assortment that WithIt sent.\nWithIt's charms are designed to be used specifically with WithIt's own Band Candy straps (set $35), but I found that they worked well with the Nike straps or any straps with holes in them. These are sparkly and fun, but I feel obligated to point out that you can find almost any charms you can think of on Amazon at varied prices.\nA Good Leather Band\nBluebonnet\nExecutive French Leather Band\nCloth straps are comfortable and wick away moisture, but they hold the moisture and aren't very formal. Silicone straps are durable and waterproof, but they trap sweat. I have sensitive skin and need to wash silicone straps and let my wrist breathe occasionally if I don't want to get rashes. Leather, on the other hand, is durable. It's comfortable to wear and breathable, and it will mold to your skin. It's also far more stylish and professional than cloth or silicone.\nBluebonnet is a small Texas-based company that makes Apple Watch straps out of full-grain calf leather. I was very impressed by the thickness of the leather and the build quality of the Apple Watch inserts and buckle (whether the metal parts are silver or stainless steel varies depending on the color of the band). It fit my 41-mm Series 7 perfectly. But if you have a smaller wrist, you will probably need to punch an extra hole or two in the band. Avoid the temptation to use a knife—either get a leather hole punch or take it to a shop.\n★ Alternative: Quince is a direct-to-consumer business that purports to offer luxury essentials at an affordable price. The leather on its Apple Watch strap ($30) is stiffer and thinner, the color is not as vibrant, and the hardware is weird—I'm not sure why the buckle has an extra loop on top. However, it comes in two sizes, and the small size fits my Watch SE well. If you want a cheaper option, this one will work.\nA Fun Jelly Strap\nBaozai Apple Watch Jelly Strap\nIn the course of testing for this guide, I've discovered that the best accessory isn't always the most expensive. We've tried several cheap jelly bands from Amazon, which fluctuate in and out of stock. The one currently in stock is this slim one, which former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano said she consistently gets compliments on and fits her watch well. Most importantly, it comes in pink!\nThe Sturdiest Case\nNomad\nRugged 45-mm Case\nThe Watch Ultra 2 is great, but you can get many of the same sports-related features in the regular Apple Watch with watchOS 11. This rugged sports case from Nomad is expensive, but at $399 for the Series 10 and $120 for the case, it's still less expensive than a $799 Watch Ultra 2. Nomad's case fits the 45/44 mm Series 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and SE. The case has a tough stainless steel body with a protective TPU lining. I tried it with a 45-mm Series 8, and it fit fine, and the buttons work great. However, it's only compatible with the larger watch size. I also have a smallish 150-mm wrist, and it just barely fits me.\nIf this costs too much, check out Otterbox's Apple Watch bumpers ($40). They fit well and come in a wider variety of sizes and colors (and are also much cheaper).\nBest Band Storage\nTwelve South\nTimePorter Watch Band Wall Mount\nEven the most restrained and minimalist among us probably have at least two bands: a nylon sport loop for everyday wear, and a titanium or steel band for when you have to dress up. (You will still probably look hopelessly dorky, but one can hope.)\nYou could always keep your spare bands in a shoebox on your dresser, but I really like this hanger from Twelve South. The wall mount is incredibly easy to use—just make sure you're not hanging it upside down and stick it on your wall. The bands slot neatly in a compressive groove at the top. Each holder fits up to six bands, but you can easily add more if your collection is bigger than mine.\nThe Smallest Case\nHontao Ultra Thin Case\nUnlike a phone, a watch is worn on your wrist, so every millimeter of real estate counts. If all you want is a thin, affordable, and attractive bumper that will protect your watch from bumps and bangs throughout the day, this is my favorite. It's made from a matte thermoplastic urethane (TPU) that is extremely thin and fits a 41-mm watch well. The dark green color I tried is well represented by the images on the website. However, reviews say the lighter colors show dirt very easily, so I would stick with darker shades.\n★ Alternative: The Spigen Thin Fit ($15) is also a very nice, minimal case. But it's a bit pricier, and the plastic is not as soft to the touch.\nBest Screen Protector\nLK Apple Watch Screen Protector\nAs with straps, the best protector is not always the brand-name option or the most expensive one. I tried screen protectors from Spigen and Zagg, but when I pushed or pulled a case on over them, the thin films peeled off or bubbled almost instantly. This screen protector—also made from TPU—was easy to apply and looks invisible once it's on.\nI particularly like the small rubber installation pad, which held the watch much more securely than other installation plates. Even if it's reasonably easy to use, I recommend watching the short instructional video before putting the screen protector on. Don't worry—if you mess up, it includes several replacements.\nThe Best Action Camera\nInsta360\nX4 360 Camera\nYou can overlay your fitness stats over your video while filming with the Insta360 X series. Simply connect the camera to your Insta360 X4 and authorize the Insta360 app to connect to Apple Health. The Insta360 X4 also connects to Garmin and GPS devices. Great for any vlogger showing the world their fitness journey.\nAvoid These Accessories\nApple Solo Loop for $49: Apple really hawks its precisely sized Solo Loops, which form a single loop around your wrist. But they're expensive, and as an active person, I can't size them correctly. They're always too tight when I'm working out and too loose when I'm not. I prefer an adjustable band.\nZagg InvisibleShield GlassFusion Screen Protector for $30: There is no earthly reason why this screen protector should be so expensive. It also bubbled within several days.\nWired Coupons\n10% off Dell Coupon Code for New Customers\nSamsung Promo Code: 10% off TVs\nBusiness PCs - Extra 5% Off HP Coupon Code\n10% off Canon promo code with upgrade\nExclusive NordVPN Coupon: 76% off\nLG Promo Code: 20% Off Your First Order",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nFINDING THE BEST iPad should be simple. You just get whatever’s new, right? If only. Apple sells four main iPad models, each with its strengths and varying sizes. In addition, a growing number of older iPads are floating around the eBays of the world. Since all these devices largely look the same, it’s important to know what you’re buying and what you should pay for it. This guide covers the iPad models available right now, what’s coming up, the important differences between them, and the old versions that exist (including the ones you shouldn’t buy at any price). I also break down which Apple Pencil is right for you.\nBe sure to check out all our buying guides, including the Best iPad Accessories, Best iPhones, Best iPhone 16 Cases, Best Tablets, and Best MacBooks.\nUpdated April 2025: We've added our thoughts on the Apple iPad (A16).\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore. Subscribe Today.\nWhich iPad Do You Own?\nThere are tons of iPads out in the world, and it can be tough to figure out exactly what model you own if you're thinking of selling it or you're looking for accessories and want to make sure they'll work with your iPad. Apple also doesn't name its slates sequentially as it does with the iPhone, only adding to the confusion. No matter. Finding your model is simple.\n- Look at the back of your iPad. Etched on the back cover, near where it says \"Designed by Apple in California,\" should be a model number starting with the letter A.\n- Head to this website from Apple. Look for your corresponding model number, and that's it! You found your iPad model. (Pro tip: Use your browser's \"Find in Page\" function to type in your model number and find it quickly.)\nAccessory makers usually indicate which iPad a case, folio, or keyboard cover is designed to work with. If you see a retailer mentioning a specific generation or processor, this is Apple's current lineup:\n- iPad: 11th generation (A16, 2025)\n- iPad Mini: 7th generation (A17 Pro, 2024)\n- iPad Air 11-inch: 7th generation (M3, 2025)\n- iPad Air 13-inch: 2nd generation (M3, 2025)\n- iPad Pro 11-inch: 5th generation (M4, 2024)\n- iPad Pro 13-inch: 7th generation (M4, 2024)\nExclusive iPadOS Features\nThere are a few features only available on M1, M2, M3, and M4-powered iPad models, while others are exclusive to the iPad Pro. Be sure to check out our iPadOS 18 roundup for the latest features.\n- Reference Mode: Available on the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with M1, M2, and M4. Reference Mode allows you to use the tablet as a reference monitor to ensure color accuracy and consistent image quality when editing photos or videos with a secondary display.\n- Stage Manager: Available on iPads with M1, M2, M3, M4, and older iPad Pro models (2018 onward) with the A12X and A12Z chips. For a desktop-like multitasking experience, Stage Manager allows you to resize windows, overlap them, and group them together. You'll also see recently used apps and windows appear on the left side of your screen.\n- External Display Support: Available on iPads with M1, M2, M3, and M4. When using Stage Manager, you can also connect the iPad Pro and iPad Air to an external display with resolutions up to 6K. That way, instead of mirroring the iPad to the display, you can access four apps on the external display and four apps on the tablet.\n- Virtual Memory Swap: Available on iPads with M1, M2, M3, and M4. If you're in need of more memory for RAM-intensive apps, Virtual Memory Swap will increase the available memory for all your apps and provide up to 16 GB for more taxing apps. If you're using an M1-powered iPad Air, this feature is only available on the 256-GB version.\n- Apple Pencil Hover: Available on both sizes of the iPad Pro (M2 and M4) and iPad Air (M2 and M3). Using the second-generation Apple Pencil (on the M2-powered iPad Pro) and Apple Pencil Pro, you can hover the stylus millimeters above the screen and see a preview of what will happen before touching the display. For example, with a third-party graphic editing app like Pixelmator, hovering allows you to cycle through presets to see a live preview, or you can hover over a cropped photo to see the original image.\nWhich iPads Support Apple Intelligence?\nApple has been on a tirade touting Apple Intelligence, a suite of artificial intelligence features available in select hardware across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We break down many of the new Apple Intelligence features in our iOS 18 roundup if you'd like to learn more. Unfortunately, it’s not available on all iPad models. The following iPads support Apple Intelligence:\n- iPad Mini (7th gen, A17 Pro)\n- iPad Air (5th gen, M1)\n- iPad Air (6th gen, M2)\n- iPad Air (7th gen, M3)\n- iPad Pro (5th gen, M1)\n- iPad Pro (6th gen, M2)\n- iPad Pro (7th gen, M4)\nAvoid These iPads\nThe iPad Mini 1 through 5 and iPad 1 through 9 have low-resolution, pixelated screens or are just too old. Forget buying one of the old 2014 iPad Air 1 or 2015 Air 2—those are too long in the tooth. Just don’t. Yes, money is tight, but your sanity is important. There’s a chance an older iPad could perform decently, but unless someone is giving you one for free, try to hunt for a newer model. Many of the older iPads no longer receive software updates, and they'll seem quite slow compared to your phone and your computer.\nPeruse our Best Tablets guide for ideas if you don't want to spend a lot. If you’re buying something for a child to use, our Best Kids' Tablets guide has good options with kid-friendly features and parental controls.\nShould You Buy an Older iPad Pro?\nApple has always packed a little extra into its iPad Pro tablets. It's still totally fine to buy the 2021 11-inch iPad Pro and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro if you can even find them, but try not to spend more than $600 and $850, respectively. Anything more and you may as well buy the latest. These models are all powerful and match the current Pro slates in many ways; they also work with the first-generation Magic Keyboard with Trackpad. But again, cross-check prices with more recent models.\nOlder iPad Pro models, like the models from 2018 or 2020, are not worth buying (if they're even available). They're just too old.\nIs Now a Good Time to Buy?\nYes. Apple launched a new iPad Air and base iPad in March of this year. There was also a new iPad Pro in May of 2024, along with a new iPad Mini in October. Apple may be working on an M5-powered iPad Pro for later this year, but the M4 model is still an excellent tablet and plenty powerful.\nOther iPads to Consider\nApple no longer sells these iPads, but these slightly older models are still good options, as long as you can find them for the right discount. I recommend checking third-party retailers (like Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H). I also suggest cross-checking the price with the latest models to make sure you're spending a fair amount less on the older tablet. Older models not mentioned here are increasingly hard to find and might not be worth it.\niPad Pro (2022, 6th Gen): These iPad Pro tablets (7/10, WIRED Review) use the same M2 chip that's inside the MacBook Air (2022), Mac Mini, and iPad Air (2024). It also has an excellent mini-LED screen (with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate) along with a dual camera system (with a lidar sensor), a front-facing camera with support for Center Stage, as well as great speakers and mics. It's compatible with the original Magic Keyboard case, second-generation Apple Pencil, and Apple Pencil with USB-C. I only recommend it if you can find the 11-inch for $749 or less and the 12.9-inch for $900 or less.\niPad Air (2022, 5th Gen): This iPad Air has an M1 processor (which can also be found in the 2020 MacBook Air), a 10.9-inch LCD screen, a USB-C port, Touch ID built into the top power button, and 5G support. It's a great, lightweight tablet that's plenty powerful for most tasks. It packs support for the second-generation Apple Pencil, Apple Pencil with USB-C, and the Magic Keyboard case. I only recommend it for $450 or less.\niPad (2022, 10th Gen): The 10th gen iPad comes with an A14 Bionic chip (the same that's in the iPhone 12), a modern design (in fun colors, too), 10.9-inch Liquid Retina (IPS LCD) display, a USB-C port, Touch ID integrated into the power button, a 12-megapixel selfie camera, 12-megapixel rear camera, and support for 5G. It's also compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil, Apple Pencil (USB-C), Magic Keyboard Folio, and Smart Folio. It's worth noting, however, that the display isn't fully laminated, so there's a gap between the screen and the glass that might make the Apple Pencil feel less precise. It's a solid choice if you're looking for a basic, affordable iPad. But seeing as how it's now three years old, I only recommend it for $260 or less.\niPad Air (2024, M2): This iPad Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is less than a year old, so it's still an excellent option. You'll have the choice between an 11-inch and a 13-inch Liquid Retina display, but both are powered by an M2 chip (the same one that powers the 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro from 2022). Additional features include a USB-C port, Touch ID built into the power button, and a 12-megapixel sensor in landscape orientation (with support for Center Stage). It's also compatible with Apple Pencil (USB-C), Apple Pencil Pro, first-gen Magic Keyboard case, and the Smart Folio case. I only recommend it if you can find the 11-inch version for under $400 and the 13-inch for $600 or less.\nGreat iPad Accessories\niPad accessories are endless. Below, we've highlighted some of our favorites to round out your tablet experience, and you can find more in our Best iPad Accessories guide.\nZugu Case for $50: This is our favorite folio case for the iPad for multiple reasons. It's not only durable (complete with a rigid bumper), but it also has a magnetized cover that stays shut and a flap that allows you to position the screen at eight different angles. The case is magnetic, allowing you to stick it on the fridge securely. It's also reasonably priced, comes in an array of colors, and has a spot for your Apple Pencil.\nSatechi M1 Wireless Mouse for $30: We're already big fans of Satechi's accessories at WIRED, and this mouse didn't disappoint. It has a comfortable ergonomic design, a sleek aluminum finish, and smooth scrolling. It has great battery life too—with a built-in lithium-ion battery, I've been using it for the past four months and have yet to charge it.\nMageasy CoverBuddy Case (iPad Pro) for $65: This case allows you to magnetically connect it to Apple's Magic Keyboard case without having to take off the case each time. It feels durable and doesn't add too much bulk to the iPad. There's also a slot for the Apple Pencil Pro or the USB-C version. The company also offers the CoverBuddy Lite for the iPad Air (M2).\nLogitech Combo Touch (10th-Gen) for $220: The Combo Touch (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a built-in keyboard, trackpad, and kickstand, making it ideal for getting work done on your iPad. It's also detachable, so you can easily remove the keyboard when you don't need it. It connects via Apple's Smart Connector, meaning you never need to tinker with Bluetooth or bother charging it. It's also available for the iPad Pro (M4) (although it does add a bit of weight to such a thin tablet) and the iPad Air (M2).\nCasetify Impact Screen Protector for $56: If you're worried about damaging your iPad screen, I recommend this protector from Casetify. It's super thin, has excellent touch sensitivity, and is mostly fingerprint-resistant (I've wiped some smudges here and there). It's painless to apply—the company supplies a microfiber cloth, a de-dusting sticker, and wet and dry wipes.\nPaperlike Charcoal Folio Case for $65: Paperlike is known for its screen protector, but the company also offers a great case. It's designed to feel like a sketchbook, complete with a polyester fabric cover that feels lightweight and high-quality. You can also prop your iPad up at two different levels. It doesn't come with an Apple Pencil slot, but there is a large flap closure that keeps it from falling out. I tested it with the iPad Air, but it's also available for the iPad Pro (both sizes).\nTwelve South StayGo Mini USB-C Hub for $60: Ports are limited regardless of the iPad model. This hub from Twelve South has an 85-watt USB-C port with passthrough charging, a USB-A port, an HDMI, and a headphone jack. If you have trouble fitting it on an iPad with a case, the included socket-USB-C-to-plug-USB-C cable will fix this.\nApple Magic Trackpad (USB-C) for $129: For a spacious trackpad, the Magic Trackpad 2 is a great choice. Instead of physical buttons, it has Force Touch sensors where you can feel different levels of pressure on the pad. With support for various iPadOS gestures, you won't have to touch the screen as much. It automatically pairs with your iPad via Bluetooth and recharges with the Lightning port.\nLogitech K380 Bluetooth Keyboard for $40: If you prefer an external keyboard, it's hard to go wrong with the Logitech K380. It's lightweight and portable and can be connected to up to three devices via Bluetooth (with dedicated buttons to switch between them). The keyboard is powered by AAA batteries, which lasted us around four months, so you don't have to worry about carrying a charger around.\nTwelve South HoverBar Duo 2.0 for $80: The HoverBar serves two purposes.

It's worth noting, however, that the display isn't fully laminated, so there's a gap between the screen and the glass that might make the Apple Pencil feel less precise.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nI might be a mom, but I've become one hell of a dad with my new hobby: vacuuming the cars every weekend.\nMy adorable, Cheerio-throwing toddler drives me to the end of my rope each week after seeing the state our cars end up in. Our vehicles descend into a madness of half-eaten snacks, piles of sand (there's somehow always sand), a toy graveyard, and random trash by every Saturday morning, if not Tuesday afternoon. I can't let it stand. Nothing chases away my Sunday scaries like getting our cars spick-and-span on the inside, leaving me excited for that Monday-morning day-care drive with a clean car.\nSo it's no surprise I have a handful of vacuums I've tried in my never-ending quest to keep our cars somewhat clean. I've used a stick vacuum base, a handheld vac, and even tiny vacuums that are meant for countertop messes. But the cutest one of all is easy to name: the Worx Cordless Cube Vacuum.\nDoes a vacuum need to be cute? Of course not. But being able to get my car clean (already something that brings me joy) with an item I find visually pleasing and adorably small scratches my brain in the best kind of way.\nReady to Roll\nThis little vacuum is made for on-the-go cleaning. The handle has the power button on it, so you can easily turn it off or switch the power level while holding it. This makes it convenient to spot clean or move around to the other side of the car without having to pause. Literally handy. Also handy? The two included attachments have storage compartments inside the vacuum's body, so you can easily switch around what tool you're using or store it away without needing to leave wherever you're vacuuming. For such a small vacuum, it's doing the work of larger vacuums that double as storage for their own accessories.\nIt doesn't have a massive dustbin, though the 7-ounce capacity is similar to the Dyson Humdinger ($250), our favorite handheld vacuum. I found it to be plenty of space as I vacuumed up the entirety of my four-seater sedan—trunk and carseat included—though it likely wouldn't be enough space if you were cleaning something more intense than a dirty car. The Worx should get about 10 minutes on the high-speed setting and about 25 minutes on the low-speed setting. I usually vacuum on the low speed, though I rarely run the vacuum for more than 10 consecutive minutes.\nThis little cube is also plenty small enough to stash anywhere in your garage or hall closet without being a burden. I'm stashing mine on the tool shelf in our garage. The battery clips on and off and looks like the base for a drill, and it comes with a little charging base to charge it. You should charge it after use since it's so small, unless you're certain you vacuum your car in a handful of minutes. The battery isn't designed for extreme weather, so while I could throw it in my trunk during spring here in sunny San Diego, it's best used at a normal room (or garage) temperature.\nFun Size\nSmall things bring me joy, and I don't think I'm alone in feeling that way. There are articles and videos and Reddit threads dedicated to exploring why we love miniature items. While this cube vacuum isn't so small that it could be a dollhouse vacuum, the petite take on what could have been a massive shop vacuum still satisfies that part of my brain that wants things around me to be cute and small.\nMuch in the way tiny things make our brains feel in control and organized, vacuuming my car brings me that sense of satisfaction and power over one of the messy aspects of my life. Getting to do it with a fun little tool only adds to the serotonin boost of what would otherwise feel like a monotonous task. It also offers some of the escapism my little Lego sets once offered me, though instead of a made-up universe, it's a life where everything is as clean and organized as the vacuum lines in my car trunk.\nThis little cube vacuum might not have the most accessories, the biggest dustbin, or the longest running time, but it's a nice in-between of all these features and a good size for the art of car vacuuming. Because for some of us, it is an art, or at least an escape from the cycle of messes that plague our lives.",

    "content_text": "Once upon a time, every AeroPress was the best AeroPress. But the humble AeroPress coffee maker has since multiplied. It has become various. The past half decade or so has brought an explosion of new versions of AeroPress: a plastic-free premium AeroPress (7/10, WIRED Recommends), a big AeroPress, a small AeroPress, a red AeroPress, a blue AeroPress.\nBut at its heart, the AeroPress remains a compact and ingeniously simple coffee maker, using pressure applied by hand to extract a smooth but richly flavorful and aromatic cup. Famously created by a Stanford-educated inventor previously known for improving the aerodynamics of the flying disc, each AeroPress looks a bit like a fat syringe that injects brewed coffee through a filter and into your waiting mug. It doesn't seem like it should make coffee as good as it does. And yet it does, attaining a result somewhere between French press, espresso, and filter coffee. Feel free to follow the recipe on the box. But the device also allows a remarkable amount of control over your coffee as you adjust grind, brewing time, agitation, bloom, and filter of choice.\nThe AeroPress has inspired cultish fandom since its introduction in 2005, not to mention a burgeoning aftermarket of accessories and mods. And yet it took till 2019 for AeroPress to release a second model, a slightly smaller travel version called the AeroPress Go (9/10, WIRED Recommends). After equity company Tiny Capital acquired a majority stake in AeroPress in 2021, the portal to the AeroPress multiverse was thrown open. Aeropress now makes alternate filters, flow-control caps, gadget organizers, and a hot pink AeroPress (because why not?). Some of this is marketing. Some's a real improvement—or at least an alternate vision for an already quirky coffee maker.\nHere's our best advice on which version of AeroPress to get, and our favorite accessories from AeroPress and other makers.\nBe sure to check out our other coffee guides, including the Best Coffee Grinders, Best Drip Coffee Makers, Best Coffee Bean Subscriptions, and Best Espresso Machines.\nUpdated April 2025: We’ve added the AeroPress Premium, Fellow Prismo, AeroPress Travel Filter Holder, AeroPress Stainless Steel Filter, Hexnub Bamboo Organizer, and Coffeesock wool filters. We’ve also retested previous AeroPress devices, and updated links and prices throughout. The original version of this guide was written by WIRED contributor Joe Ray.\nBest AeroPress Overall\nThe WIRED team has long admired AeroPress. Reporter Steven Levy profiled its inventor in his Palo Alto office a decade ago, when AeroPress mania was first reaching fever pitch. But like a lot of low-cost, convenient things, the original AeroPress is made of (BPA-free, pthalate-free, certified food-safe) plastic. And microplastics are a concern that is rapidly rising in scope and importance, amid some real health questions.\nAt a bit of a price premium, the new plastic-free AeroPress Premium is the answer: a steel-and-glass AeroPress with sturdy construction and the same great ability to make AeroPress-style coffee. WIRED commerce director Martin Cizmar, a longtime AeroPress fan, has stowed his beloved original AeroPress with his camping gear in favor of the new Premium as a home device. Note, however, he had intermittent issues with coffee blowouts on one review sample, a “manageable quirk” he solved by using AeroPress's stainless steel filter we discuss below.\nPrettiest AeroPresses\nBeauty isn't free. It costs $10 extra. The new Clears and Colors (which are also considered Clears) are pretty much the same device as the good old-fashioned AeroPress Original. They just happen to be better-looking, brighter, more various, and slightly more expensive. Some AeroPress lovers appreciate that the Clear lets you see the brewing process—though if I'm going to be honest, coffee slurry isn't exactly a fireworks show. The real benefit of the new designs is that you get to choose a color that matches your shirt, your kitchen decor, or your whole vibe.\nBest Budget Classic\nIf you’re a longtime AeroPress owner, chances are this is the one you've got. You probably feel nostalgic and deeply attached, and rightly so. That said, the original Original AeroPress color was actually clear. This “smoked” color was added in 2010 to reduce perception of coffee staining, back when AeroPress was made with a different material. Now, this smokiness has evolved into a design hallmark. Amid the proliferation of AeroPress sizes and colors, the Original's design has remained mostly unchanged for 15 years. And these days it's $10 cheaper than the newer bright-colored and clear AeroPresses, which work the exact same way. Buying the Original marks you as a practical person who cares not for frippery.\nBest for Frequent Fliers\nThe travel-friendly 8-ounce Go (9/10 WIRED Recommends) is, on the one hand, just a slightly smaller AeroPress. On the other, says WIRED contributor Joe Ray, it's an “ingenious” upgrade he may prefer to the original, nestling inside a mug for easy transport to a campsite or a hotel. Voila: no more sad hotel K-cups. Grind whatever beans you can before heading out camping—or if you're in a new city, buy a bag and ask them to grind for AeroPress. (Although, if you really want to go for it while camping, try our favorite hand grinder, the Kingrinder K6, at a grind setting between 60 and 90 clicks.)\nAeroPress also released an updated travel AeroPress called the Go Plus ($80), but this one's a bit of a dud, according to Ray: It's made for an insulated travel mug whose magnetic slider makes it unpleasant to drink from. The Go Plus is also too small to use with standard-sized mugs at home, limiting its use case considerably. Stick with the standard Go.\nBest for (Really) Big Boys\nAeroPress fans have been clamoring for a bigger version of the classic brewer for years, mostly because the Original's 10-ounce capacity means that making coffee for more than one person can be a pain in the butt. Those fans got their wish with a model that's twice the size of the original. But bigger does not seem to be better. In fact, bigger seems a little more dangerous. While the Original, Clear, and Go all use the same size cap and filter, each piece of the XL is larger. It has its own filters, and you brew into the carafe it comes with, because the XL’s larger diameter makes it too big to brew directly into most mugs. It also gains a lot of height. With the plunger extended and connected to the barrel, and all of that sitting on the carafe, it's 19 inches high. In our testing, 5'3\" Seattle barista Reyna Callejo from Olympia Coffee Roasting Company stood on a stool to get it to work, a balancing act involving hot liquids you likely will not want to be doing before your morning coffee, or ever, really. Using the inverted method also feels more perilous—that's half a liter of hot water you're perching high above your countertop, legs, and private parts. If you really love AeroPress, want an extra cup's worth every time you brew, and aren't put off by the potential perils, go for it, but most of us who crave more coffee would likely be better off with a different kind of brewer. —Joe Ray\nPut a Lid on It?\nThe Fellow Prismo, originally released in 2020, was a revelation, though not for the reason it was advertised. The big idea is that by replacing the standard filter cap with a cap outfitted with a pressure-actuated valve, you can pave the way to make actual espresso with your AeroPress. You do this by grinding your coffee finer and then pushing really, really hard on the plunger. In practice, this is a little bit of hooey. Your arm is not creating the nine bars of pressure required to produce espresso, no matter how hard you lean. But by grinding fine, using less water, and pushing the brew through the tiny holes of the Prismo's stainless steel filter, you can indeed make a strong and espresso-like substance with some crema. It's a bit more astringent than espresso, to my taste. But here we are.\nFor me, what made the Prismo terrific was that its valve fixed the slow leak through the AeroPress's standard filter cap. The standard version dribbles a bit while steeping, causing aficionados to do weird stuff like brew “inverted,” and then flip over a column filled with boiling hot liquid before plunging. The Prismo avoids the need for such early morning adrenaline, and also stops your precious elixir from dribbling into your mug before you plunge the AeroPress. I pretty much exclusively use the Prismo or AeroPress's flow control cap, for this precise reason. And though the stainless steel filter is required for the Prismo to work, you can add a paper filter atop it for more clarity of flavor.\nAeroPress now has its own version of flow-control filter cap called, catchily, a “Flow Control Filter Cap.” The original flow control had a tendency to leak, according to some online reports, but AeroPress seems to have fixed this issue in the meantime: I have not had the problem. The Flow Control Cap costs the same as the Prismo, and both are equally successful at stopping the AeroPress from leaking before its time. So the main difference between AeroPress's and Fellow's filter cap is as follows: The Prismo comes with a stainless steel filter at the same price, but also requires that you use the steel filter. (The rubber O-ring on Prismo's steel filter stops the device from leaking.) So if you like a stainless steel filter? Use the Prismo. If not, roll with AeroPress's version.\nAlso, here's a tip for those who can't figure out how to expel coffee pucks using the Prismo or Flow Control without making a mess. Pull back the plunger a little after brewing. This will create a vacuum and suck the coffee puck back up with it. Then remove the filter cap, and plunge out the coffee puck into the bin. You're welcome.\nFiltered Results\nAeroPress makes reusable steel filters in multiple colors as an alternative to disposable paper filters. Some people pitch this as an environmental decision, in reducing waste. But given that paper filters are small, and you're using water and soap to rinse coffee oils off this steel filter, it's all likely a bit of a wash (see what I did there?). The real difference is preference and flavor. The steel filter will offer body that's a bit more like French press, with more coffee fines and oils in the coffee, but to some (including me) the flavor will taste more diffuse or muddy. The steel filter will also give you a bit of satisfying crema if you push fine coffee through it with the Prismo or Flow Control Cap. The standard paper filters will offer more clarity of flavor and remove all sediment and a lot of the coffee, but won't have the body of the steel-filtered stuff. But note for the heart-conscious: Studies going back decades show that unfiltered coffee contains chemicals called diterpenes that are associated with a significant increase in LDL cholesterol. Paper filters have been shown to remove these chemicals. Steel filters have not.\nAnother theoretically environmentally friendly option is cotton-wool filters, not unlike the filter used in the classic Toddy to make cold brew. An Austin, Texas, company called CoffeeSock makes reusable woolen filters for cold brew, pour-over, AeroPress, you name it. A three-pack goes for $15. I didn't overwhelmingly like the flavor I got using woolen filters on my AeroPress—it was a little muddy-tasting, and maybe even a little gym-socky—and it's a lot of work rinsing and drying and basically doing laundry on my coffee filter. But maybe you'll like it more than I did.\nThe Best AeroPress Caddy\nThe AeroPress is both a remarkably simple coffee device and a device with a lot of funny little parts. There's a scoop if you're a scooping type, a funnel if you're a grinder and pourer, a tamper if you like to mix up your AeroPress while it brews. There are filters. There's a filter cap, and maybe your alternate valve-modulated filter cap. Thank goodness for Hexnub, a British company founded by former F1 racing gearheads, which makes by far the most compact and downright handsomest solution I've found. This little bamboo caddy sits nicely on a countertop, with slots for an AeroPress and all the . It sports equally handsome little silicone mats to catch stray liquid. AeroPress makes its own stainless steel countertop organizer ($100) for its devices, if you'd rather a cyberpunk vibe.\nTaking the Case\nEach AeroPress used to come with a little vertical stand for your filters. This is no longer true. Instead, this compact little travel case is sold separately. Do you need a little filter-holder? I dunno. But it doesn't cost a lot, it's compact if you're taking the AeroPress on the go, and it looks undeniably nicer than a ziplock baggie. It also removes the chance you splash all your paper filters with water from your sink. What I can say is that I'm a little happier now that I have it.\nWhen You’re Having Funnel\nThis is a funnel. It also used to come with the AeroPress but no longer does. If you pour fresh-ground coffee into your AeroPress rather than scooping, you'll probably appreciate having this. It's also nice for not spilling water while pouring rom a kettle. Funnels are nice for not spilling stuff, in general. A few companies make knockoffs, but the ones we've seen aren't even cheaper than the one from AeroPress. And this funnel says “AeroPress” on it, which is classier.",

Famously created by a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/03/first-alan-adler-invented-the-aerobie-now-hes-created-the-perfect-cup-of-coffee/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford-educated inventor previously known for improving the aerodynamics of the flying disc</a>, each AeroPress looks a bit like a fat syringe that injects brewed coffee through a filter and into your waiting mug. It doesn't seem like it should make coffee as good as it does. And yet it does, attaining a result somewhere between French press, espresso, and filter coffee. Feel free to follow the recipe on the box. But the device also allows a remarkable amount of control over your coffee as you adjust grind, brewing time, agitation, bloom, and filter of choice.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">The AeroPress has inspired <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://aeroprecipe.com/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://aeroprecipe.com/\" href=\"https://aeroprecipe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cultish fandom</a> since its introduction in 2005, not to mention a burgeoning aftermarket of accessories and mods. And yet it took till 2019 for AeroPress to release a second model, a slightly smaller travel version called the AeroPress Go (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/aeropress-go/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">9/10, WIRED Recommends</a>). After equity company Tiny Capital acquired a majority stake in AeroPress in 2021, the portal to the AeroPress multiverse was thrown open. Aeropress now makes alternate filters, flow-control caps, gadget organizers, and a hot pink AeroPress (because why not?). Some of this is marketing. Some's a real improvement—or at least an alternate vision for an already quirky coffee maker.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Here's our best advice on which version of AeroPress to get, and our favorite accessories from AeroPress and other makers.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Be sure to check out our other coffee guides, including the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-coffee-grinders/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Coffee Grinders</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-coffee-makers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Drip Coffee Makers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-coffee-subscriptions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Coffee Bean Subscriptions</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-espresso-machines/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Espresso Machines</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><em>Updated April 2025: We’ve added the AeroPress Premium, Fellow Prismo, AeroPress Travel Filter Holder, AeroPress Stainless Steel Filter, Hexnub Bamboo Organizer, and Coffeesock wool filters.

WIRED team has long admired AeroPress.

But like a lot of low-cost, convenient things, the original AeroPress is made of (BPA-free, pthalate-free, certified food-safe) plastic. And microplastics are a concern that is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-microplastic-crisis-is-getting-exponentially-worse/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rapidly rising in scope and importance</a>, amid some <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00405-8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">real health questions</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">At a bit of a price premium, the new plastic-free AeroPress Premium is the answer: a steel-and-glass AeroPress with sturdy construction and the same great ability to make AeroPress-style coffee. WIRED commerce director Martin Cizmar, a longtime AeroPress fan, has stowed his beloved original AeroPress with his camping gear <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/review-aeropress-premium-coffee-press/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in favor of the new Premium as a home device</a>. Note, however, he had intermittent issues with coffee blowouts on one review sample, a “manageable quirk” he solved by using AeroPress's stainless steel filter we discuss below.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Prettiest AeroPresses</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Beauty isn't free. It costs $10 extra. The new Clears and Colors (which are also considered Clears) are pretty much the same device as the good old-fashioned AeroPress Original. They just happen to be better-looking, brighter, more various, and slightly more expensive. Some AeroPress lovers appreciate that the Clear lets you see the brewing process—though if I'm going to be honest, coffee slurry isn't exactly a fireworks show. The real benefit of the new designs is that you get to choose a color that matches your shirt, your kitchen decor, or your whole vibe.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Best Budget Classic</h2><div

You probably feel nostalgic and deeply attached, and rightly so. That said, the original Original AeroPress color was actually clear. This “smoked” color was added in 2010 to reduce perception of coffee staining, back when AeroPress was made with a different material. Now, this smokiness has evolved into a design hallmark. Amid the proliferation of AeroPress sizes and colors, the Original's design has remained mostly unchanged for 15 years. And these days it's $10 cheaper than the newer bright-colored and clear AeroPresses, which work the exact same way. Buying the Original marks you as a practical person who cares not for frippery.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Best for Frequent Fliers</h2><div class=\"CalloutFeatureLargeWrapper-cAQNly bLNMaC\"

The Go Plus is also too small to use with standard-sized mugs at home, limiting its use case considerably. Stick with the standard Go.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"></h2><h2 class=\"paywall\">Best for (Really) Big Boys</h2><p class=\"paywall\">AeroPress fans have been clamoring for a bigger version of the classic brewer for years, mostly because the Original's 10-ounce capacity means that making coffee for more than one person can be a pain in the butt. Those fans got their wish with a model that's twice the size of the original. But bigger does not seem to be better. In fact, bigger seems a little more dangerous. While the Original, Clear, and Go all use the same size cap and filter, each piece of the XL is larger. It has its own filters, and you brew into the carafe it comes with, because the XL’s larger diameter makes it too big to brew directly into most mugs. It also gains a lot of height. With the plunger extended and connected to the barrel, and all of that sitting on the carafe, it's 19 inches high. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/aeropress-xl/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In our testing</a>, 5'3\" Seattle barista Reyna Callejo from Olympia Coffee Roasting Company stood on a stool to get it to work, a balancing act involving hot liquids you likely will not want to be doing before your morning coffee, or ever, really. Using the inverted method also feels more perilous—that's half a liter of hot water you're perching high above your countertop, legs, and private parts. If you really love AeroPress, want an extra cup's worth every time you brew, and aren't put off by the potential perils, go for it, but most of us who crave more coffee would likely be better off with a different kind of brewer. —<em>Joe Ray</em></p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Put a Lid on It?</h2><p class=\"paywall\">The Fellow Prismo, originally released in 2020, was a revelation, though not for the reason it was advertised. The big idea is that by replacing the standard filter cap with a cap outfitted with a pressure-actuated valve, you can pave the way to make actual espresso with your AeroPress. You do this by grinding your coffee finer and then pushing really, really hard on the plunger. In practice, this is a little bit of hooey. Your arm is not creating the nine bars of pressure required to produce espresso, no matter how hard you lean. But by grinding fine, using less water, and pushing the brew through the tiny holes of the Prismo's stainless steel filter, you can indeed make a strong and espresso-like substance with some crema. It's a bit more astringent than espresso, to my taste. But here we are.</p><p class=\"paywall\">For me, what made the Prismo terrific was that its valve fixed the slow leak through the AeroPress's standard filter cap. The standard version dribbles a bit while steeping, causing aficionados to do weird stuff like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1B55ba-kLA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">brew “inverted,” and then flip over a column filled with boiling hot liquid</a> before plunging. The Prismo avoids the need for such early morning adrenaline, and also stops your precious elixir from dribbling into your mug before you plunge the AeroPress. I pretty much exclusively use the Prismo or AeroPress's flow control cap, for this precise reason. And though the stainless steel filter is required for the Prismo to work, you can add a paper filter atop it for more clarity of flavor.</p><div class=\"CalloutFeatureLargeWrapper-cAQNly bLNMaC\"

Control Filter Cap.” The original flow control had a tendency to leak, according to some online reports, but AeroPress seems to have fixed this issue in the meantime: I have not had the problem. The Flow Control Cap costs the same as the Prismo, and both are equally successful at stopping the AeroPress from leaking before its time. So the main difference between AeroPress's and Fellow's filter cap is as follows: The Prismo comes with a stainless steel filter at the same price, but also <em>requires</em> that you use the steel filter. (The rubber O-ring on Prismo's steel filter stops the device from leaking.) So if you like a stainless steel filter? Use the Prismo. If not, roll with AeroPress's version.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Also, here's a tip for those who can't figure out how to expel coffee pucks using the Prismo or Flow Control without making a mess. Pull back the plunger a little after brewing. This will create a vacuum and suck the coffee puck back up with it. Then remove the filter cap, and plunge out the coffee puck into the bin. You're welcome.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Filtered Results</h2><div class=\"CalloutFeatureLargeWrapper-cAQNly bLNMaC\" data-testid=\"feature-large-callout\"><div class=\"UnifiedProductCardBody-hIYvDT

disposable paper filters. Some people pitch this as an environmental decision, in reducing waste. But given that paper filters are small, and you're using water and soap to rinse coffee oils off this steel filter, it's all likely a bit of a wash (see what I did there?). The real difference is preference and flavor. The steel filter will offer body that's a bit more like French press, with more coffee fines and oils in the coffee, but to some (including me) the flavor will taste more diffuse or muddy. The steel filter will also give you a bit of satisfying crema if you push fine coffee through it with the Prismo or Flow Control Cap. The standard paper filters will offer more clarity of flavor and remove all sediment and a lot of the coffee, but won't have the body of the steel-filtered stuff. But note for the heart-conscious: Studies <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2000/02/coffee-is-your-friend/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">going back decades</a> show that unfiltered coffee contains chemicals called diterpenes that are associated with a significant increase in LDL cholesterol. Paper filters have been shown to remove these chemicals.

AeroPress used to come with a little vertical stand for your filters. This is no longer true. Instead, this compact little travel case is sold separately. Do you need a little filter-holder? I dunno. But it doesn't cost a lot, it's compact if you're taking the AeroPress on the go, and it looks undeniably nicer than a ziplock baggie. It also removes the chance you splash all your paper filters with water from your sink. What I can say is that I'm a little happier now that I have it.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">When You’re Having Funnel</h2><div class=\"CalloutFeatureLargeWrapper-cAQNly bLNMaC\"

It also used to come with the AeroPress but no longer does. If you pour fresh-ground coffee into your AeroPress rather than scooping, you'll probably appreciate having this. It's also nice for not spilling water while pouring rom a kettle. Funnels are nice for not spilling stuff, in general. A few companies make knockoffs, but the ones we've seen aren't even cheaper than the one from AeroPress. And this funnel says “AeroPress” on it, which is classier.</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nMost people don't associate Skullcandy—known for its plasticky skull-and-crossbones aesthetic—with premium audio. Skullcandy admitted as much at a launch event this week in New York City. Since its inception in 2003, it has aimed at (and impressively captured) the wallets of cash-strapped suburban punks across America with low prices, punchy colors, heavy bass, and skulls.\nThat's why its new $100 noise-canceling headphones are both exciting and ironic—they're made in collaboration with Bose, a company known best as the business-class choice for the parents of Skullcandy kids. The Method 360 ANC offer similar noise canceling to the Bose QuietComfort Ultra in a similar design, but with a larger charging case (good for 32 hours of battery life with ANC on) and slightly larger earbuds. It’s a “we’ll dumb this down for Junior” approach that I'd love to see employed more in affordable products.\nIn my limited time with the headphones so far, I've been impressed with the noise canceling and audio quality, even with stiff competition from Google, JLab, and others in the sub-$100 space. They have multipoint pairing and a nine-hour battery life with ANC on, which is excellent for a full day of work. The one downside? Putting the buds back in the charging case is a bit of a pain at first—for whatever reason, they snap magnetically into the case upside down. That’s not much of a deal-breaker to me, and I look forward to more testing before our upcoming review.\nAlongside the Method 360 ANC, available now for $100, the company unveiled several other new audio products at its NYC event set to arrive throughout the year, from the Crusher 540 Active workout headphones to the revived Aviator 900 ANC and open-earbud Push 720 Open. Oh, and Tony Hawk was there—he's the brand ambassador for the new Method 360. —Parker Hall\nA Keyboard That Won’t Let You Force Quit\nIf you’ve ever longed to join the Macrodata Refinement team at Lumon Industries, you'll be excited to hear that Atomic Keyboard has unveiled a real-life limited edition Severance keyboard. Called the MDR Dasher, this mechanical keyboard is modeled after the Data General Dasher 200 terminal from the late ‘70s, the same unit that inspired the show’s production design team.\nThere’s no Escape, Control, or Option keys—because, well, there is no escape. It’s a cold grid of 73 chunky keys with a 70 percent keyboard layout. The bulky, aluminum case is dressed in shades of industrial blue, with an off-white frame that looks like it’s been sitting in a forgotten department since the ’80s. Instead of a mouse pad, there’s a tactile trackball beside a cross-shaped directional pad.\nThere’s no practical need for a keyboard like this in 2025, but it’s a cheeky collector’s item for fans of the Apple TV+ series. The MDR Dasher will be compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux via USB-C. Atomic Keyboard isn't clear on the price yet (it says $399, but the price is crossed off, and it notes that final pricing is to be determined), and there's no release date, but you can sign up for email alerts on its site. —Boutayna Chokrane\nApple Will Train Its AI on User Data\nThis week, Apple says it will begin analyzing user data to improve its artificial intelligence models, a move widely seen as a means for the company to catch up to rivals like OpenAI and Google. Instead of relying on synthetic training models, Apple will use anonymized customer data to check the work of its synthetic data and improve it. The data is aggregated, so Apple isn't collecting emails or texts but instead tracking “trends in real user data” to compare with results from synthetic data. It only applies to users who have opted in to Device Analytics and will roll out in iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and macOS 15.5.\nThis will upgrade the quality of artificial-intelligence text-generation features like Writing Tools and summarizations, though it's unclear how quickly we'll see improvements. Apple's new-and-improved Siri was supposed to be here by now—a part of the broader Apple Intelligence rollout—but instead we're left with a marginally souped-up Siri that can tap into OpenAI's ChatGPT. That's about it. A few weeks ago, the company delayed the version of Siri it promised last year, one that can understand your personal context. It's now expected to arrive in 2026.\nA Laser-Powered Skin-Care Tool Arrives in the US\nThe Lyma Laser Pro has officially launched in the US this week for a cool $5,995. First released in Europe last year, the at-home, FDA-cleared skin-care tool has racked up a wait list of over 16,000 Americans, which the company says translates to more than $100 million in sales.\nWhat does it do? The Laser Pro uses near-infrared cold laser technology to boost collagen production to address wrinkles, cellulite, redness, scarring, hyperpigmentation, and post-surgical recovery. Triple the size and power of the original Lyma Laser, the Pro delivers a continuous 808-nanometer laser beam at 1,450 milliwatts—deep enough to penetrate 10 centimeters into the dermis. Lyma claims visible results in 30 days if you stick to three minutes a day. What’s more fascinating is that, unlike LED light therapy, this laser works over sun protection factor (SPF) or makeup without (supposedly) losing efficacy. I’m currently testing it—stay tuned for the full review. —Boutayna Chokrane\nComcast Has a Price-Lock Guarantee\nA few weeks ago, Verizon announced a three-year price lock for customers, citing rising prices in a challenging economic climate. Now, Comcast is following suit. This week, the company announced a five-year price guarantee if you subscribe to a new Xfinity Internet package, which includes a Wi-Fi router/modem and unlimited data, starting at $55 per month and going up to $105 depending on the plan. That also includes a free Xfinity Mobile line for one year. Comcast claims there's no annual contract, so you're free to cancel it at any time with no penalty.\nLike all of these price lock initiatives, there are caveats. It applies only to new residential customers, and you're limited to 400 Mbps internet. You have to enroll in paperless billing and autopay or you'll pay extra, and there could be equipment-installation and other fees. If you downgrade the service, regular rates will apply. The promotion ends June 23.\nBeats Now Makes USB-C Cables\nBeats is getting into the cable business. Announced this week, the Apple-owned brand is launching Beats Cables, including USB-A to USB-C, USB-C to USB-C, and USB-C to Lightning varieties. The reinforced cables come in a 20-cm size in Bolt Black (AKA black) as well as 1.5 meters in signature Beats colors like Surge Stone, Nitro Navy, and Rapid Red (available this summer). The stylish cables provide data transfer at USB 2.0 rates and fast charging at up to 60 watts for the USB-C version, or 15 watts for the USB-A to USB-C cable. They’re available now at Beats' site and Apple’s site and stores, starting at $19 for a single or $35 for a two-pack. —Ryan Waniata",

    "content_text": "This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nThe summer of 2021 was brutal for residents of the Pacific Northwest. Cities across the region from Portland, Oregon, to Quillayute, Washington, broke temperature records by several degrees. In Washington, as the searing heat wave settled over the state, 125 people died from heat-related illnesses such as strokes and heart attacks, making it the deadliest weather event in the state’s history.\nAs officials recognized the heat wave’s disproportionate effect on low-income and unhoused people unable to access air-conditioning, they made a crucial change to the state’s energy assistance program. Since the early 1980s, states, tribes, and territories have received funds each year to help low-income people pay their electricity bills and install energy-efficiency upgrades through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. Congress appropriates funds for the program, and the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, doles it out to states in late fall. Until the summer of 2021, the initiative primarily provided heating assistance during Washington’s cold winter months. But that year, officials expanded the program to cover cooling expenses.\nLast year, Congress appropriated $4.1 billion for the effort, and HHS disbursed 90 percent of the funds. But the program is now in jeopardy.\nEarlier this month, HHS, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., laid off 10,000 employees, including the roughly dozen or so people tasked with running LIHEAP. The agency was supposed to send out an additional $378 million this year, but those funds are now stuck in federal coffers without the staff needed to move the money out.\nLIHEAP helps roughly 6 million people survive freezing winters and blistering summers, many of whom face greater risks now that the year’s warm season has already brought unusually high temperatures. Residents of Phoenix are expected to have their first 100-degree high any day now.\n“We’re seeing the warm-weather states really coming up short with the funding necessary to assist people in the summer with extreme heat,” said one of the HHS employees who worked on the LIHEAP program and was recently laid off. Losing the people that ran the program is “absolutely devastating,” they said, because agency staff helped states and tribes understand the flexibilities in the program to serve people effectively, assistance that became extremely important with increasingly erratic weather patterns across the country.\nIn typical years, once Congress appropriates LIHEAP funds, HHS distributes the money in the fall in time for the colder months. States and other entities then make critical decisions about how much they spend during the winter and how much they save for the summer.\nThe need for LIHEAP funds has always been greater than what has been available. Only about 1 in 5 households that meet the program’s eligibility requirements receive funds. As a result, states often run out of money by the summer. At least a quarter of LIHEAP grant recipients run out of money at some point during the year, the former employee said.\n“That remaining 10 percent would be really important to establish cooling assistance during the hot summer months, which is increasingly important,” said Katrina Metzler, executive director of the National Energy and Utility Affordability Coalition, a group of nonprofits and utilities that advances the needs of low-income people. “If LIHEAP were to disappear, people would die in their homes. That’s the most critical issue. It saves people.”\nIn addition to Washington, many other states have expanded their programs to provide both heating and cooling programs. Arizona, Texas, and Oregon now offer year-round cooling assistance.\nHHS staff plays a crucial role in running LIHEAP. They assess how much each state, tribe, and territory will receive. They set rules for how the money could be used. They audit local programs to ensure funds are being spent as intended. All that may now be lost.\nBut according to Metzler, there are some steps that HHS could take to ensure that the program continues to be administered as Congress intended. First, and most obvious, the agency could reinstate those who were fired. Short of that, the agency could move the program to another department within HHS or contract out the responsibilities.\nBut ultimately, Metzler continued, LIHEAP funds need to be distributed so those in need can access it. “Replacing the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program is a nearly impossible task,” she said. States “can’t have enough bake sales to replace” it.",

Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security has been sending aggressive emails telling people with temporary legal status to leave the US. It is unclear who has actually been sent the messages, though, given that a number of people who are US-born citizens have reported receiving them.\nThe US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency briefly seemed poised this week to cancel funding for the critical software vulnerability tracking project known as the CVE Program.

The bill advanced unanimously from committee this week and will now go to the state Senate for a vote. If passed, the Social Media Use by Minors bill, which is sponsored by state senator Blaise Ingoglia, would require “social media platforms to provide a mechanism to decrypt end-to-end encryption when law enforcement obtains a subpoena.” The bill would also ban disappearing messages in accounts designed for children and would require social media companies to create a mechanism for parents or guardians to access children's accounts. Experts have long warned that encryption backdoors make everyone less secure, including those they are intended to help. Yet waves of attacks on encryption have repeatedly emerged over the years, including a recent trend in the European Union and United Kingdom.\nJudge Finds Broad Searches of Cell Tower Data Are Unconstitutional\nA Nevada district judge said this week that the practice of “tower dumps,” in which law enforcement pulls vast quantities of personal caller data from cell towers, violates the Fourth Amendment and is, thus, unconstitutional. Cell towers collect large quantities of information about users, including phone numbers and phone locations, so when cops request data from a tower during a specific time period, they often receive information on thousands of devices or more. In spite of the decision this week, though, Judge Miranda M. Du said that law enforcement could still use the evidence they had collected through a tower dump in their case.\nChina Hits US With Accusations of Cyberattacks, Naming Alleged NSA Agents\nChina claimed this week that the US National Security Agency perpetrated “advanced” cyberattacks against critical industries in February during the Asian Winter Games. Law enforcement from the northeastern city of Harbin put three alleged NSA agents—Katheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson—on a wanted list and claimed that the University of California and Virginia Tech were involved in the attacks. “We urge the US to take a responsible attitude on the issue of cyber security and … stop unprovoked smears and attacks on China,” ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said during a news briefing about multiple topics, according to Reuters. The US government frequently calls out Chinese state-backed hacking and names individual alleged perpetrators, but China has been less consistent about such statements. The move this week comes amid escalating tensions between the two countries, including the Trump's administration's trade war.\nUS Customs and Border Protection Is Using a Number of AI Tools to Monitor Social Media\nCBP is using multiple artificial intelligence tools to scan social media and identify people of interest online, according to information from the agency and marketing materials reviewed by 404 Media from the contractors. CBP released information about the platforms this week in parallel to the US Department of Homeland Security’s announcement that it will “begin screening aliens’ social media activity for Antisemitism.” That statement also says that US Citizenship and Immigration Services is conducting “antisemitism” social media searches. CBP told 404 Media in an email that “neither tool is used for vetting or travel application processing,” referring to Dataminr and Onyx, but did not elaborate beyond that. The platforms use AI to parse large troves of data and can be used to develop leads on people who may be in violation of US immigration laws.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nWomen's sports bras were the bane of my teen existence. Few things are as humbling as struggling to wriggle out of a sweaty one post-workout. I've contorted, clawed, nearly dislocated a shoulder—and I once triggered what I can only describe as a sports bra-induced locked jaw. They were too tight, flattened my chest (and soul), and, on a bad day, gave me a decent dose of body image issues.\nSomewhere between my fourth fitness renaissance and the realization that I hadn't worn a regular bra since pre-pandemic, I became a convert. After years of trial and error, I discovered the bra styles that worked (thank goodness for adjustable straps). Now I wear them to work, to work out, and sometimes to do absolutely nothing at all.\nThe right sports bra should be soft but structured, snug but breathable, and—for me—cute enough to pass as a top, like the Vuori AllTheFeels bra ($58). After testing dozens over the past few months—during runs, lifts, rides, and flows—I found the best sports bras worth your attention.\nFor more activewear recommendations, check out our guides to the Best Leggings, Best Running Shoes, and Best Barefoot Shoes.\n|Next Up\n|I'll be testing the Lululemon Energy Longline Bra for $58, Brooks 3 Pocket Sports Bra for $55, and Title Nine Cuz She Says So Underwire Sports Bra for $65.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

That’s why this racerback sports bra is a remarkable feat—I have many merino wool bras, but none of them retain their shape and offer as much support as this one, although I should note here that I’m a 34A, so in my case, the claims of good support are not being tested as thoroughly as they might with other people.</p><p>Branwyn’s sports bra is made from a blend of 76 percent merino, 14 percent nylon, and 10 percent elastane. The fabric itself is knit in a seamless, compressive, 4-way knit structure, so there are no seams to rub or chafe. I wear it mostly rock climbing, without a shirt, and it’s long enough on my short torso for it to not be <em>totally</em> obvious that I’m only wearing a bra (I think). Moreover, it’s BPA-, PFAS- and forever-chemical-free, which I prefer for garments that I wear close to my skin. There are sleeves for removable bra pads, but they’re not included, and it’s dark and thick enough that I don’t worry about anything showing anyway. My only caveat is that since it’s heavier than almost any other sports bra I own, it also takes longer to dry, both on the line and on my body. <em>—Adrienne So</em></p><p><em><strong>Materials:</strong> 76 percent extra fine merino wool, 14 percent nylon, and 10 percent elastane</em></p><p><em><strong>Size Range:</strong> XS through XXL</em></p></div></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Operatives from Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are building a master database at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that could track and surveil undocumented immigrants, two sources with direct knowledge tell WIRED.\nDOGE is knitting together immigration databases from across DHS and uploading data from outside agencies including the Social Security Administration (SSA), as well as voting records, sources say. This, experts tell WIRED, could create a system that could later be searched to identify and surveil immigrants.\nThe scale at which DOGE is seeking to interconnect data, including sensitive biometric data, has never been done before, raising alarms with experts who fear it may lead to disastrous privacy violations for citizens, certified foreign workers, and undocumented immigrants.\nA United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data lake, or centralized repository, existed at DHS prior to DOGE that included data related to immigration cases, like requests for benefits, supporting evidence in immigration cases, and whether an application has been received and is pending, approved, or denied. Since at least mid-March, however, DOGE has been uploading mass amounts of data to this preexisting USCIS data lake, including data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), SSA, and voting data from Pennsylvania and Florida, two DHS sources with direct knowledge tell WIRED.\n“They are trying to amass a huge amount of data,” a senior DHS official tells WIRED. “It has nothing to do with finding fraud or wasteful spending … They are already cross-referencing immigration with SSA and IRS as well as voter data.”\nSince president Donald Trump’s return to the White House earlier this year, WIRED and other outlets have reported extensively on DOGE’s attempts to gain unprecedented access to government data, but until recently little has been publicly known about the purpose of such requests or how they would be processed. Reporting from The New York Times and The Washington Post has made clear that one aim is to cross-reference datasets and leverage access to sensitive SSA systems to effectively cut immigrants off from participating in the economy, which the administration hopes would force them to leave the county. The scope of DOGE’s efforts to support the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown appear to be far broader than this, though. Among other things, it seems to involve centralizing immigrant-related data from across the government to surveil, geolocate, and track targeted immigrants in near real time.\nDHS and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nDOGE’s collection of personal data on immigrants around the US has dovetailed with the Trump administration’s continued immigration crackdown. “Our administration will not rest until every single violent illegal alien is removed from our country,” Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, said in a press conference on Tuesday.\nOn Thursday, Gerald Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia and ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to the SSA office of the inspector general stating that representatives have spoken with an agency whistleblower who has warned them that DOGE was building a “master database” containing SSA, IRS, and HHS data.\n“The committee is in possession of multiple verifiable reports showing that DOGE has exfiltrated sensitive government data across agencies for unknown purposes,” a senior oversight committee aide claims to WIRED. “Also concerning, a pattern of technical malfeasance has emerged, showing these DOGE staffers are not abiding by our nation’s privacy and cybersecurity laws and their actions are more in line with tactics used by adversaries waging an attack on US government systems. They are using excessive and unprecedented system access to intentionally cover their tracks and avoid oversight so they can creep on Americans’ data from the shadows.”\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at makenakelly.32 and Vittoria89.82.\n“There's a reason these systems are siloed,” says Victoria Noble, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “When you put all of an agency's data into a central repository that everyone within an agency or even other agencies can access, you end up dramatically increasing the risk that this information will be accessed by people who don't need it and are using it for improper reasons or repressive goals, to weaponize the information, use it against people they dislike, dissidents, surveil immigrants or other groups.”\nOne of DOGE’s primary hurdles to creating a searchable data lake has been obtaining access to agency data. Even within an agency like DHS, there are several disparate pools of data across ICE, USCIS, Customs and Border Protection, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). Though some access is shared, particularly for law enforcement purposes, these pools have not historically been commingled by default because the data is only meant to be used for specific purposes, experts tell WIRED. ICE and HSI, for instance, are law enforcement bodies and sometimes need court orders to access an individual's information for criminal investigations, whereas USCIS collects sensitive information as part of the regular course of issuing visas and green cards.\nDOGE operatives Edward Coristine, Kyle Schutt, Aram Moghaddassi, and Payton Rehling have already been granted access to systems at USCIS, FedScoop reported earlier this month. The USCIS databases contain information on refugees and asylum seekers and possibly data on green card holders, naturalized US citizens, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients, a DHS source familiar tells WIRED.\nDOGE wants to upload information to the data lake from myUSCIS, the online portal where immigrants can file petitions, communicate with USCIS, view their application history, and respond to requests for evidence supporting their case, two DHS sources with direct knowledge tell WIRED. In combination with IP address information from immigrants that sources tell WIRED that DOGE also wants, this data could be used to aid in geolocating undocumented immigrants, experts say.\nVoting data, at least from Pennsylvania and Florida, appears to also have also been uploaded to the USCIS data lake. In the case of Pennsylvania, two DHS sources tell WIRED that it is being joined with biometric data from USCIS’s Customer Profile Management System, identified on the DHS’s website as a “person-centric repository of biometric and associated biographic information provided by applicants, petitioners, requestors, and beneficiaries” who have been “issued a secure card or travel document identifying the receipt of an immigration benefit.”\n“DHS, for good reason, has always been very careful about sharing data,” says a former DHS staff member who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. “Seeing this change is very jarring. The systemization of it all is what gets scary, in my opinion, because it could allow the government to go after real or perceived enemies or ‘aliens; ‘enemy aliens.’”\nWhile government agencies frequently share data, this process is documented and limited to specific purposes, according to experts. Still, the consolidation appears to have administration buy-in: On March 20, President Trump signed an executive order requiring all federal agencies to facilitate “both the intra- and inter-agency sharing and consolidation of unclassified agency records.” DOGE officials and Trump administration agency leaders have also suggested centralizing all government data into one single repository. “As you think about the future of AI, in order to think about using any of these tools at scale, we gotta get our data in one place,\" General Services Administration acting administrator Stephen Ehikian said in a town hall meeting on March 20. In an interview with Fox News in March, Airbnb cofounder and DOGE member Joe Gebbia asserted that this kind of data sharing would create an “Apple-like store experience” of government services.\nAccording to the former staffer, it was historically “extremely hard” to get access to data that DHS already owned across its different departments. A combined data lake would “represent significant departure in data norms and policies.” But, they say, “it’s easier to do this with data that DHS controls” than to try to combine it with sensitive data from other agencies, because accessing data from other agencies can have even more barriers.\nThat hasn’t stopped DOGE operatives from spending the last few months requesting access to immigration information that was, until recently, siloed across different government agencies. According to documents filed in the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO v. Social Security Administration lawsuit on March 15, members of DOGE who were stationed at SSA requested access to the USCIS database, SAVE, a system for local and state governments, as well as the federal government, to verify a person’s immigration status.\nAccording to two DHS sources with direct knowledge, the SSA data was uploaded to the USCIS system on March 24, only nine days after DOGE received access to SSA’s sensitive government data systems. An SSA source tells WIRED that the types of information are consistent with the agency's Numident database, which is the file of information contained in a social security number application. The Numident record would include a person’s social security number, full names, birthdates, citizenship, race, ethnicity, sex, mother’s maiden name, an alien number, and more.\nOversight for the protection of this data also appears to now be more limited. In March, DHS announced cuts to the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, and the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, all key offices that were significant guards against misuse of data. “We didn't make a move in the data world without talking to the CRCL,” says the former DHS employee.\nCRCL, which investigates possible rights abuses by DHS and whose creation was mandated by Congress, had been a particular target of DOGE. According to ProPublica, in a February meeting with the CRCL team, Schutt said, “This whole program sounds like money laundering.”\nSchutt did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMusk loyalists and DOGE operatives have spoken at length about parsing government data to find instances of supposed illegal immigration. Antonio Gracias, who according to Politico is leading DOGE’s “immigration task force,” told Fox and Friends that DOGE was looking at voter data as it relates to undocumented immigrants. “Just because we were curious, we then looked to see if they were on the voter rolls,” he said. “And we found in a handful of cooperative states that there were thousands of them on the voter rolls and that many of them had voted.” (Very few noncitizens voted in the 2024 election, and naturalized immigrants were more likely to vote Republican.) Gracias is also part of the DOGE team at SSA and founded the investment firm Valor Equity Partners. He also worked with Musk for many years at Tesla and helped the centibillionaire take the company public.\n“As part of their fixation on this conspiracy theory that undocumented people are voting, they're also pulling in tens of thousands, millions of US citizens who did nothing more than vote or file for Social Security benefits,” Cody Venzke, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union focused on privacy and surveillance, tells WIRED. “It's a massive dragnet that's going to have all sorts of downstream consequences for not just undocumented people but US citizens and people who are entitled to be here as well.”\nOver the past few weeks, DOGE leadership within the IRS have orchestrated a “hackathon” aimed at plotting out a “mega API” allowing privileged users to view all agency data from a central access point. Sources tell WIRED the project will likely be hosted on Foundry, software developed by Palantir, a company cofounded by Musk ally and billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel. An API is an application programming interface that allows different software systems to exchange data. While the Treasury Department has denied the existence of a contract for this work, IRS engineers were invited to another three-day “training and building session” on the project located at Palantir’s Georgetown offices in Washington, DC, this week, according to a document viewed by WIRED.\n“Building it out as a series of APIs they can connect to is more feasible and quicker than putting all the data in a single place, which is probably what they really want,” one SSA source tells WIRED.\nOn April 5, DHS struck an agreement with the IRS to use tax data to search for more than seven million migrants working and living in the US. ICE has also recently paid Palantir millions of dollars to update and modify an ICE database focused on tracking down immigrants, 404 Media reported.\nMultiple current and former government IT sources tell WIRED that it would be easy to connect the IRS’s Palantir system with the ICE system at DHS, allowing users to query data from both systems simultaneously. A system like the one being created at the IRS with Palantir could enable near-instantaneous access to tax information for use by DHS and immigration enforcement. It could also be leveraged to share and query data from different agencies as well, including immigration data from DHS. Other DHS sub-agencies, like USCIS, use Databricks software to organize and search its data, but these could be connected to outside Foundry instances simply as well, experts say. Last month, Palantir and Databricks struck a deal making the two software platforms more interoperable.\n“I think it's hard to overstate what a significant departure this is and the reshaping of longstanding norms and expectations that people have about what the government does with their data,” says Elizabeth Laird, director of equity in civic technology at the Center for Democracy and Technology, who noted that agencies trying to match different datasets can also lead to errors. “You have false positives and you have false negatives. But in this case, you know, a false positive where you're saying someone should be targeted for deportation.”\nMistakes in the context of immigration can have devastating consequences: In March, authorities arrested and deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, due to, the Trump administration says, “an administrative error.” Still, the administration has refused to bring Abrego Garcia back, defying a Supreme Court ruling.\n“The ultimate concern is a panopticon of a single federal database with everything that the government knows about every single person in this country,” Venzke says. “What we are seeing is likely the first step in creating that centralized dossier on everyone in this country.”\nUpdated: 4/25/2025, 12:45 pm EDT: In a statement, a Treasury official said that IRS data wasn't being used 'inappropriately,' but did not dispute Wired's reporting: “Congress has been very clear about the limited exceptions in which taxpayer information can be shared. The implication that taxpayer information is being inappropriately shared across government agencies is not only incorrect but dangerous.\"",

    "content_text": "Over 1,400 employees who were about to be laid off from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will be able to keep working for at least another week after a federal judge intervened in the dismantling of the independent regulator on Friday.\nJudge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, DC, said the Trump administration could not move forward with the layoffs, which hit roughly 90 percent of the agency, until it presents more evidence about how the terminations have been carried out. The employees learned on Thursday that they were going to lose access to agency systems the following evening and their final date of employment would be June 16. Now, a hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 28. Jackson had previously issued a ruling slowing the firings of probationary employees at the CFPB in February.\nSince its establishment by Congress in 2010, the CFPB has helped consumers fight banks and other companies over dubious fees, racial discrimination in lending, and a number of scams. But some conservatives have called for the agency to be dismantled to limit the regulation of businesses, and some companies, including tech giants, have questioned its expanding oversight. This week, an agency official told staff that cases on medical debt, student loans, consumer data, and digital payments would be de-prioritized.\nGroups including the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents part of the CFPB workforce, sued the Trump administration in February in an effort to preserve the agency after its acting director, Russell Vought, sought to lay off workers and bring some projects to a stop. That prompted judge Jackson’s initial ruling calling for a pause on the initial cuts until the Trump administration provided more information. Part of her ruling was overturned by an appellate court, and the Trump administration also could appeal her order from Friday blocking the widespread layoffs.\nFor the time being, two current CFPB employees say they are continuing to work on their cases, including ongoing litigation.\nIn a court filing to Jackson on Friday, an anonymous employee said Gavin Kliger, a member of Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, managed the disputed layoffs of nearly 1,500 workers. “He kept the team up for 36 hours straight to ensure that the notices would go out yesterday (April 17),” the anonymous worker wrote. “Gavin was screaming at people he did not believe were working fast enough to ensure they could go out on this compressed timeline, calling them incompetent.”\nMark Paoletta, the agency’s chief legal officer, wrote in a separate filing on Friday that he and two other CFPB attorneys assessed “line by line” how to “right-size” the bureau. They determined that about 207 employees would be sufficient to carry out duties required by law, according to the filing, which justified laying off the rest of the agency’s roughly 1,700 employees.\n“Leadership has discovered many instances in which the Bureau’s activities have pushed well beyond the limits of the law,” Paoletta wrote, citing cases pursued “without the slightest evidence of intentional discrimination” and “into new areas beyond its jurisdiction such as peer-to-peer lending, rent-to-own, and discrimination as unfair practice.”",

    "content_text": "It’s April, and the US is experiencing a self-inflicted trade war and a constitutional crisis over immigration. It’s a lot. It’s even enough to make you forget about Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency for a while. You shouldn’t.\nTo state the obvious: DOGE is still out there, chipping away at the foundations of government infrastructure. Slightly less obvious, maybe, is that the DOGE project has recently entered a new phase. The culling of federal workers and contracts will continue, where there’s anything left to cull. But from here on out, it’s all about the data.\nFew if any entities in the world have as much access to as much sensitive data as the United States. From the start, DOGE has wanted as much of it as it could grab, and through a series of resignations, firings, and court cases, has mostly gotten its way.\nIn many cases it’s still unclear what exactly DOGE engineers have done or intend to do with that data. Despite Elon Musk’s protestations to the contrary, DOGE is as opaque as Vantablack. But recent reporting from WIRED and elsewhere begins to fill in the picture: For DOGE, data is a tool. It’s also a weapon.\nStart with the Internal Revenue Service, where DOGE associates put the agency’s best and brightest career engineers in a room with Palantir folks for a few days last week. Their mission, as WIRED previously reported, was to build a “mega API” that would make it easier to view previously compartmentalized data from across the IRS in one place.\nIn isolation that may not sound so alarming. But in theory, an API for all IRS data would make it possible for any agency—or any outside party with the right permissions, for that matter—to access the most personal, and valuable, data the US government holds about its citizens. The blurriness of DOGE’s mission begins to gain focus. Even more, since we know that the IRS is already sharing its data in unprecedented ways: A deal the agency recently signed with the Department of Homeland Security provides sensitive information about undocumented immigrants.\nIt’s black-mirror corporate synergy, putting taxpayer data in the service of President Donald Trump’s deportation crusade.\nIt also extends beyond the IRS. The Washington Post reported this week that DOGE representatives across government agencies—from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to the Social Security Administration—are putting data that is normally cordoned off in service of identifying undocumented immigrants. At the Department of Labor, as WIRED reported Friday, DOGE has gained access to sensitive data about immigrants and farm workers.\nAnd that’s just the data that stays within the government itself. This week NPR reported that a whistleblower at the National Labor Relations Board claims that staffers observed spikes in data leaving the agency after DOGE got access to its systems, with destinations unknown. The whistleblower further claims that DOGE agents appeared to take steps to “cover their tracks,” switching off or evading the monitoring tools that keep tabs on who’s doing what inside computer systems. (An NLRB spokesperson denied to NPR that DOGE had access to the agency’s systems.)\nWhat could that data be used for? Anything. Everything. A company facing a union complaint at the NLRB could, as NPR notes, get access to “damaging testimony, union leadership, legal strategies and internal data on competitors.” There’s no confirmation that it’s been used for those things—but more to the point, there’s also currently no way to know either way.\nThat’s true also of DOGE’s data aims more broadly. Right now, the target is immigration. But it has hooks into so many systems, access to so much data, interests so varied both within and without government, there are very few limits to how or where it might next be deployed.\nThe spotlight shines a little less brightly on Elon Musk these days, as more urgent calamities take the stage. But DOGE continues to work in the wings. It has tapped into the most valuable data in the world.

    "content_text": "Less than two months before the official start of hurricane season, the nation’s primary disaster-response agency faces an uncertain future. Employees working across the Federal Emergency Management Agency tell WIRED that a rapid erosion of tools, external partnerships, and practices—as well as the looming threat of staffing cuts and the exodus of senior staff—is bad news for the country as it heads into the summer, even if the agency reaches the season somewhat intact. FEMA staffers who spoke to WIRED were granted anonymity because they aren’t permitted to speak to the press.\nThe agency hasn’t seen “huge sweeping changes yet, but it doesn’t take much to completely screw a [disaster] response up,” one employee says. “We are being set up for a really, really bad situation.”\nFEMA was established in 1979 as an independent agency by an executive order signed by President Jimmy Carter; after 9/11, it was moved under the Department of Homeland Security. In recent years, expensive disasters like Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Helene, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic, have caused the agency’s spending to skyrocket.\nThe agency has long been a favorite target of conspiracy theorists. But last year, after Hurricane Helene tore through parts of North Carolina, Donald Trump, encouraged by right-wing influencers, amplified misinformation around the agency’s response to the storm, putting a political bullseye on FEMA leading into his second presidency.\nDuring his first week in office, Trump signed an executive order establishing a council to review past disasters managed by FEMA and evaluating its current ability to respond to events, with the order criticizing the agency’s “efficacy, priorities, and competence.” In late March, Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said publicly at a cabinet meeting that DHS would “eliminate FEMA.” A day later, according to reporting from Politico and The Washington Post, Noem laid out a plan to cut the agency down to just immediate disaster response by October and move it under the purview of the White House.\n“Unlike the previous administration’s unprepared, disgraceful and inadequate response to natural disasters like Hurricane Helene, the Trump administration is committed to ensuring Americans effected [sic] by emergencies will get the help they need in a quick and efficient manner,” Geoff Harbaugh, FEMA’s associate administrator of the Office of External Affairs, told WIRED in an email. “All operational and readiness requirements will continue to be managed without interruption in close coordination with local and state officials ahead of the 2025 Hurricane Season. Emergency management is best when led by local and state authorities.”\nExactly who is on the review council appointed by the White House—other than Noem and Defense secretary Pete Hegseth, cochairs appointed by the executive order—remains a mystery; some lawmakers claim to have been tapped to serve, but no public list has been published of official members. While January’s executive order requires the council to meet by April 24, the council’s only action thus far appears to be a request for public comment “to gain an understanding of [the public’s] experience with FEMA during disasters.” At the meeting in late March, CNN reported that Noem and other officials discussed the possibility of rescinding the executive order that established the council altogether. (WIRED asked FEMA for a list of council members and updates on when they plan to meet; the agency did not provide those details.)\nNearly three months into the new administration, FEMA also remains without an official leader. The acting chief administrator, Cameron Hamilton, is a former Navy SEAL with no large-scale disaster-management experience—the first FEMA leader without these qualifications since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which has prompted calls from some Democrats for an investigation into how, exactly, Hamilton got the role.\nAround 200 probationary FEMA employees—about 1 percent of staff—were cut in February, part of a massive layoff across the federal government. Since then, subsequent reductions in force have severely crippled other agencies. At Health and Human Services, for instance, thousands of employees in the CDC were fired earlier this month, wiping out entire offices in one fell swoop. It remains to be seen whether or not FEMA will experience mass firings like the recent ones at HHS.\nThose looking to make cuts at FEMA have an advantage in the structure of the agency itself, as the majority of staff are already on fixed-term or temporary contracts. The agency’s workforce is designed to be flexible, to scale up or down when needed during disasters. Almost 40 percent of FEMA’s workforce is made up of what are known as Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees, who go by the acronym CORE. CORE employees work in two- to four-year full-time contracted stints, but many stay at FEMA for years, renewing their contracts to work a variety of jobs across the agency. Reservists—a temporary workforce called upon as they’re needed—make up more than a third of the agency’s staff. Just under a quarter of FEMA’s overall staff are part-time or full-time salaried employees.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at mollytaft.76.\nAn email sent mid-April offering retirement and buyout options for FEMA—analogous to the first “fork in the road” email offering deferred resignations that was sent across the government in late January—made some crucial distinctions among staff. The email, seen by WIRED, notes specifically that CORE employees are not eligible for the deferred-resignation or early-retirement options available to other employees and offered to federal workers at other agencies.\nA separate email sent to staff in March, first reported by CBS News and seen by WIRED, instructs supervisors to submit extension requests to the secretary of Homeland Security for many types of CORE positions. “This change will apply to most FEMA positions, as two-year and four-year COREs and Reservists compose much of the workforce,” the March email reads. The agency, which is already suffering a staffing crisis, could see further cuts if most CORE employees are laid off or are simply denied for their re-extensions.\nProject 2025, the right-wing playbook for the remaking of the federal government that the Trump administration appears to be using as a blueprint for many of its policy decisions, did not explicitly call to eliminate FEMA. It did recommend severe cuts to the agency, stating a need to “shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.” In March, Trump signed another executive order that encouraged shifting the responsibility for disaster management to the states.\nBut states are now struggling with funding their basic emergency management needs which, in the offseason, include planning and preparing for future events as well as recovery from past disasters. This is thanks in large part to frozen FEMA funding, which has been caught up in a broader Office of Management and Budget directive from late January instructing agencies to temporarily pause disbursement of federal assistance to states and to review that funding to ensure it’s “consistent with the President’s policies and requirements.” Twenty-two Democratic states filed a motion for enforcement against the federal government in February, alleging that the administration’s review of funding has held up crucial FEMA funds for both disasters and state-level emergency management staff.\nA representative from Oregon’s emergency management program told WIRED that FEMA was still withholding millions of dollars in funds, including the state’s Emergency Management Performance Grant, which the state uses to pay local emergency managers. Oregon usually reimburses counties for staff salaries at the end of each quarter, but if funding continues to be frozen, the representative said, the state “will not be able to reimburse local jurisdictions.”\nLocal partnerships are also breaking down following new agency policies. Last summer, Middletown, New York, a flood-prone rural town in the Catskills, was selected to participate in a program as part of FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. FEMA representatives came out to Middletown to tour floodplain areas, vulnerable water wells, and bridges that had been impacted by floods. Town representatives began regularly meeting with FEMA to talk over grant opportunities and share expertise.\nIn mid-February, minutes before a scheduled 9 am meeting with town representatives, Middletown’s FEMA contact sent an email cancelling the call and sharing that the BRIC program had been paused. When town councilmember Robin Williams began searching for other grants to replace the federal funds, she says she realized information from FEMA designating Middletown as a specific at-risk disaster zone had been deleted from the agency’s website, just a few days after the canceled call. FEMA never reached back out to the Middletown group; Williams learned that the BRIC program was ending earlier this month from an article on the environmental news site Grist.\n“They haven’t said, ‘Hey, sorry, the program’s actually over with,’” Williams says. “They haven’t said anything.”\nAn internal FEMA communications memo seen by WIRED sent in early March instructs employees that activities—ranging from webinars to conferences to external meetings—not related to current disasters now require submitting an authorization form to get approval before staff can attend or participate.\n“I’ve submitted a ton of things and have been shot down every time,” an employee says. “Thing is, flood and tornado and fire season is practically here. And now we are expected to just sit and wait for these terrible things to happen before we can so much as pick up the phone and talk to our partners.”\nIn its press release announcing the cancellation of BRIC, a FEMA spokesperson described the program—meant to help vulnerable communities prepare for future storms, floods, and hurricanes—as “another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program.”\n“Ending this program will help ensure that grant funding aligns with the President’s Executive Orders and Secretary Noem’s direction and best support states and local communities in disaster planning, response and recovery,” the press release states.\nBut direct disaster response during a crisis is “only a small slice of what we do and what’s important to talk about,” a FEMA employee says. “Preparedness events, training, webinars, relationship building are essential to emergency management.\"\nSome of the interagency tools FEMA workers rely on for planning are also breaking down. One sea level rise calculator, maintained by the US Army Corps of Engineers, has gone completely offline. Two FEMA employees told WIRED that the administration’s attack on DEI means that many employees have started to steer clear of using any and all tools or datasets that incorporate information on social disparities. This includes the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index. FEMA employees and external partners used the dataset to compare disaster areas with social markers: to identify regions, for instance, with fewer public transportation options, where evacuations might be more difficult, or impoverished areas where low insurance rates mean homeowners might require more financial assistance.\nThe new lack of this data in FEMA operations, employees say, takes away a valuable tool that allows the agency to better prepare for what’s coming.\n“If you can mitigate, you won’t spend as much money constantly responding,” one employee says. “But none of these people are trained in emergency management … [they] just want to gut us so we are only responding to things after they are terrible.”\nUpdated 4-22-25, 11:05 am EST: This story was updated to correct the location of Middletown, New York.",

FEMA staffers who spoke to WIRED were granted anonymity because they aren’t permitted to speak to the press.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The agency hasn’t seen “huge sweeping changes yet, but it doesn’t take much to completely screw a [disaster] response up,” one employee says. “We are being set up for a really, really bad situation.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">FEMA was established in 1979 as an independent agency by an executive order signed by President Jimmy Carter; after 9/11, it was moved under the Department of Homeland Security. In recent years, expensive disasters like Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Helene, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic, have caused the agency’s <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58840#:~:text=For%20federal%20disaster%20spending%20over,was%20$12.5%20billion%2C%20on%20average.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">spending to skyrocket</a>.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">The agency has long been a favorite target of <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/fema-conspiracy-theories-camp-carolina-north-south-rcna176447\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/fema-conspiracy-theories-camp-carolina-north-south-rcna176447\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/fema-conspiracy-theories-camp-carolina-north-south-rcna176447\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">conspiracy theorists</a>. But last year, after Hurricane Helene tore through parts of North Carolina, Donald Trump, encouraged by right-wing influencers, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144159/fema-funding-migrants-disaster-relief-fund\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">amplified misinformation</a> around the agency’s response to the storm, putting a political bullseye on FEMA leading into his second presidency.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">During his first week in office, Trump signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/council-to-assess-the-federal-emergency-management-agency/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">executive order</a> establishing a council to review past disasters managed by FEMA and evaluating its current ability to respond to events, with the order criticizing the agency’s “efficacy, priorities, and competence.” In late March, Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said publicly at a cabinet meeting that DHS would “eliminate FEMA.” A day later, according to reporting from <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/26/noem-fema-restructure-eliminate-grants-00250610\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/26/noem-fema-restructure-eliminate-grants-00250610\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/26/noem-fema-restructure-eliminate-grants-00250610\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Politico</a> and The Washington Post, Noem laid out a plan to cut the agency down to just immediate disaster response <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/26/fema-disaster-recovery/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/26/fema-disaster-recovery/\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/26/fema-disaster-recovery/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">by October</a> and move it under the purview of the White House.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“Unlike the previous administration’s unprepared, disgraceful and inadequate response to natural disasters like Hurricane Helene, the Trump administration is committed to ensuring Americans effected [sic] by emergencies will get the help they need in a quick and efficient manner,” Geoff Harbaugh, FEMA’s associate administrator of the Office of External Affairs, told WIRED in an email. “All operational and readiness requirements will continue to be managed without interruption in close coordination with local and state officials ahead of the 2025 Hurricane Season.

    "content_text": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement is paying software company Palantir $30 million to provide the agency with “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting from the United States, according to a contract justification published in a federal register on Thursday. The tool would also help ICE choose who to deport, giving special priority to “visa overstays,” the document shows.\nPalantir has been an ICE contractor since 2011, but the document published Thursday indicates that Palantir wants to provide brand-new capabilities to ICE. The agency currently does not have any publicly known tools for tracking self-deportation in near real-time. The agency does have a tool for tracking self-reported deportations, but Thursday’s document, which was first reported by Business Insider, does not say to what degree this new tool may rely on self-reported data. ICE also has “insufficient technology” to detect people overstaying their visas, according to the Department of Homeland Security. This is particularly due to challenges in collecting \"biographic and biometric\" data from departing travelers, especially if they leave over land, according to Customs and Border Protection.\nThe agency says in the document that these new capabilities will be under a wholly new platform called the Immigration Lifecycle Operating System, or ImmigrationOS. Palantir is expected to provide a prototype of ImmigrationOS by September 25, 2025, and the contract is scheduled to last at least through September 2027. ICE’s update to the contract comes as the Trump administration is demanding that thousands of immigrants “self-deport,” or leave the US voluntarily.\nICE and Palantir did not respond for comment.\nAccording to the document, ImmigrationOS is intended to have three core functions. Its “Targeting and Enforcement Prioritization” capability would streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens.” People prioritized for removal, ICE says, should be “violent criminals,” gang members, and “visa overstays.”\nIts “Self-Deportation Tracking” function would have “near real-time visibility into instances of self-deporation,” the document says. The document does not say what data Palantir would use for such a system, but ICE says it aims to “accurately report metrics of alien departures from the United States.” The agency stipulates that this tool should also integrate with “enforcement prioritization systems to inform policy” but does not elaborate on these systems or policies.\nMeanwhile, the “Immigration Lifecycle Process” function would streamline the “identification” of aliens and their “removal” from the United States, with the goal of making \"deportation logistics” more efficient.\nIn a “rationale” section, ICE claims that it has an “urgent and compelling” need for ImmigrationOS’s capabilities. Without them, ICE claims, it would be “severely” limited in its ability to target the gangs MS-13 and Tren de Aragua, and abide by President Donald Trump’s executive order to expedite deportations.\nPalantir, ICE claims, is “the only source that can provide the required capabilities and prototype of ImmogrationOS [sic] without causing unacceptable delays.” ICE says the company has developed “deep institutional knowledge of the agency’s operations over more than a decade of support.”\n“No other vendor could meet these timeframes of having the infrastructure in place to meet this urgent requirement and deliver a prototype in less than six months,” ICE says in the document.\nICE’s document does not specify the data sources Palantir would pull from to power ImmigrationOS. However, it says that Palantir could “configure” the case management system that it has provided to ICE since 2014.\nPalantir has done work at various other government agencies as early as 2007. Aside from ICE, it has worked with the US Army, Air Force, Navy, Internal Revenue Service, and Federal Bureau of Investigation. As reported by WIRED, Palantir is currently helping Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) build a brand-new “mega API” at the IRS that could search for records across all the different databases that the agency maintains.\nLast week, 404 Media reported that a recent version of Palantir’s case-management system for ICE allows agents to search for people based on “hundreds of different, highly specific categories,” including how a person entered the country, their current legal status, and their country of origin. It also includes a person’s hair and eye color, whether they have scars or tattoos, and their license-plate reader data, which would provide detailed location data about where that person travels by car.\nThese functionalities have been mentioned in a government privacy assessment published in 2016, and it’s not clear what new information may have been integrated into the case management system over the past four years.\nThis week’s $30 million award is an addition to an existing Palantir contract penned in 2022, originally worth about $17 million, for work on ICE’s case management system. The agency has increased the value of the contract five times prior to this month; the largest was a $19 million increase in September 2023.\nThe contract’s ImmigrationOS update was first documented on April 11 in a government-run database tracking federal spending. The entry had a 248-character description of the change. The five-page document ICE published Thursday, meanwhile, has a more detailed description of Palantir’s expected services for the agency.\nThe contract update comes as the Trump administration deputizes ICE and other government agencies to drastically escalate the tactics and scale of deportations from the US. In recent weeks, immigration authorities have arrested and detained people with student visas and green cards, and deported at least 238 people to a brutal megaprison in El Salvador, some of whom have not been able to speak with a lawyer or have due process.\nAs part of its efforts to push people to self-deport, DHS in late March revoked the temporary parole of more than half a million people and demanded that they self-deport in about a month, despite having been granted authorization to live in the US after fleeing dangerous or unstable situations in Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela under the so-called “CHNV parole programs.”\nLast week, the Social Security Administration listed more than 6,000 of these people as dead, a tactic meant to end their financial lives. DHS, meanwhile, sent emails to an unknown number of people declaring that their parole had been revoked and demanding that they self-deport. Several US citizens, including immigration attorneys, received the email.\nOn Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s move to revoke people’s authorization to live in the US under the CHNV programs. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt called the judge’s ruling “rogue.”",

    "content_text": "Nintendo Switch 2 preorders are back on, and while consoles will remain the same price, accessories will be more expensive due to President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements.\nThe company said today that preorders will begin next week, April 24, and that the Switch 2 will remain $450 at launch, despite sweeping tariffs announced earlier this month by President Trump that threatened to raise prices. The Mario Kart World Bundle, which includes the console and game, will still sell for $499.99; the game itself, as well as Donkey Kong Bananza, will also keep their original price tags of $79.99 and $69.99, respectively.\n“We apologize for the retail preorder delay and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our consumers may be experiencing,” Nintendo said in an official statement.\nOn April 4, just two days after a Switch 2 reveal event held in New York City, Nintendo announced the unprecedented move of delaying preorders “in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.” Nintendo President of America Doug Bowser previously told WIRED that the company was “actively assessing” the impact Trump’s tariffs would have on the Switch 2’s production and launch.\nHowever, Switch 2 accessories will “experience price adjustments from those announced on April 2 due to changes in market conditions,” Nintendo said in a statement. The Pro controller, for example, originally announced at $79.99, is now $84.99; the Joy-Con 2 is now $94.99, as opposed to $89.99. Other increases include the Dock Set, which was announced at $109.99 and will now sell for $119.99.\nThe company also notes that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.”\nTrump announced “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2, including baseline tariffs of 10 percent for all countries. He has also raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 percent, but after China announced 125 percent tariffs on the US in response, the White House said China could face up to 245 percent in tariffs on some goods. The Trump administration has also said electronics will be exempted from both the baseline tariffs and those levied at China.\nTrump has threatened additional tariffs on other countries, though on April 10 he said those would be paused for 90 days while the US negotiates.\nThe uncertainty has sent many industries scrambling as markets have crashed. Between rising prices for consumers and possibly extending the financial conditions that have led to years of cuts and mass layoffs, tariffs will negatively affect the entire industry, from the people who make games to those who play them.\nOther Consoles\nThe US and China are the largest games markets in the world, and tariffs would affect both countries differently. US tariffs could mean an increase in price for American players, whether it’s consoles or games themselves, for more than just Nintendo products. Sony and Microsoft may not have a new console lined up, but their hardware will be affected as well.\nAhmad says that both companies are still “heavily reliant” on China and that high tariffs will also raise the prices for PlayStation and Xbox consoles. He pointed to Sony’s recent announcement that it will increase prices by 25 percent for the PlayStation 5 in Australia, Europe, and New Zealand.\n“There are indirect and knock-on effects for exchange rates, inflation and broader macro impacts,” Ahmad says, regardless of whether or not other countries are directly affected by imports from China and Vietnam. Sony’s price increases, he says, are likely a “response to a future US price increase (Sony's largest market), with the firm looking to spread cost increases globally and maintain margins.”\nAccording to game industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls, even a 10 percent tariff would likely make purchasing consoles and games less attractive to players, if they’re feeling pinched financially.\nPhysical Games\nAlthough digital games won’t be impacted by tariffs, physical games would be, but how much prices increase will depend on where the games were made. Ahmad points to Nintendo manufacturing its games in Japan, while Xbox does some of that work in Mexico. “While there are currently tariff exemptions on physical games for these countries, any future tariffs would have an impact on physical game prices,” he tells WIRED. “This may have a knock-on effect for digital game prices too, despite not being directly impacted.“\nIf retail prices soar, players are more likely to embrace digital-first media and ditch any remaining reliance on physical games. “That’s a benefit to the console platforms as their storefronts are the key sales channel for games on their platforms,” says Harding Rolls.\nMore Layoffs Likely\nFor the past few years, the game industry has undergone an unprecedented loss of jobs and talent—and while the industry has started to rebound, tariffs could reverse that progress, according to Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insights at Niko Partners.\n“Corporate sentiment and investment behavior basically switched from ‘on/happy’ to ‘off/unhappy’ on one day,” he says.\nUnable to find funding or hit high success benchmarks, companies like Microsoft and Sony have shut down studios such as Arkane Austin and Firewalk, respectively, or laid off employees. Smaller developers, like Eggnut and Paladin, shut down completely, while others, such as League of Geeks, have gone on “hiatus.” But the industry started seeing more investment in 2025, Ahmad says. “If these markets are thrown into turmoil by tariffs or the threat of tariffs, there will be far less investment in growing the games and gaming hardware sectors there and in the US.”\nHarding-Rolls echoes this, telling WIRED that “a major shock like this will negatively impact the industry and exacerbate existing conditions, which are already challenging from a funding and staff layoffs point of view. “\nTrade War Could Spark Boycotts\nOn top of making gaming pricier, and therefore more of a luxury hobby not everyone can afford, the tariffs may also lead to consumer backlash in other territories. Ahmad points to Chinese consumers, who for three years boycotted products from South Korea in solidarity with their government. (Chinese regulators suspended licensing for Korean games, preventing them from being published in China; although a reason was not given, analysts at the time pointed to rising tensions between the two counties.)\n“Consumers in some of the Asian markets that are most impacted by the tariffs can sometimes behave quite nationalistically and loyally to their own leadership,” he says. “No matter where the tariff level ends up, consumers can offer their own backlash against products and services from the United States in a form of protest.”",

The <em>Mario Kart World</em> Bundle, which includes the console and game, will still sell for $499.99; the game itself, as well as <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, will also keep their original price tags of $79.99 and $69.99, respectively.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“We apologize for the retail preorder delay and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our consumers may be experiencing,” Nintendo said in an official statement.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">On April 4, just two days after a Switch 2 reveal event held in New York City, Nintendo announced the unprecedented move of delaying preorders “in order to assess the potential <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/trump-tariffs-penguins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">impact of tariffs</a> and evolving market conditions.” Nintendo President of America Doug Bowser previously <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/nintendo-is-actively-assessing-what-trade-war-means-for-switch-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told WIRED</a> that the company was “actively assessing” the impact Trump’s tariffs would have on the Switch 2’s production and launch.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">However, Switch 2 accessories will “experience price adjustments from those announced on April 2 due to changes in market conditions,” Nintendo said in a statement. The Pro controller, for example, originally announced at $79.99, is now $84.99; the Joy-Con 2 is now $94.99, as opposed to $89.99. Other increases include the Dock Set, which was announced at $109.99 and will now sell for $119.99.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The company also notes that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.”</p><p class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe iDXPAN callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Trump announced “Liberation Day” <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/uncanny-valley-podcast-trump-tariffs-market-madness/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tariffs</a> on April 2, including baseline tariffs of 10 percent for all countries.

    "content_text": "This week, Mark Zuckerberg took the stand in an antitrust trial that could result in the breakup of Meta’s social networking empire. It might be years before the nearly 3 billion users of the company’s flagship app Facebook—known internally as the Blue app—learn the fate of the service they still use, despite the constant obituaries. (For the record, two years ago, Tom Alison, who heads the service, issued a statement affirming “Facebook is not dead nor dying.”) But with all the hubbub surrounding the trial, Facebook users might have missed the most significant news about Blue in years. On March 27, 2025, the 21-year-old company quietly announced a new feature on its mobile app: an option that would give users the novel experience of seeing their friends’ content on Facebook. Finally, there was an alternative to a news feed overwhelmed with garbage, gossip, and influencer videos that people don’t necessarily ask for but can’t resist clicking on and then feeling bad about. By locating and selecting the Friends tab, your feed will populate exclusively with posts from people you know in real life and that you have chosen to connect with. You might even call it a social app. Imagine!\nThe company’s explanation is telling. “Over the years, Facebook evolved to meet changing needs...” read the press release, “but the magic of friends has fallen away.” I marvel at the passive voice. Meta's valuation is over a trillion. It has connected nearly half of humanity—all because of the power of people wanting to keep up with friends and family. And somehow, the company’s core purpose of connecting friends just … fell away? Did the thousands of engineers, designers, marketers, and managers working on Facebook just wake one day and say, “Hey, has anyone seen the stuff that’s the very reason we are a company?”\nNo, this didn’t just happen. Consider that, in that 2023 press release about Facebook not being dead, Alison listed the priorities for the app that year, including “artificial intelligence, messaging, creators and monetization.” Not a word about boosting friend content, even though Meta executives knew that people wanted to see just that. It came out in court that for years Zuckerberg has been aware that his users crave hearing more from their friends. A Meta survey in 2020 found that 61 percent of users wanted more friend posts, and 66 percent wanted to see a wider diversity of posts among their friends. A year later, another survey reported that three out of the top four “pain points” on Facebook were due to what the Federal Trade Commission called “reduced investment in friends and family sharing.”\nHere’s one explanation for this. Content from influencers, political activists, and faux news organizations is more profitable and keeps people on the service longer. Misinformation from a stranger is worth more to Meta than family updates and travel photos from friends. Those don’t usually go viral. That’s why, when Alison wrote about AI, he didn’t mean using it to find what your friends are saying but to connect you with creators who are posting to boost their own wallets, with the help of Facebook monetization. On the stand, Zuckerberg offered a different explanation for the change: People began sharing on messaging apps instead of social platforms. But could it be that the reason that they stopped sharing on Facebook was that all those toxic posts from strangers made the platform unpleasant?\nZuckerberg was slippery when it came to admitting that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate competition—a key issue in the trial. But he was frank in acknowledging that the mission of the company has veered dramatically from the original feel-good crusade to connect humans. It’s now as much an entertainment company as a social network, he says. A chart shared by Meta showed that entertainment had overwhelmed social content. In 2025, Facebook users spent only 17 percent of their time looking at content shared from friends. That’s not because they prefer to read stuff from influencers and anger-boosters—remember, Meta’s own surveys show that users are dying to see stuff from people they know. Yet Zuckerberg matter-of-factly noted that when it comes to friend content, “That part of what we do hasn’t really grown.” Again, the passive voice!\nGiven the hunger people have to see friend posts, one might expect that the skills of Meta’s talented workforce would be employed to maximize the value of human connections. For many years, it was. In the early 2010s, I was frequently called to Mark Zuckerberg’s conference room, dubbed the Aquarium, to see some interesting project meant to increase the value of the social network. Some of those projects didn’t work out—remember graph search?—but they were honest attempts at fulfilling the company mission. As the decade progressed, the social aspect of Facebook became less of a priority for Zuckerberg, and his passion shifted to virtual reality and artificial intelligence.\nHere’s the link to the antitrust case: Meta was able to shift to entertainment because it had locked in billions of customers who originally joined the platform to be in touch with their friends. Without worrying about competition, Meta could then turn the focus toward content from strangers. When Meta copies a feature like Reels from a rival like TikTok, its built-in audience will consume it, even if the originals do it better. The company was able to get 300 million users on Threads not because its Twitter clone was particularly great but because it could easily shift its Instagram audience to the new service. Its biggest innovations on its social apps in recent years aren’t directed at improving the experience for users but at delivering content from strangers that compels you to click or becoming more efficient in serving personalized ads. Meta’s gold standard is not a post about your cousin having a baby but some viral dispatch from an influencer or pundit, whether or not it makes you feel bad about yourself or appeals to some prurient instinct.\nIn another world I might be able to move my social network to another app that focuses more on preserving “the magic of friends.” But not in this world.\nI’m not a lawyer, so I don’t know what the outcome of this trial will be. But I did write a book about Facebook and spent considerable time on how and why the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp. It was clear from my reporting—and internal emails now confirm—that in 2012, Zuckerberg thought Instagram was a competitive threat, and he forced the issue by offering to buy it for $1 billion when the company was worth only half that. I can sympathize with Meta’s argument that it may be unfair to roll back a merger that the government originally approved—but I found out that at the time, one of the five FTC commissioners wanted to pause the deal and take its investigation to the next stage. He was unable to convince the others, and the deal went through.\nThe WhatsApp founders just plain didn’t want to sell their company. But Zuckerberg’s spyware operation determined that WhatApp’s growth was a threat, and his offers kept getting larger until they reached the absurd amount of $19 billion for a tiny company with miniscule revenue. “Mark Zuckerberg checkmated us,” cofounder Brian Acton told me. “When a guy shows up with a suitcase of money, you have to say yes; you have to make the rational choice.” (Acton came to regret the move. “That is my crime,” he told me.) When a company dared not sell to Zuckerberg he would make good on threats to openly copy its product. While wooing Snap’s Evan Spiegel, Zuckerberg mentioned he was thinking of doing a similar project named Poke. Snap refused the offer and Zuckerberg soon emailed Spiegel a message: “I hope you enjoy Poke.” (Facebook’s clone flopped.)\nI’ll leave the remedy for all this to Judge James Boasberg—or Donald Trump, who may pull the plug on the whole operation if he feels like it. (It’s good to be king.) In the interim, I’ve been using the Friends tab, and my feed is much better. The only problem is that so few of my 2,000 friends post on Facebook. They’re seeking magic elsewhere.",

The puffer jacket may have eclipsed it in popularity, and merino wool is sustainable and stink-free. But the humble fleece is durable, breathable, and light. It also costs next to nothing. (I have 30-year-old Marmot fleece that still works great.)\nMuch as I still love that old fleece, you may have noticed climbers and backpackers wearing a specific kind of new, high-tech performance fleece—whether it's the Patagonia R1, the Senchi Designs Alpha 120, or the famous, ever-elusive Melanzana Micro Grid. What is it? Do you need it? Here's a quick rundown of fleece varieties.

Subscribe Today.\nThe Original Fleece\nLong, long ago (since the 1980s, to be precise), there was just fleece. The lightweight fabric was invented by Malden Mills (now known as Polartec). And it was good, most of the time. The humble fleece jacket I've been carrying for all these years is great for breaks on high passes, when the temperature drops suddenly and the wind picks up. While fleece's wind resistance isn't as good as a shell, it can hold the wind at bay during hiking breaks. Fleece is also great around camp, and even off the trail, in town.\nDepending on the temperature and ventilation options, it can also be a good option for aerobic activities. For example, a half-zip fleece pullover offers a little more ventilation. I often start out spring and fall days hiking in fleece through the cool mornings, and it works great. But when you're very active—cycling for example—you can overwhelm traditional fleece's breathability. Textile manufacturers began working on new types of fleece to address the lack of breathability.\nGrid Fleece\nThe fact that OG fleece does eventually get overwhelmed when you're really moving led Polartec, creators of fleece, to develop a grid fleece known as Polartec Power Grid. Grid fleece weaves in about 5 percent elastane (aka Spandex) in a grid-like pattern (hence the name).\nThe gaps in the grid allow more moisture out, which increases the breathability significantly. The gridded blocks trap air, keeping you warm. The trade-off is that grid fleece is much less effective in the wind.\nGrid fleece is generally not intended to be something you put on at camp, but something you hike in during the day. Really, grid fleece isn’t a great stand-alone garment. Where grid fleece excels is when paired with a windshirt or rain jacket. This combo is especially great for high aerobic-intensity activities like cycling. Pairing grid fleece with my Patagonia Houdini wind shell is perfect for early rides on cold mornings. Grid fleece with a wind shell is better at blocking the wind than traditional fleece and more breathable as well.\nAlpha Direct Fleece\nIn 2017, in conjunction with the US military, Polartec created Alpha Direct fleece (sometimes called just Alpha), which is even lighter and more breathable than grid fleece. Alpha fleece uses a fishnet-like weave to hold high-loft fibers in between the weave. For military purposes, this layer was then put under a windproof outer layer, which makes it considerably heavier. But some cottage industry hiking companies got hold of the fabric and started making fleece hoodies using just Alpha Direct.\nThe result is a garment that has a startlingly good warmth-to-weight ratio, so long as the wind isn't blowing. As with grid fleece, you want to pair an Alpha Direct fleece hoodie with a windproof shell. Alpha Direct weighs next to nothing, and an entire hoodie can stuff down to not much bigger than your fist. Yet they are nearly as warm as a traditional fleece (until the wind blows). They've proved popular with thru hikers and other ultralight backpackers.\nThe downside to Alpha Direct is that the weave is very fragile. Any kind of rough bushwhacking will quickly shred your Alpha Direct fleece to nothingness. A friend who tried one in the canyon country of Utah likened it to being a big horn sheep—you leave a tuft of your jacket on every passing branch. However, if you stick to areas where abrasion isn't an issue, or you only wear it in camp, or you pair it with a shell, Alpha Direct fleece wins hands down on warmth-to-weight and for packing down to a tiny size.\nFor a while, Rab made a jacket called the Alpha Freak (no longer sold) that was an intriguing combination of grid fleece and Polartec Alpha Direct 190 gsm, or grams per square meter, fleece. It even had some Pertex Quantum over the hood to keep your head warmer. By all accounts, this was something of a technical marvel that a lucky few backpackers now carefully horde. Rab, if you're listening, bring back the Alpha Freak.\nWhich Kind of Fleece Should You Get?\nThe answer depends on what you're doing.\nTraditional fleece jacket: This remains the most durable and versatile of the bunch. It breathes, it's the most windproof, it's pretty light, and it's cheap. Solid fleece also dries very quickly (you can wring it out) and is warmer than your average sweatshirt. Go for a full-length zipper, and size up if you want to increase breathability. This is the best all-around option. When you can get one for less than $25 dollars, there's really no reason not to have one.\nGrid fleece: If you're planning on being active in cold weather, hiking, biking, running, or walking, grid fleece is a better option. You'll want to pair it with a shell if there's any wind, but the increased breathability makes grid fleece the best choice for getting after it.\nAlpha Direct fleece: The lightest of the bunch, Alpha Direct is great when you’re headed into the backcountry and want an ultralight fleece as your insulating layer. Alpha Direct comes in a variety of fabric weights, from a partly see-through 60 gsm to a more useful (and durable) 120 gsm, all the way up to 190 gsm. I have not tested anything at 190 gsm. The most popular seems to be the 60 and 90 gsm, but I have found 120 gsm feels like the sweet spot between weight (about 8 ounces for a men’s large) and warmth. As an added bonus, 120 gsm is about where you stop looking like a bizarre thru-hiking creature and have a jacket you can walk around town in without attracting stares. (Maybe. Depending on the town.) Just beware hiking in rough terrain. Snagging Alpha Fleece on anything will quickly destroy it.\nIn the end, depending on what you do outdoors, you might want one of each. Thankfully several of these are quite cheap. For traditional fleece I like a quarter-zip pull over, which can be had at Decathalon for $25, or if you want something a bit more stylish you can go for the Patagonia Micro D pullover for $70.\nGrid fleece is the priciest of the bunch—Patagonia's popular Men's R1 Air is $180—though there are much cheaper options available. I haven't tested it yet, but several thru-hikers I know speak highly of Squak Mountain's grid fleece hoodie ($65). Alpha Direct fleece is getting more popular outside the hiking/backpacking community, which has led to numerous new options we're in the process of testing, but two tried-and-true standbys remain my top picks.\nBoth the Senchi Designs Alpha Direct 90 hoodie, and the Leve Alpha 90 hoodie are also great, though availability is limited. That also contributes to Alpha Direct's allure—many of the small companies that make these layers only make them in small drops.\nThe downside to fleece is that fleece is a huge contributor to plastic pollution, specifically microplastics, which fleece sheds when you wash it. Alpha Direct fleece is much worse about this than the others (did I mention that it's fragile?). The loose weave of Alpha Direct sheds pretty bad, both in the wash and on the trail. Many companies making Alpha Direct garments will include a microplastic wash bag, which helps somewhat, but it's still not ideal.\nThis is where wool wins. It's better for the environment and its made of natural, renewable materials. If weight or expense is not your primary concern, I suggest merino wool.",

class=\"paywall\">The fact that OG fleece does eventually get overwhelmed when you're really moving led Polartec, creators of fleece, to develop a grid fleece known as Polartec Power Grid. Grid fleece weaves in about 5 percent elastane (aka Spandex) in a grid-like pattern (hence the name).</p><p class=\"paywall\">The gaps in the grid allow more moisture out, which increases the breathability significantly. The gridded blocks trap air, keeping you warm. The trade-off is that grid fleece is much less effective in the wind.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Grid fleece is generally not intended to be something you put on at camp, but something you hike in during the day. Really, grid fleece isn’t a great stand-alone garment. Where grid fleece excels is when paired with a windshirt or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-rain-jackets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rain jacket</a>. This combo is especially great for high aerobic-intensity activities like cycling.

Alpha fleece uses a fishnet-like weave to hold high-loft fibers in between the weave. For military purposes, this layer was then put under a windproof outer layer, which makes it considerably heavier. But some cottage industry hiking companies got hold of the fabric and started making fleece hoodies using just Alpha Direct.</p></div></div></body></html>",

Colsky, founder at National Sleep Center\nLeah Kaylor, psychologist\nPick a Spot\nFirst off, you’ll need to figure out where you’re going to sleep. There are websites and resources all over the place—you can check out the website Sleeping in Airports, which Sarah Mattina, a former corporate employee for Southwest and JetBlue, said is the “holy grail” for finding the darkest, quietest spot to sleep in the airport. (Other experts also recommended this site.) It has dedicated guides for “pretty much every major airport in the world.” (I checked out the guide for O’Hare in Chicago and can confirm that the best sleeping spots it lists are indeed the actual best sleeping spots from my experience spending many hours passed out waiting for a delayed flight to arrive.)\nYou could also try the subreddit for the city or airport you’re going to be in. If your gate is busy, you can scope out other gates in the same terminal. Find a chill spot in the corner—you might even be able to find a chair or bench without armrests. Psychologist Leah Kaylor recommends choosing a secure, low-traffic area and says corners near airport chapels or family lounges may be a quieter spots than others. Ideally, you want to pick a place that has some staff around, such as security patrols or kiosks, but not a place so busy with people that you can’t fall asleep.\nMany of the experts I consulted recommended checking out airport lounges if you’re able to, since the seating is comfier and the area is generally quieter. They pointed out that some credit cards give you access to various airport lounges, or consider purchasing a day pass for longer layovers. You might even be able to snag a shower in an airport lounge (or a drink to help you get sleepy, though Andrew E. Colsky, founder of the National Sleep Center, recommends avoiding alcohol since it suppresses REM sleep and acts as a diuretic). Some airports have dedicated nap pods or nap rooms, for a fee, but they offer you a spot to sleep with your bags corralled and no fear of strangers staring you down from the other end of the terminal.\nMake Sure You’ve Got the Right Gear\nMost airports aren’t conducive to sleep. They’re loud, they’re full of fluorescent lights, and they can be a bit chilly.\nSo you’ll want a good travel pillow. I think the Trtl pillow ($65) is best for sleeping in awkward places. It has a frame that offers built-in neck support, so you almost feel like you’re sleeping with an actual pillow on an actual bed. The microfiber fleece also helps keep your neck warm, although you may want a travel shawl, scarf, or blanket to help add an additional layer.\nA sleep mask that blocks light is also a solid bet. Trtl also makes the fantastic Glimpse Sleep Mask ($85), which allows you to lift the outer flap to peek at your surroundings. This might help you feel a bit less dead to the world. Otherwise, a lightweight mask like this affordable, travel-friendly silk option from Blissy ($28) will block out most light without making you feel completely unplugged.\nIf sound bothers you while you sleep, a good pair of earplugs can help. You could check out our favorites for sleep, the Loop Quiet 2 ($20), or just get a foam pair that will muffle outside noise. Or if you need some white noise, a pair of sleep earbuds can help you get into the right headspace for some shut-eye.\nAs Jade Wu points out, an eye mask and earplugs “can go a long way, not only for blocking out noise and light but for signaling to others around you that you’re trying to sleep.” She advises wearing breathable layers for better temperature regulation, and to keep in mind that extra clothes can serve as a neck pillow.\nBefore You Hunker Down\nMake sure to set an alarm. Multiple alarms! And make sure those alarms have sound and haptic feedback turned on. As Schwab mentions, the last thing you want is to wake up to your flight taxiing from the gate. Kaylor advises a vibrating alarm under your pillow or on your smartwatch to ensure that you don’t accidentally sleep through it. If you’re traveling with kids who are too wired to sleep, consider taking sleep shifts with the adults in your party so you can all get some shut-eye.\nYou’ll want to be considerate of your fellow travelers. Don’t take up an entire row of seats at the busiest gate or sprawl out on the floor in the middle of a walkway. And in the same vein, you want to be aware of your surroundings. When I nap in airports, I always loop my bag’s straps fully around my body, or place my feet on top of my luggage. That way you’ll be complying with the airport rules of not leaving your bag unattended, and it’ll discourage people from rifling through your stuff while you’re dozing. On that same note, make sure your luggage is locked up if you’ve got the means. You could consider adding a Bluetooth tracker to your luggage for additional peace of mind.\nAnd finally, don’t be afraid to do what you need to in order to get comfortable (former tips notwithstanding). If you need to stretch out on the floor with your luggage under your knees for proper circulation, do it. If you’re seated at a gate where the next flight doesn’t leave for six hours, don’t be afraid to post up and get comfy. If the airport lounge isn’t too crowded, you can rearrange the recliners to form a makeshift bed. Do what you need to do so long as it’s not at the expense of your fellow travelers. Consider using some deep breathing or muscle relaxation techniques to help your mind slip into sleep mode, and be prepared to wake up fresh as a daisy, ready to board a flight to your next adventure.",

    "content_text": "The Best Curling Irons of 2025, Tested and Reviewed\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nCurling irons and I have a complicated history. It’s a scarring relationship, built on burns, breakage, and the faint smell of singed hair. If you grew up in the early 2000s, you remember the cheap, clampy contraptions that left you with burnt fingertips, regrettable hairstyles, and—if you weren’t careful—a neck hickey that wasn’t from your high school boyfriend. But despite the occasional battle scars, curling irons have been a rite of girlhood. Bouncy ringlets for middle school plays, romantic waves for senior prom, a tousled blowout for graduation.\nThe pursuit of the perfect curl is as old as civilization itself. The Romans wielded heated iron rods (calamistrum) to sculpt Venus-like spirals. Medieval wig wearers would bake their curls at the bakery, where they would wrap them inside a protective pastry cut and toss them into the oven. The Victorians, ever committed to aesthetic suffering, warmed their curling tongs over open flames for polished waves. A scorched strand here, a seared forehead there—beauty, they say, is pain.\nFortunately, today’s curlers—like our top pick, T3 Singlepass Curl X ($150)—are smarter and pain-free (for the most part).

Ceramic is the most universal choice—ideal for fine, curly, or coily hair because it distributes heat evenly and helps lock in moisture. Ceramic irons also emit negative ions, which is science-speak for smoothing frizz and preventing crispy ends. Tourmaline takes it up a notch, firing off six times more negative ions for extra shine, making it a great option for thick or frizz-prone hair. If you have straight hair that struggles to hold a style, titanium might be your best bet. It heats up fast, holds high temperatures, and sets curls that last (at least until past lunch).\nTo clamp or not to clamp? Traditional curling irons with a clamp create more structured, long-lasting curls. Curling wands are clipless and better for natural-looking waves with no creases. Tapered wands are wider at the base and narrower at the tip, creating tousled curls that are looser at the roots and tighter at the ends. Wavers, designed with two or three barrels, deliver beachy S-shaped bends.\nSize matters. The barrel size dictates the curl pattern.\n- ¾-inch: Corkscrew curls and ringlets. Best for short hair.\n- 1-inch: Classic curls. Suitable for all hair lengths. If in doubt, start here.\n- 1¼-inch: Soft, tousled waves or for adding texture to updos. Best for medium to long hair.\n- 1½-inch and up: Loose, voluminous waves. Suitable for long hair.\nWhat's your heat range? Not all hair types can handle the same level of heat. Fine or chemically treated hair should stay under 300 degrees Fahrenheit. For healthy and medium-textured hair, 300 to 380 degrees is the sweet spot. If you have coarse, curly, or thick hair, you’ll need 300 to 450 degrees. P.S. Don’t forget the heat protectant spray.\nAny add-ons? Some curling irons have a cool-touch tip for safer handling. Some come with interchangeable barrels, which means you don’t have to pick just one curl type—Marilyn ringlets today, mermaid waves tomorrow. Cord length also matters. A professional-level curling iron has a 9-foot cord because anything shorter is difficult to maneuver when styling. (Bonus points for a swivel mechanism, so it doesn’t twist and tangle.)\nHow We Tested\nTo find the best curlers for every hair type, budget, and skill level, I first scoured the market for the latest and greatest tools, everything from traditional clamps to auto-curlers that do the work for you. Each hair tool was tested for at least two weeks. Here’s how I evaluated each tool:\n- Ease of use. I assessed weight, grip comfort, clamp tension, and whether the cord behaved or ended up in a knotted mess.\n- Heat settings. In addition to temperature ranges. I also monitored how fast each heated up, whether it maintained a consistent temp during styling, and if it fried my ends.\n- Hairstyle longevity. I enlisted WIRED reviewers with straight, wavy, and curly hair to put these curlers to the real-world test. Did the curls last or deflate before noon?\n- Price and value. I compared cost to performance and will continue to test for long-term durability.\n- Features. Digital temperature control, automatic shutoff, dual voltage for travel … if it was advertised by the company, I made sure it delivered.\nHonorable Mentions\nBondiBoost Clever Curler 1 ¼” Curling Iron with Ion Technology for $58: Thanks to its nonslip matte material and included heat glove, I found this hair tool the easiest to grip and handle out of the bunch. It warmed rather quickly, and I held my hair onto the barrel for only around 45 seconds before it reached a nice, thick curl. I also found it to be very ergonomic generally— the iron is not too long or too short and was easy to navigate at different angles around my head when I was curling each section of hair. The only thing I didn’t love about this iron was that the base of the clamp left my hair with more of a crimp than a curl toward the top of my head. I had to go over these areas two to three more times to smooth out the crimps, which added more time to my routine. This iron is 10/10 for handling and ease of use but could use a more lightweight clamp so it doesn’t impress on the hair so intensely. If you have thick hair, this may just be the iron for you.\nConair Double Ceramic 1-Inch Curling Iron for $20: I’d recommend this one if you’re not looking to invest a ton in a curling iron or have short hair that curls easily and quickly. It’s rather bulky compared to its competitors, and I felt that it delivered more of a wave than a curl on my hair. I found the outcome to be less than impressive, but I did like that the heat was consistent and easy to control by turning the knob at the base of the iron. I also like that it has a little lip on the underside of the iron to make sure it doesn’t slip or slide around when you put it down.\nQ&A, Curling Iron Edition\nIs Titanium or Ceramic Better for Curling Hair?\nIt depends on your hair type and texture. Titanium curling irons heat up fast, stay hot, and power through thick and coarse hair. These curls tend to last longer, but titanium can be too intense for fine or damaged hair. Ceramic irons are gentler. They distribute heat more evenly, reduce hot spots, and rely on infrared heat to style hair from the inside out. This makes it ideal for fine, fragile, or color-treated hair.\nWhat’s the Difference Between a Curling Iron and a Curling Wand?\nCurling irons come with a clamp that holds your hair in place for uniform curls. Clamps can leave creases if you're not careful. Curling wands are clamp-free, leaving you to wrap your hair around the barrel manually. Wands tend to be faster, but they also require more technique and a steadier hand. Also, if your wand doesn't have a cool-touch tip, it's easier to burn your fingers. Most curling irons have a straight cylindrical shape, while wands can taper for more variation. If you want structured curls, go for an iron. If you prefer natural-looking waves, a wand is your best friend.\nHow Do You Make Curls Last?\nFirst, a heat-protectant spray is a non-negotiable. Now, if you're using a hot curling oil, your hair needs to be dry because damp strands are more susceptible to heat damage. Heatless curls and airstylers need hair to be slightly damp—think 90 percent dry. Curling your hair the day after washing is best. That's when the hair cuticle is open, and natural oils have had time to settle in, giving the curl some texture to grip onto. If you have freshly washed hair and must curl your hair, a texturizing spray can add some grit.\nPin your curls up while they cool. It helps set them, making them last longer. Finish with a quality hairspray.",

    "content_text": "LG TVs will soon leverage an artificial intelligence model built for showing advertisements that more closely align with viewers' personal beliefs and emotions.\nThe company plans to incorporate a partner company’s AI tech into its TV software in order to interpret psychological factors impacting a viewer, such as personal interests, personality traits, and lifestyle choices. The aim is to show LG webOS users ads that will emotionally impact them.\nThe upcoming advertising approach comes via a multiyear licensing deal with Zenapse, a company that describes itself as a software-as-a-service marketing platform that can drive advertiser sales “with AI-powered emotional intelligence.” LG will use Zenapse’s technology to divide webOS users into hyper-specific market segments that are supposed to be more informative to advertisers. LG Ad Solutions, LG’s advertising business, announced the partnership on Tuesday.\nThe technology will be used to inform ads shown on LG smart TVs’ home screens, free ad-supported TV (FAST) channels, and elsewhere throughout webOS, per StreamTV Insider. LG will also use Zenapse's tech to “expand new software development and go-to-market products,\" it said. LG didn’t specify the duration of its licensing deal with Zenapse.\nZenapse’s platform for connected TVs (CTVs), ZenVision, is supposed to be able to interpret the types of emotions shown in the content someone is watching on TV, partially by using publicly available information about the show's or movie’s script and plot, StreamTV Insider reported. ZenVision also analyzes viewer behavior, grouping viewers based on their consumption patterns, the publication noted. Under the new partnership, ZenVision can use data that LG has gathered from the automatic content recognition software in LG TVs.\nWith all this information, ZenVision will group LG TV viewers into highly specified market segments, such as “goal-driven achievers,” “social connectors,” or \"emotionally engaged planners,\" an LG spokesperson told StreamTV Insider. Zenapse's website for ZenVision points to other potential market segments, including \"digital adopters,\" \"wellness seekers,\" \"positive impact & environment,\" and \"money matters.\"\nCompanies paying to advertise on LG TVs can then target viewers based on the ZenVision-specified market segments and deliver an “emotionally intelligent ad,” as Zenapse’s website puts it.\nThis type of targeted advertising aims to bring advertisers more in-depth information about TV viewers than demographic data or even contextual advertising (which shows ads based on what the viewer is watching) via psychographic data. Demographic data gives advertisers viewer information, like location, age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and income. Psychographic data is supposed to go deeper and allow advertisers to target people based on so-called psychological factors, like personal beliefs, values, and attitudes. As Salesforce explains, “psychographic segmentation delves deeper into their psyche” than relying on demographic data.\n“As viewers engage with content, ZenVision's understanding of a consumer grows deeper, and our... segmentation continually evolves to optimize predictions,” the ZenVision website says.\nGetting Emotional\nLG’s partnership with Zenapse comes as advertisers struggle to appeal to TV viewers’ emotions. Google, for example, attempted to tug at parents’ heartstrings with the now-infamous Dear Sydney ad aired during the 2024 Summer Olympics. Looking to push Gemini, Google hit all the wrong chords with parents, and, after much backlash, pulled the ad.\nThe partnership also comes as TV OS operators seek new ways to use smart TVs to grow their own advertising businesses and to get people to use TVs to buy stuff.\nWith their ability to track TV viewers' behavior, including what they watch and search for on their TVs, smart TVs are a growing obsession for advertisers. As LG's announcement pointed out, CTVs represent \"one of the fastest-growing ad segments in the US, expected to reach over $40 billion by 2027, up from $24.6 billion in 2023.\"\nHowever, as advertisers' interest in appealing to streamers grows, so do their efforts to track and understand viewers for more targeted advertising. Both efforts could end up pushing the limits of user comfort and privacy.\nLG is one of the biggest global TV brands, so its plan to distribute emotionally driven ads to the 200 million LG TVs currently in people's homes could have a ripple effect. Further illustrating the dominance of LG TVs, webOS is estimated to be in 35 percent of US homes, per data that Hub Entertainment Research shared this week. As such, LG's foray into advertising driven by AI’s ability to understand and appeal to viewer emotions could lead to other CTV OSes following suit.\nFor its part, LG thinks it can use Zenapse's tech to make \"future innovations that could shape new emotionally intelligent experiences for the TV screen,\" a spokesperson told StreamTV Insider.\nAs it stands, targeted ads are a divisive approach to what we might consider a necessary evil: advertising. While targeted ads rely on tracking techniques that many find invasive, they could also result in ads that are more relevant and less annoying to the people seeing them. In cases where advertising is inevitable, some prefer ads that appeal on a personal level over messaging that can be inappropriate or, even, disturbing and offensive.\nAt this stage, we don’t know how the ads shown on LG’s webOS might evolve with Zenapse’s technology. But it seems like LG and, likely, other smart TV OS operators will try to strengthen their abilities to understand your convictions, beliefs, and values.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "Operatives from Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at the Department of Labor (DOL) have access to systems that house sensitive data pertaining to immigrants, sources tell WIRED. This access comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has continued its crackdown on immigrants around the US, and DOGE has played a key role in collecting personal data on them.\nWIRED previously reported that Miles Collins, Aram Moghaddassi, and Marko Elez are all DOGE operatives embedded at the Labor Department.\nCollins has access to the DOL’s National Farmworker Jobs Program (NFJP) system, according to sources with direct knowledge. This program offers funding to organizations that work with migrant and seasonal farmworkers, as well as organizations working on the state level to support job training for low-income farm workers. Last year, the program disbursed $90 million in grants. Anyone legally allowed to work in the United States and who meets the program’s criteria is eligible for support.\n“When I say ‘migrant and seasonal farm workers,’ that does not mean somebody who just arrived from Venezuela or something. It means essentially people who are authorized to work in the United States,” says a DOL employee familiar with the program. “Maybe there's some misunderstanding even among the DOGE guys.”\nAccording to the source, access to the NFJP’s system could provide the Social Security numbers of every person who is a beneficiary of the program, as well as what kind of services a beneficiary received. (Social Security numbers are assigned to US citizens as well as immigrants legally residing and working in the country.)\nThis kind of data, says the source, is normally “very, very controlled.”\nInstructions to grant Moghaddassi access to data from the DOL’s Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) reporting system were also viewed by WIRED. FLAG is responsible for a number of initiatives, including wage protections for foreign workers and visa programs for foreign and temporary workers. Data on visa applicants maintained in FLAG systems, sources say, could include names, work addresses, work history, phone numbers, email addresses, and an “alien registration number,” which is an identifier assigned to foreign nationals by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). These numbers can be found on green cards, or permanent resident cards, and employment authorization cards. Permanent Labor Certifications (PERM) are also available in the FLAG system. The certification, according to the Labor Department’s website, “allows an employer to hire a foreign worker to work permanently” in the US.\nThe instructions to grant Moghaddassi data access to FLAG appeared under a heading that reads “OIG access level,” which likely refers to the DOL’s Office of Inspector General. The OIG at the DOL, according to its website, “investigates fraud, waste, and abuse related to the department's programs, including the foreign labor certification programs.” FLAG is the application portal for these certification programs. Larry Turner, the former Inspector General at the Department of Labor, was fired by Trump in January as part of a broader purge of the position across more than a dozen agencies. Trump has since nominated Anthony D’Esposito, a former US congressman from New York, for the job.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86 and Vittoria89.82.\nDOGE’s access at the DOL also encompasses data that, while not directly immigration-related, could be used in conjunction with data that is. Collins, Moghaddassi, and Elez all have access to the DOL’s Reentry Employment Opportunities (REO) program, WIRED has confirmed. This program at the DOL provides funding for people who were incarcerated and supports job training and other employment services.\nWhile the REO database isn’t immigration-specific, the data from REO could be cross-referenced with other datasets to figure out the immigration status of formerly incarcerated people benefiting from the program. If DOGE were to find crossover, a source at the agency tells WIRED, this “would fit so neatly with their messaging about immigrants being criminals and abusing government services.” (Despite claims from Trump’s administration, there is no evidence that immigrants present threats to “national security” and “public safety” or that they abuse government services—in fact, research shows that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the US.)\nMoghaddassi, Elez, and Collins did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did the Department of Labor.\nMoghaddassi and Elez have also appeared as DOGE operatives at other federal agencies and have connections to Musk.\nMoghaddassi has worked at a number of Musk’s companies, including X, Tesla, and Neuralink; according to previous WIRED reporting tracking DOGE operatives, he has also been linked to the Treasury Department and DHS.\nElez, a 25-year-old engineer who has worked at Musk’s X and SpaceX, has also appeared at the Treasury and Social Security Administration. While at the Treasury, WIRED reported, Elez had both read and write access to sensitive Treasury systems. Elez briefly resigned from DOGE after racist comments posted by an account he was linked to were discovered by The Wall Street Journal. Elez returned to DOGE after Musk and Vice President JD Vance posted in defense of him on X.\nElez is also staffed at DHS, according to Politico, as part of the administration’s effort to bring together data from a number of government agencies to streamline and systematize DHS enforcement and deportation. Elez, despite his initial resignation from DOGE, has seemingly been tasked with a number of unusually sensitive assignments: He is also part of the DOGE team working on a system to sell the $5 million visas that Trump calls “gold cards.”\nElez is on this team with Edward Coristine, the young DOGE operative known as “Big Balls.” Coristine also has his hands in many agencies and recently appeared at the Labor Department, sources tell WIRED.\nCoristine is another key DOGE staffer planted at DHS. He has also appeared at the Office of Personnel Management, the United States Agency for International Development, the Department of Education, the General Services Administration, and the Small Business Administration.\nCoristine did not reply to requests for comment.\n“This is an administration that is happy to go after people with legal status if it dislikes something else about them,” says Victoria Noble, a staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “It's just one more source of information that allows this administration to target people who are here legally, but target them for deportation or other more advanced investigations.”",

    "content_text": "A federal judge ruled today that Google is a monopolist in some parts of the online advertising market, marking the second case in a year where the company was found to have violated US antitrust law. Last August, a federal judge ruled that Google was maintaining an illegal monopoly in search.\nJudge Leonie Brinkema of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia determined that Google illegally monopolized parts of its advertising technology business to dominate the programmatic ad market, a major source of revenue for the company. Google generated nearly $30.4 billion in worldwide revenue last year from placing ads on other apps and websites. Now, a substantial portion of those sales are threatened by penalties that may follow Brinkema’s ruling. A best-case scenario for US consumers is a browsing experience filled with fewer ads and paywalls and more content choices.\n“In addition to depriving rivals of the ability to compete, [Google’s] exclusionary conduct substantially harmed Google’s publisher customers, the competitive process, and, ultimately, consumers of information on the open web,” Brinkema wrote.\nGoogle was found to have violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the cornerstone antitrust law in the US, “by willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power in the open-web display publisher ad server market and the open-web display ad exchange market, and has unlawfully tied its publisher ad server (DFP) and ad exchange (AdX).” In other words, the way that Google tied parts of its ad tech together was deemed unlawful.\nOnline ads end up in front of consumers after passing through a chain of systems linking publishers to advertisers. Google has long been viewed as a dominant provider of tools at nearly every step in this process, which critics argue enables the company to give preferential treatment to its own systems and box out competitors.

Ho ho. Trump and Musk have got to go.\nMichael Calore: People are taking to the streets to challenge President Donald Trump's most recent policy changes, some of which have been created with the aid of Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency.\n[Archival audio]: All 50 states saw these so-called hands-off rallies and so did a few cities in Europe.\nMichael Calore: The first hands-off protests occurred earlier this month. The Tesla Takedown demonstrations have been rolling for weeks, and from the feel of it, we're looking at a summer full of protests. So today we're talking about the risks of being surveilled by law enforcement during protests. We'll talk about how surveillance tech is being used, how it's evolved over the years, and what it means for anyone taking to the streets or posting to social media to voice their concerns. This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people power and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: And I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: Katie Drummond is out today, but we're joined by WIRED's senior editor of security and investigations, Andrew Couts.\nAndrew Couts: Thanks so much for having me.\nMichael Calore: So let's start by talking about what's going on right now. There are the hands-off protests, there are the Tesla Takedown protests. Are these related at all?\nLauren Goode: The hands-off protests and the Tesla Takedown movement are not the same, but they are related. They're both in some way resisting some of the policies that Donald Trump has quickly enacted without congressional approval in the short time since he took office in January. Tesla Takedown is pegged directly at Elon Musk who has this official but unofficial role in Trump's administration as the leader of DOGE. We sometimes refer to him as the Buddy in Chief, and the idea there is to challenge Musk's power as one of the world's richest men by devaluing one of his most important businesses in the private sector, which is Tesla, whereas the hands-off protests are about all kinds of things. They're protesting the firing of federal workers, the overreaching and potentially unconstitutional immigration policies, threats to women's rights and LGBTQ rights, threats to social security, threats to health care. The list goes on. The idea is basically get your hands off my rights.\nMichael Calore: And how are the protests looking?\nLauren Goode: They're fairly significant. Tesla Takedown is a grassroots movement that started outside of Tesla dealerships in showrooms back in February and has been happening on an ongoing basis and has gotten quite a bit of attention. Hands-off had its biggest day so far on April 5th I think, and organizers said that there were more 1,300 rallies of varying sizes across the United States on that Saturday. And if you haven't heard of these rallies or seen the sizes of the crowds that people like AOC and Bernie Sanders have been pulling in, then I would seriously question the media that you're consuming because this is really happening.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, there's been really striking footage of people walking in Manhattan and just wall to wall people down one of the major avenues just for like a mile.\nLauren Goode: Right, and not AI generated.\nMichael Calore: The people who are out taking the streets and engaging in their constitutional right of free speech and assembly, what are they worried about?\nLauren Goode: I can't speak for everyone, and I want to toss this to Andrew because I think Andrew's going to give us the real meat here in terms of digital surveillance, but I would just say that I think with any protest, even before we all had smartphones and there were surveillance cameras everywhere, on every street corner, in every train station, you always had to weigh the risks of doing the surveilling as in being a watchdog of the powerful and questioning abuses of power and civil rights versus being surveilled at the same time you're doing it, but because we live in this digital world now, I think surveillance really is one of the biggest threats today. Andrew, do you want to say more about that?\nAndrew Couts: Yeah, I mean surveillance is just constant, and we are all being surveilled constantly if you have a smartphone or are just on the internet. So whether someone is being surveilled at a protest, the answer is a hundred percent yes, especially if they have their phone with them, and there's obviously other types of surveillance, but I think one of the things that you have to think about if you're going to engage in any type of protest and engage in your First Amendment right to speak out against whatever you want to speak out against is that it's not just what's happening at the protest that matters, it's also the constant surveillance that's happening of your social media feeds or any other types of publishing you might do online. You really need to be thinking about your entire life and your entire data footprint and how that's going to be contextualized within you being at a protest. The other thing I'd be worried about is bad actors or anybody committing crimes while you're at that protest, there's a difference between going and exercising your constitutional rights and committing crimes. And I think these days those two get conflated a lot, especially after the 2020 protests where there was a lot of vandalism and violence, and the protesters and the people committing crimes get all lumped together. It's very easy to lump people together these days. I feel like that's happening on an official level in terms of immigration right now with the Department of Justice, the State Department categorizing anybody who they deem problematic as a criminal outright, or canceling visas because somebody spoke out against the war in Gaza. These things are all getting conflated, and so you don't necessarily have power over how you're going to be perceived if you go to a protest and something happens or somebody just decides to characterize that activity in a way that's inaccurate but is potentially consequential for your life.\nMichael Calore: And to get into how exactly that conflation happens, I want to talk a little bit about how devices and certain signals on social media are used in order to identify you and identify you as a certain type of person or a person who was somewhere. So let's talk specifically about the phone for a minute. What specifically does the phone do to identify you?\nAndrew Couts: So there's a few ways. The first is, even if you had no apps on your phone except for the phone app basically, probably even not then, if you just have the device with you and it's powered on, your phone is going to be pinging nearby cell towers, it's going to ping whatever the tower is that has the highest signal that's close to you and that power is going to be collecting your device ID and the time and date when your phone pinged the tower. And so that information can easily be obtained by police with subpoenas and anything to get just whatever devices were pinging a specific tower. So that's one way. The other way is through the apps on your phone. We've done a ton of reporting at WIRED about the ways in which advertising data, which can be collected in a few different ways, but is often collected through developer kits, or SDKs, and these can often include very, very precise location data, down to which parking spot you parked your car in front of a Home Depot or something. It can be extremely precise, and it's constant. And so as long as your phone is on and is communicating with any server that's connected to an SDK on whatever random apps on your phone, that data is then being backed up and used typically to serve you ads, but it can also be purchased by governments, it can be purchased by police departments or anybody, me or you, if you have the money to buy that data and you can see exactly where someone was at a specific time or at least you can see where the device was. And so it's not too difficult to kind of figure out where somebody was at any certain time if you have your device. And so that's one of the main reasons that having a phone with you at a protest, you got to make that decision about whether that's the best choice.\nMichael Calore: Right. The idea is that as you move around in the world, if law enforcement wants to sort of draw any sort of conclusions about what kind of person you are and who you hang out with and what sorts of places you go, it's relatively easy for them to do so.\nAndrew Couts: Yeah, absolutely. And the fact is that they're not going to just be using one or the other. They're going to be using basically every tool available to them. So that can include other people's social media posts that show you in photographs or videos. It's going to be police body cameras, it's going to be your own social media posts or statements saying that you were at a certain place at a certain time, and so it's all going to be used together to show like, yes, this person was at X place at X time.\nLauren Goode: What is your advice then for sharing the social media from a protest, particularly since social media can be an important tool for getting a message out or letting people know there is a rally happening?\nAndrew Couts: When making these decisions, it's really depends on your risk threshold. I think if you are really concerned about your safety and maybe your immigration status or your ability to live freely in the United States, I would definitely limit your exposure to other people's social media posts, meaning wear a mask if you're able to, cover up any identifying features or make sure you don't have your name on your shirt or anything like that. And definitely don't post to your own social media about the protest if you're really concerned about that. Not everybody's risk levels are going to be the same though. Maybe getting the word out is the most important thing to you, maybe that's your job, but it is definitely something to factor in that you are almost certainly going to be subjected to other people's video and photos and you need to take that into consideration before you decide to go to a protest or how you decide to conduct yourself there.\nMichael Calore: So if we can assume that what you're doing online and not only moving around in the world, but the things that you're doing online are being monitored, then what about your private conversations? What about if you're using Twitter DMs or if you're on Facebook and you're private messaging with people on Facebook?\nLauren Goode: Or WhatsApp or any of the Facebook-owned apps?\nMichael Calore: Yeah, sure. Is it possible for those types of things to also be exposed through like a subpoena? Basically my question here is, are tech companies protecting us in any way against governments prying into our DMs?\nAndrew Couts: So there's a difference between active surveillance and passive surveillance, especially when we're talking about social media. There are companies that are constantly collecting everything that is posted publicly online about a particular keyword or a hashtag or anything like that. So anytime you're posting about a certain protest or a certain political thing, you might be getting subjected to some kind of surveillance there, but it's very passive. You're part of many people who are talking about a thing presumably, and it's not targeted at you. Then there's active surveillance where you are a subject of an investigation or you're a person of interest to authorities, and that can be much more invasive. So if somebody suspects that you say set a car on fire at a protest, you may be subjected to subpoenas or your communications may be subjected to subpoenas or warrants, search warrants, and the sky's the limit on how much the police are going to be able to get about your communications if you are subjected to a police investigation or some other government investigation. So those might not be subjected to it because those messages are much more limited in their availability. So that's going to be a big difference in terms of whether you're just at a protest, nothing has happened, you're just posting about stuff on social media that's just going to be probably passively surveilled in one degree or another. If you're subject to an active investigation, that's a much more serious type of surveillance, and you're in a much more serious situation.\nMichael Calore: There are several companies in Silicon Valley that specialize in surveillance technology. They basically make products that law enforcement and governments can use to surveil people. So I think we should identify some of them. Who are the big names here?\nLauren Goode: Well, there are some companies that are specifically in data intelligence, and I think the Silicon Valley company that comes to mind for most people is Palantir. Palantir is building ICE's case management software. That's just one example. There's also Clearview AI, which is a face-recognition company, and then there are data aggregators like Data Miner, and then of course there's the whole network of other tech companies too, whether they're chipmakers like Nvidia or Intel or they're cloud service providers like Amazon that directly or indirectly power some of the systems that governments around the world would use in their surveillance technology, if you want to call it a surveillance technology, but there are different contexts for all of these too. For example, Andrew, one of the things that you mentioned in your video series Incognito Mode is you call out Data Miner, but you also say, \"But as a journalist I've used that too.\"\nAndrew Couts: Yeah, I mean there's a lot of overlap with what reporters do, what journalists do, and what other types of investigators do. You're trying to get the information and connect dots and try to see what you can prove. And so the motivation or the end product of that is going to be very different depending on what your job is. The thing, I think anybody using them regardless of why is just how powerful they are and how much data we're all producing all the time. And I think Data Miner is a good example. It's really one of the main ways that social media is surveilled, and I think when we're talking about social media, we're not just talking about X and Instagram and TikTok, we're talking about all of those plus Reddit forums, everything where there's user participation online is often getting sucked up into these tools as long as those posts are publicly available. A lot of these companies, they're now using AI to perform additional data analysis, at least on these conversations that are happening online and kind of flagging things to say, “This looks like it's maybe a threat,” or “This looks like it maybe falls into whatever parameters that an investigator of any type wants to look into.” And so we're taking the human element out of it so it's not just some guy watching your Bluesky feed, it is a computer watching everybody's Bluesky feed and then using AI to flag that for human beings who can then maybe look into it further.\nIt's happening constantly. We just have to assume everything you post, even if you delete it, whatever, it's all being vacuumed up into these big data tools and then potentially used by authorities in whatever way they're going to use them. And I think the biggest change from say the 2020 protests is we don't know how they're going to be used, what the authorities are going to be going after, what they could go after a year from now. And so when we're talking about assessing our own personal risks, that has to be at the forefront of it, that we don't know what's going to matter or what's going to be a problem or what's going to even be a crime within the near future.\nMichael Calore: Let's go back in time a little bit, about five years ago to be exact. It's May 2020 and we're in the first year of the pandemic and George Floyd has been murdered by police in Minneapolis. This sparks nationwide an international protest. It also sparked a huge conversation about surveillance technology and how it was being used to monitor protesters. And Andrew, you wrote a story around this time about how hundreds of protesters in New York were arrested and eventually won a landmark settlement against the city of New York. Can you tell us about it and where the surveillance tech came in?\nAndrew Couts: Yeah, so this is an interesting case where the police body cam footage was ultimately used against the police department in the form of a lawsuit because the plaintiffs in this case and their legal team were able to gather, I think around 6,300 videos from protests around the New York City and use the body cam footage to document instances of police abuse in various ways against the protesters. And so they were able to win millions of dollars by doing this, and they were using the body cam footage that the police were capturing themselves. This is one instance where the system worked how it was supposed to in certain ways. They also used a tool that allowed them to go through this many, many hours of footage to be able to pinpoint instances of police use of force, use of pepper spray, other types of police infractions against the protesters. So it was really an interesting use of surveillance technology used against the police themselves as well as custom big data tools that are able to make sense of all this data, because that's a lot of times when we're talking about surveilling protests, we're talking about just massive, massive amounts of data, and the data doesn't matter unless you're able to make some sense of it. And so I think the tools that are used to analyze big batches of data are just as important as the tools capturing the activity or the speech or whatever it is themselves.\nMichael Calore: Back at the time of the 2020 protests, one of the tools that was used to identify who was in a specific location was a geofence warrant. How have geofence warrants evolved since 2020?\nAndrew Couts: First, let's just start with what a geofence warrant is. A geofence warrant essentially allows law enforcement to go to a tech company and ask for every device that was in a specific location and give us all the devices that were in that location at a specific time. Now, very often police departments would go to Google for this, because Google's apps are on so many people's phones or Google makes people's phones, and so they're going to have the most data. They're going to probably get something on every single person who had a phone in that location, in that geofence area. Google has since said that it's no longer going to provide information that way. That doesn't mean police aren't going to still be able to get that data in some form or another, but Google isn't going to just hand over this big batch of data the way it used to. And so that's one big change. They can also go to another company, they can go to TikTok, they can go to whatever. That said, there's been a couple of changes on the legal front as well. Last year there were two court rulings, one in the Fourth Circuit and one in the Fifth Circuit specifically about geofence warrants. And these court rulings looked almost identical from the beginning of the case, but the rulings were completely the opposite. So essentially the Fourth Circuit ruled that a geofence warrant, it doesn't constitute a search in the way that the fourth Amendment requires. The Fifth Circuit ruled that it does.\nMichael Calore: And as of April, the Fourth Circuit Court is actively reconsidering its stance on geofence warrants. So there's still more to come, right?\nAndrew Couts: There's still a lot of ambiguity around it, and the changes that Google made definitely impacted police ability to get that information in such a clean one-shot way, but they're still happening.\nMichael Calore: What if I'm just walking by a protest going from one bus stop to another or getting a bagel? Do I get trapped in the circle that they've drawn on the map?\nAndrew Couts: Yeah, if you're there at the specific time frame that the police have stipulated in their geofence warrant, then yeah, you would.\nMichael Calore: That's super reassuring. So we've talked a lot about police, specifically law enforcement and cities, but also the US government is collecting this information and analyzing the data that they're getting. What agencies are using these technologies to surveil people?\nAndrew Couts: We know for certain that the FBI is going to be collecting data for national security purposes. We're likely seeing Department of Homeland Security collecting a lot of data. Customs and border protection are using social media surveillance. ICE is using social media surveillance. At this point, I think you just have to assume all of them are. I mean, part of the capitalism of it all is that these companies are competing and that means prices get lower. And so it's not just one company that's offering it. It's multiple companies that are offering different surveillance platforms or technologies. And so it gets cheaper for governments to get it, and then at some point it's going to make a lot more sense for a certain agency to have it, even if five, 10 years ago they wouldn't have had it.\nMichael Calore: Let's talk now about what our listeners can do if they want to go and protest out in the streets or if they want to tweet through it, if they want to express themselves online, what measures should they take to protect themselves if they're worried about surveillance and if they feel as though they would not want to share as much information as we now know law enforcement and the government can collect on them? Now, Lauren, you coauthored a piece a few years ago and then just recently updated it with advice for people to go out and protest safely. And I know we have a few different guides on WIRED that people can read, but let's talk through some of the high-level stuff here. This question is for both of you, what are the top things that you would recommend for people who want to go out and protest in person?\nAndrew Couts: I think the top thing I would consider is whether you should bring your phone with you or not or potentially put it in a Faraday bag, which can block all signals to and from the device and limit that surveillance. That's going to be one of the greatest sources of data for anybody who wants to investigate anyone who's at a specific protest. Your phone is a surveillance machine. The best thing you can do is to throw it in the sea if you want to protect your privacy overall, but that's not practical, so consider leaving it at home. I would also be really careful about what you're posting online. If you're serious about an issue, avoid making flippant jokes that are going to be misconstrued by prosecutors basically. And don't joke about spray-painting Teslas. Don't joke about committing crimes of any kind. Don't joke about engaging in violence, because that will be used against you if something happens and you find yourself under arrest.\nMichael Calore: Would you recommend that people turn off biometrics on their phone? That's a tip I see a lot.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, that's one of our biggest pieces of advice. Turn off your face ID.\nMichael Calore: Face ID.\nLauren Goode: What do they call it on the Google phone?\nMichael Calore: They call it fingerprint detection.\nLauren Goode: Fingerprint. Sure. The idea being that if you are approached by authorities, and this goes for if you're even traveling through an airport by the way, and you're concerned that you might be detained, the idea is that someone could basically hold the phone up to your face or force you to unlock it versus using a numeric passcode.\nMichael Calore: What stops somebody from holding up your phone and saying, “Plug in your passcode”?\nAndrew Couts: You can also just say, “I am exercising my right to remain silent,” and you can say, “I'm exercising my Fifth Amendment rights.” That's the law, which that advice actually stems is because police can't tell you to turn over evidence against yourself, which is ostensibly what a password is if they go in your phone and find something there. I think that advice is especially important. You mentioned airports, but the ACLU has pointed out the so-called 100-mile zone, which is a hundred miles from any US border or any ocean where ICE and other immigration authorities can basically just search anybody for any reason. You just have to be much more cognizant of that. And if you're in the US on a visa, I'd be really, really careful about that because we've seen people who are here perfectly legally, and then their visas get just canceled. So if for some reason you're at a protest that is deemed not within the Trump administration's OK list, you might find yourself just automatically getting your visa canceled or anything like that if you're going to a protest. So I would just add being realistic about your own personal risk thresholds and what personal risks you probably face. The answer to that is to not go, and that's also very problematic, because then you are limiting your First Amendment rights yourself and it's the chilling effect, but you have to balance those two things out. We're in kind of no man's land at the moment, and so you have to be realistic about what makes sense for your own personal life.\nMichael Calore: So Lauren, what are some of the other things that you would recommend people do to stay safe if they want to go out and protest?\nLauren Goode: Well, our guide recommends that you don't go alone. So traveling groups. I would also throw in there avoid taking your own car. Not only is your license plate likely to be scanned, but in terms of the location of your vehicle can be pinpointed specifically to a parking spot. Also, for whatever reason, if you have to get out of there sort of quickly, having to get to your car and possibly get out of a log jam doesn't make any sense. So use public transit or traveling groups. Certainly back in 2020, we saw a lot of people wearing masks during the protests because it was Covid. It was Covid times. It's still not a bad idea to wear a mask, not just for health reasons, but because it obscures some of your face and therefore less of your face is being recorded and stored somewhere. This is kind of social media hygiene, which Andrew has given us a lot of great tips on, but don't capture people's faces in photos and videos. Be considerate. If you are going to take an image, maybe shoot from behind, you can't see people's faces. Try not to capture any sort of distinctive outfits, tattoos, something that could sort of set someone apart, because you don't want to be a narc for them, basically. Use encrypted messaging once you're on the ground. I mean, I think that these are all kind of standard good safety policies. If you suspect things are really going to get pretty hairy, it's a good idea to have important phone numbers written directly on your body. We sort of joke these days about how we don't remember anyone's phone numbers in our lives. They could be the most important person in your life. It could be your partner and you're like, “I don't know anyone's phone number because it's stored in my phone.” But that can become a real issue if your stuff has been confiscated and you've been detained or arrested. A couple other things. Keep in mind the ACLU says you can protest at government buildings, but you should maybe try to stick to traditional public grounds like public streets and the sidewalks outside of government buildings. Don't block access to a government building if you're protesting. Don't do what January 6 protesters did, and Andrew mentioned your immigration status as well. But basically you really do have to consider the risks quite carefully if you are someone who is here on any kind of student visa or any kind of non-immigrant visa like an H-B or an O-I. I spoke to an immigration attorney who just said, really think twice about going. And she said, “It pains me not to tell people to exercise their First Amendment rights, but you're much more vulnerable in that situation and the risks are much higher for you.”\nMichael Calore: OK, well, this is all very good advice and I would just add to all of that: hydrate, because it's going to be a very long summer and it's going to be very hot summer, and you need to make sure that you don't pass out while you're out there.\nLauren Goode: That's good advice.\nMichael Calore: Andrew, thanks for joining us today for this conversation. It was filled with a lot of great info.

The Tesla Takedown demonstrations have been rolling for weeks, and from the feel of it, we're looking at a summer full of protests. So today we're talking about the risks of being surveilled by law enforcement during protests. We'll talk about how surveillance tech is being used, how it's evolved over the years, and what it means for anyone taking to the streets or posting to social media to voice their concerns.

There are the hands-off protests, there are the Tesla Takedown protests. Are these related at all?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> The hands-off protests and the Tesla Takedown movement are not the same, but they are related. They're both in some way resisting some of the policies that Donald Trump has quickly enacted without congressional approval in the short time since he took office in January. Tesla Takedown is pegged directly at Elon Musk who has this official but unofficial role in Trump's administration as the leader of DOGE. We sometimes refer to him as the Buddy in Chief, and the idea there is to challenge Musk's power as one of the world's richest men by devaluing one of his most important businesses in the private sector, which is Tesla, whereas the hands-off protests are about all kinds of things. They're protesting the firing of federal workers, the overreaching and potentially unconstitutional immigration policies, threats to women's rights and LGBTQ rights, threats to social security, threats to health care. The list goes on. The idea is basically get your hands off my rights.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "One of the more heated exchanges from the original Pop the Balloon or Find Love—a wildly popular YouTube show through which eligible Black singles ruthlessly assess each other’s attractiveness face-to-face—should have culminated with a lesson in humility.\nAaron, a 29-year-old plumber whose deal breakers included “being promiscuous” and “non-cleanly” had just finished insulting a woman for having too much hair on her arms when fellow contestant Kailah cut him down to size.\n“You kinda look like a Ninja Turtle, you’re not that cute, you need to relax, and you're stocky as hell,” Kailah said as the other women erupted in applause and cheers. Rather than backing down, though, Aaron shot back: “You’re not even qualified to be dealing with me,” before bragging that he had more money than her.\nThe moment, like many of the exchanges on the show, brings its appeal into sharp focus: Pop the Balloon doesn’t hold back. Set in a no-frills, stark-white studio, with many slow-motion fit checks, the show is candid and vulnerable, often ridiculous, and sometimes problematic. It is the antithesis of a highly produced dating franchise like The Bachelor—but people have come to love that lack of polish; the show averages around 2 million viewers per episode and was recently parodied on Saturday Night Live.\nBut much of the authenticity that fans loved was absent from Netflix's reboot, a live version called Pop the Balloon Live, which debuted last week, hosted by comedian Yvonne Orji of Insecure and featuring reality stars and contestants of all races. That episode is already dealing with accusations that it’s “watered down” and amounts to “a paper bag test.” Which raises the question, what does a show lose, especially one that is anchored in Black culture, when it widens its scope to include everyone?\n“Of course Netflix added DEIs,” @camsimply joked on Bluesky upon hearing about the new version.\n“We can’t have NOTHING!” @princey5ive responded.\n“They gentrified Pop the Balloon … UGH,” @richgirlenergy_ posted on X.\nIt’s “a tragedy,” one Netflix executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity, tells WIRED of the premiere, saying it wouldn’t be surprising if the team that works on the show makes several adjustments given the overwhelming negative response.\nNetflix did not respond to requests for comment.\nLaunched in December 2023 by Bolia Matundu and Arlette Amuli, who also acts as host, Pop the Balloon has followed the same bare-bones approach to finding love across its 51 episodes. A group of single women or men stand shoulder to shoulder in a line, each holding a red balloon and a toothpick. They are introduced to a prospective suitor who must ask and answer questions (“What’s your love language?”; “Do you have kids?”). Although the show features people of all backgrounds—entrepreneurs, doctors, educators, engineers, even alleged scammers—the contestants are predominantly Black, straight, and Christian.\nIf at any time the contestants don’t like what they hear or see, they can self-elminate by popping their balloon but must explain why they did. Maybe contestants felt he was too short, or they didn’t like the sound of her voice; explanations run the gamut, but lack of physical attraction is the most common deal-breaker. Episodes have a tendency to veer into slapstick when a suitor has just walked on stage, hasn’t spoken a word, and sets off a chain-reaction of popped balloons. Depending on the emotional temperature of contestants, interviews can erupt into arguments over shallow beauty standards, like a large forehead, “crusty” lips, or a “Willy Wonka”–style hat.\nWhile the original has been called out for portraying a surface-level representation of Black dating culture, those unique elements are also what many fans have come to appreciate about it.\nNetflix announced that it was taking the series “to the next level” in a new live format and likely has a much bigger budget than the original, but so far it hasn’t gone over well.\nThe series premiere kicked off with a young white woman unironically rapping about being an honors student within the first 10 minutes. Veteran reality TV star Johnny Bananas, 42, from MTV’s The Challenge, was the first lucky suitor but soured on the women right away. In one exchange, which initially seemed to be directed at a Black contestant, he said that her feet looked like she “sleeps from a tree upside down.” The next day he attempted to clear up his statement on X, writing: “Hey morons, I was actually talking about the WHITE girl whose toes were hanging over her shoes who is literally dressed like a fucking tree!”\nThe live version is being produced by Sharp Entertainment, the company behind 90 Day Fiancé and Love After Lockup. “This new iteration builds on the original’s core concept while pushing the boundaries of connection, chemistry, and unpredictability,” executive producer Matt Sharp said in a statement.\nExactly what Sharp means by “pushing boundaries” isn’t entirely clear given the heft of Netflix’s influence and the impact the company has had in remaking the future of Hollywood. A more palatable version of Pop the Balloon isn’t necessarily a better one. In fact, Netflix is one of the few streamers, maybe the only streamer, that can take a genuine shot on culturally niche projects because of how much reach and brand awareness the company has.\n“I don’t understand why they adapted it, and I don’t really get why it would be a smart play for them. What audience is it going to serve?” a former development lead at Paramount, who also wanted to remain unnamed, tells WIRED. “It really feels like less of a creative evolution and more of a reactionary attempt to fill the gap in live content. I wouldn’t be surprised if a white senior executive at Netflix saw this and assumed Black audiences would rally around it or that they could get white audiences and other audiences to care about it.”\nEveryone’s chasing the next breakout format, and the instinct to capitalize on a viral hit is not a wrong one—that’s just smart business—but maybe what gets lost in that pursuit, as a product moves from a user-generated platform to one without full creative control, is the secret sauce that originally made the show a success.\nSharp Entertainment did not respond to a request for comment.\nEven with Netflix’s most recent push into live programming—which is very much a work in progress; critic Phillip Maciak called Everybody’s Live With John Mulaney an “ambitious mess”—you can’t help but wonder if what real boundary pushing looks like is a Pop the Balloon not all that different from the original.\nUltimately the failure of the show is a problem of translation, says Stephane Dunn, chair of the Cinema, Television, and Emerging Media Studies Department at Morehouse College. “The original mission of the creator is not always the concern of the streaming platform,” she says. Dunn worries that as streaming platforms have become more “content hungry,” they have discarded cultural specificity, the magic that made a show like Pop the Balloon a hit in the first place, for hollow metrics. (For now, new episodes of Amuli’s original Pop the Balloon are still being posted to YouTube every Wednesday.)\n“A lot of these streamers just see numbers. They go, ‘We need to confiscate that. We get that on our platform.’ But they’re not paying attention to what makes the show unique,” Dunn says. “Netflix believed they could duplicate that authenticity, but without certain makers—tone, aesthetics, a relationship to the audience—they have really just purchased a cultural skeleton of the thing.”",

    "content_text": "Seven federal workers who abruptly lost their jobs in recent weeks say they are worried that thousands of biological samples—from human urine to frozen rodent organs—may be left to rot in a government laboratory in West Virginia. The workers left behind the samples, which they say include lungs, spleens, and brains collected from rats and mice, after the Trump administration laid off or placed on administrative leave about two-thirds of the staff working at facilities managed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) earlier this month.\nThe NIOSH researchers collected the tissue samples as part of experiments to determine how Americans may be impacted by chemicals and other substances they are exposed to at their jobs. Some of the samples are stored in a refrigerator that needs to be kept at -112 Farenheit at all times, while others are stored in liquid nitrogen. Unless someone inside the federal government continues to ensure the liquid nitrogen doesn’t totally evaporate, the samples will eventually defrost and begin to rot, according to three staff researchers who work with such materials.\n“You can't really store them very long in a regular freezer—they won't be viable,” says Kyle Mandler, a toxicologist at the Morgantown NIOSH facility who was placed on administrative leave during the recent so-called reduction in force at the agency. “That clock is ticking, and every day is closer.”\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has historically overseen NIOSH, referred WIRED’s questions about the fate of the samples to the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS declined to comment on the record. But hours after WIRED contacted the agency, a current NIOSH staffer said that some remaining employees were abruptly told by higher-ups that the liquid nitrogen levels were being “monitored.”\nOne NIOSH researcher who lost their job tells WIRED that if the samples aren’t left to rot, they will probably be destroyed—a process that would involve placing them into biohazard bags and paying a third-party company to incinerate them. It’s unclear what may happen to other materials in the lab, such as chemicals used in experiments. The researcher said that a large shipment of chemicals had arrived the morning of the layoffs.\nThe Morgantown facility also houses historical tissue samples, including what the CDC describes as a “‘time capsule” of diseased human lungs from black lung victims. Current and former NIOSH employees who spoke to WIRED say they are not aware of any plans for these samples. “I have seen and held those samples in my hands,” Mandler tells WIRED. “There is nothing like that tissue bank anywhere in the world.”\nCreated as part of the Occupational Safety and Health Act signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970, NIOSH is responsible for conducting research into causes of work-related injuries and deaths. It also helps inform federal workplace regulations, such as safe exposure levels for various toxic substances.\nIn late March, HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that NIOSH would be moved from the CDC to a new entity called the “Administration for a Healthy America” as part of a “dramatic restructuring” plan that would involve eliminating 10,000 full-time employees at HHS.\nCathy Tinney-Zara, a worker at NIOSH’s Morgantown facility who spoke to WIRED in her capacity as the union representative, says that before they lost their jobs, the researchers at the facility had been actively studying how Gulf War soldiers were affected by exposure to Mustard Gas, how pregnant workers have been affected by exposure to PFAS chemicals, and how manufacturing workers contract lung fibrosis after inhaling nanoparticles.\nTwo Morgantown researchers—who like others in this story, asked to remain anonymous to avoid professional repercussions—say that their laid-off colleagues were also researching how agricultural workers are impacted by inhaling dust from hemp plants, and a possible link between exposure to chemical disinfectants and asthma. The lab was also about to begin developing a rapid toxicity test for chemicals that US troops may be exposed to while they are deployed.\nMandler says he was researching why some people who manufacture, cut, and install stone countertops were starting to get silicosis—a potentially fatal lung scarring and inflammation disease that makes it difficult to breathe—after just a few years on the job. Generally, he says, workers tend to get the disease after spending decades in the field.\n“I have listened to men younger than me sit across the table and talk about how they feel like they're drowning in their own lungs because of these exposures, and they can’t see their children grow up,” Mandler says.\nHe adds that some of the NIOSH staffers who lost their jobs were testing how lung tissue reacts after being exposed to the dust from different brands of commercial synthetic quartz. The material, commonly used in countertops, is thought to cause more severe lung damage than exposure to pure natural quartz, Mandler says. He believes something in the manufacturing process may be to blame, but now that his research team at NIOSH has been dismantled, Mandler fears it will take longer for the scientific community to find the root cause.\nThree Morgantown researchers who were affected by the job cuts tell WIRED that they have not received any information about who would be in charge of the facility’s biological samples after the reduction in force, how custody of them could be transferred, or what their ultimate fate may be. Since entire divisions at NIOSH were eliminated, one researcher says, they don’t even know who could take responsibility for the samples they oversaw at the facility.\nAnother researcher says that when the layoffs happened, the only instruction they received was “to destroy our purchase and travel cards, and maintenance was available to help us take personal items to our cars.”\nThe researcher says that CDC guidelines direct employees to keep physical samples and accompanying personally identifiable information under lock and key, and only certain authorized staff are permitted to access them. “My colleagues and I took this responsibility very seriously,” the researcher tells WIRED. “Many are worried about samples and what will become of them, sensitive and otherwise.”\nEven before the recent reduction in force, Mandler and two other laid-off researchers say that a federal spending freeze ordered by the Trump administration in January had reduced the Morgantown facility’s supply of liquid nitrogen to “critical” levels. It took several weeks to restart the shipments.\nIn addition to samples taken from rodents, NIOSH’s frozen tissues include commercially produced immortalized cell lines—cells that can proliferate indefinitely and enable small tissue samples to grow into larger ones that can more easily be experimented on. Mandler tells WIRED that one small vial of immortalized cells cost about $600, and his team alone had almost 100 of them ready to use before they abruptly got laid off. Across all of the different research teams at NIOSH, Mandler estimates that the frozen vials and tissue samples they have bought would be worth “millions of dollars” in total.\nThe mice and rat cells come from live animals housed directly inside the Morgantown facility, which are usually cared for by a veterinarian and other support staff. The lab’s Morgantown’s attending veterinarian, Stephen Harvey, also lost his job as part of the reduction in force, according to a comment he made on LinkedIn.\nMandler says that, despite losing his job, Harvey has continued to work and care for the animals. Harvey declined an interview request from WIRED, but said in a LinkedIn message that the lab has “not euthanized any animals” and is trying to “find good solutions for them.” Tinney-Zara says that about 600 of the approximately 700 rodents at the Morgantown lab have been relocated to a nearby university.\nOne researcher at NIOSH’s Pittsburgh facility—whose work has focused on developing and modifying machines for monitoring the amount of dust and chemicals in the air—says they fear expensive instruments purchased by the government could also go to waste across different NIOSH facilities.\nThe researcher says that hundreds of machines in NIOSH’s Pittsburgh facility, many of which are worth tens of thousands of dollars, have to be used, calibrated, and serviced frequently in order to continue working properly. They point specifically to a device called an x-ray diffractometer, an instrument for identifying the elements in small physical samples, which they say is supposed to run constantly.\nFrom their firsthand experience during Covid, the researcher says they know that fixing a long-dormant machine is expensive and can take many weeks, if it succeeds at all. Now, they worry that these instruments, and their specialized testing capabilities, will be abandoned and go to waste.\n“We could be in a situation to leave behind millions of dollars of equipment and infrastructure in the labs,” the researcher tells WIRED.\nCorrection 4/17/25 5:13 PM EDT: This story has been updated to clarify the specific National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health facility where one quoted worker is employed.",

    "content_text": "Anti-vaccine activists with close ties to US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are falsely claiming that the measles public health crisis in Texas is caused by a “bioweapon” targeting the Mennonite community. These activists are now trying to sell their followers a range of pseudoscientific cures—some purportedly powered by artificial intelligence—that supposedly prevent customers from contracting measles.\nThe claims were made in a webinar posted online last week and hosted by Mikki Willis, an infamous conspiracy filmmaker best known for his Plandemic series of pseudo-documentaries. These helped supercharge Covid-19 disinformation online and were, Kennedy has said, funded in part by Children’s Health Defense (CHD), an anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded. Willis also created a video for Kennedy marking the announcement of his independent run for the presidency.\n“I’m not going to be careful by calling it a virus,” Willis said in the measles webinar. “I’m going to call it what it is, and that is a bioweapon, and my belief after interviewing these families is that this has been manipulated and targeted towards a community that is a threat because of their natural way of living.” (Measles is not a bioweapon. It is a viral infection that can be easily prevented by getting a vaccine.)\nThe webinar was hosted by Rebel Lion, the supplement company that Willis cofounded. On the website, and prominently featured under the webinar, Willis sells and recommends a “measles treatment and prevention protocol” full of supplements and tools on the site. On the webinar, Willis claimed the protocol will help parents “get prepped for, if God forbid this does get out, and their children get sick.” Together, purchasing the full protocol costs hundreds of dollars.\n“This is the standard radical anti-vaccine extremist playbook,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, tells WIRED. “You can see RFK Jr. has translated his anti-vaccine lies into political power. You can see others have converted it into economic power. And there’s some that just do it because it makes them feel good to be listened to, to be important, to be the center of a community. There’s always an ulterior motive.”\nThe community Willis refers to in the webinar is the Mennonite community in Seminole, a small city in west Texas, which has been the epicenter of the measles outbreak. Over 560 measles cases have been reported in Texas alone. To date, the deaths of two children have been linked to the measles outbreak, and another death is under investigation.\nWillis’ bogus claim about a bioweapon is part of a larger effort by the anti-vaccine community to undermine the threat posed by the infection. Many, instead, have claimed that the measles deaths were caused by other diseases or, in some cases, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine itself. These claims are not true and “there have been no deaths shown to be related to the MMR vaccine in healthy people,” according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\nThe claims have been facilitated, in part, by Kennedy, whose response to the outbreak has been widely criticized by public health officials. Kennedy has seemingly attempted a balancing act in his response to this crisis, accurately saying the MMR vaccine is “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” before undermining this statement days later by claiming, without evidence, that the effectiveness of the vaccine wanes by 5 percent every year.\nKennedy last month, in an interview on Fox News, also praised doctors who have been using alternative and unproven treatments within the Mennonite community. Among those doctors is Richard Bartlett, who also appeared on Willis’ webinar last week and is credited on the Rebel Lion site with sharing the measles “protocol” package for purchase.\n“Not only are we going to talk to Dr. Bartlett about what’s happening and what he’s seen there on the front lines, but he’s also going to share what he’s been using and the protocols that he’s been using to treat his patients,” Willis said in the webinar.\nOn the webinar, Bartlett pushed unproven measles treatments like the steroid budesonide and the antibiotic clarithromycin. He also urged viewers to buy a range of pseudoscientific treatments. Along with mouthwash, supplemental oxygen, and a few other items, the measles protocol includes Rebel Lion’s own Fierce Immunity capsules, which cost $50 for a single bottle and contain a blend of five supplements available off the shelf that the company claims have been formulated with a supposed AI technology known as Swarm Intelligence. Swarm Intelligence was created by Anton Fliri, who says he has worked as a cancer researcher at Pfizer in the past. Fliri told Willis in a webinar last August that unlike regular AI, his technology “is the natural form of intelligence, that’s the way our brain works, that’s the way our body works and it doesn’t hallucinate because everything we are doing is based on reality, based on the real evidence.”\nWillis, Bartlett, Rebel Lion, and Fliri, who also appeared on last week’s webinar, did not respond to requests for comment.\nWillis’ attempt to cash in on an ongoing public health crisis is reminiscent of a strategy that has been playing out for decades in the anti-vaccine community and was seen most recently during the Covid-19 pandemic. Anti-vaccine influencers and groups like America’s Frontline Doctors pushed the baseless claim that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were viable treatments for Covid-19, encouraging followers to spend millions of dollars on these products.\nFrom the very beginning of the measles outbreak in Texas, the anti-vaccine community has sought to undermine the threat posed by the disease, presenting false narratives about what caused the deaths and the dangers of the MMR vaccine.\nCentral to this push has been Children’s Health Defense. Within hours of the first child’s death reported in Lubbock, Texas, on February 25, the Defender, CHD’s news publication, published an article citing several unsubstantiated text messages from medical professionals suggesting that the child had not died of measles.\nCHD has also pushed the debunked claim that vitamin C offers protections against contracting measles. The group’s website is currently promoting an ebook titled The Measles Book: Thirty-Five Secrets the Government and the Media Aren’t Telling You about Measles and the Measles Vaccine. The foreword of the book is written by Kennedy, who is now the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).\nCHD, Kennedy, and the HHS did not respond to requests for comment.\nOn X, anti-vaccine influencers claimed without evidence that hospital employees had mistreated the first patient, leading to their death. One of those pushing this narrative was Syed Haider, a doctor who was part of the notorious Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), which formed during the pandemic and pushes dubious and ineffective treatments. Haider has almost 170,000 followers. Henry Ealy, a naturopathic doctor based in Oregon with 50,000 X followers, also pushed this claim. Ealy’s 2022 report falsely claiming that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had altered records to boost deaths linked to Covid-19 has been cited in the past by CHD.\nMarissa Brooke Alesi, an influencer known as Red Pill Patriot, posted a video on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook claiming the child was hospitalized for pneumonia and RSV. “They then proceeded to give that child the MMR vaccination,” Alesi says, suggesting that the use of the MMR vaccine contributed to the child’s death. The video has been viewed over 3 million times on Instagram alone.\nHaider, Ealy, and Alesi did not respond to requests for comment.\nPierre Kory, a doctor best known for his role as the founder of FLCC and a central figure promoting ivermectin as a treatment for Covid-19, has also been pushing the narrative that measles was not the cause of the deaths of two children in Texas. In recent weeks, he has claimed without evidence that the measles crisis was, in fact, a targeted attack on the Mennonite community.\nIn August of last year, the American Board of Internal Medicine revoked Kory’s certifications; just a month earlier, Kennedy described Kory as a “brave dissident doctor.”\n“Do you want to know the real story on this case?” Kory told a physician and activist last month. “Several of us believe that they weaponized this measles virus—on purpose. She got sicker from this measles probably because they monkeyed with the virus.”\nKory did not respond to a request for comment.\nKory has called Willis a “friend,” and the pair have collaborated multiple times in the past on webinars and podcasts. In 2023, Willis turned Kory’s War on Ivermectin book into a documentary.\nWillis also claimed in the webinar that he has been given exclusive access to the Mennonite community in Texas after Bartlett convinced community members to speak only to him and people from CHD, and to avoid speaking to members of the mainstream media, who Willis described as “vultures.” Willis said he has interviewed at least 20 people for a short documentary that will be released in the coming days.\n“This is a very contemporary example of very old tropes, which is that an extremist who's seeking to radicalize someone else, separates them from people that might persuade them otherwise, whether that’s doctors, family, community, journalists who might be asking them questions to expose what's happening,” Ahmed says. “You need to separate them out so you can indoctrinate them without impediment.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nYou only get one pair of ears, so it’s a good idea to look after them—and a good set of earplugs can come in handy in all kinds of situations. A proper set is a much better solution for blocking out noise during the night than a pillow over the head and is more comfortable than headphones. What you’re looking for in earplugs really depends on what you want them to do. When you’re sleeping, for example, comfort is paramount. Plus, you need an indiscriminate approach to blocking out snores, traffic noise, or a car alarm down the street.\nIf you’re watching a band play live, though, you want to maintain as much fidelity as possible and just cut out the frequencies that might be harmful to your hearing. The average concert pumps out about 100 decibels, but if you’ve ever seen My Bloody Valentine you’ll know some bands seem to have a personal vendetta against your ears—and continuous exposure to sounds over 85 dB can cause permanent damage to your hearing. That means it’s not possible to pick out one pair of earplugs that’ll work in every situation. Instead, we’ve picked several that satisfy different needs.\nOur current top picks, the Loop Quiet and Earpeace Pro, are both excellent passive pairs of earplugs with slightly different purposes. The Loop Quiet are great for sleep, because they aim to entirely block out the outside world, while the Earpeace Pro are designed to evenly lower the sound of the world around you for when you're in loud environments but still want to hear.\nBe sure to check out our other buying guides, like the Best Sleep Gadgets, Best Wireless Earbuds, Best Wireless Headphones, and Gifts for People Who Need a Good Night’s Sleep.\nUpdated April 2025: We added the GOB mycelium earplugs, Ozlo Sleepbuds, Soundcore by Anker A20, QuietOn 4, and Apple AirPods Pro.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nWhen Should You Wear Earplugs?\nEarplugs are recommended any time sound levels exceed 85 decibels, which is comparable to a noisy restaurant or heavy traffic. Exposure to 85 decibels over 8 hours is the OSHA-approved workplace safety limit for hearing damage, which means you should be fine if you experience fewer than eight hours a that level per day. Many clubs and concert venues peak at 100+ dB, which is much too loud for prolonged exposure to be safe. Hearing loss is permanent in most cases, owing to damage to tiny hairs inside your ears.\nIf you're concerned something is too loud, put in earplugs! You can use an app (or smartwatch like an Apple Watch) to tell you how loud the environment is, if you want to be sure. It's always better to be on the safe side when it comes to noise exposure.",

The AG’s office claims it has uncovered evidence that, despite Discord’s policies to protect children and teens, the popular messaging app is putting youth “at risk.”\n“We’re the first state in the country to sue Discord,” Attorney General Matthew Platkin tells WIRED.\nPlatkin says there were two catalysts for the investigation. One is personal: A few years ago, a family friend came to Platkin, astonished that his 10-year-old son was able to sign up for Discord, despite the platform forbidding children under 13 from registering.\nThe second was the mass-shooting in Buffalo, in neighboring New York. The perpetrator used Discord as his personal diary in the lead-up to the attack and livestreamed the carnage directly to the chat and video app. (The footage was quickly removed.)\n“These companies have consistently, knowingly, put profit ahead of the interest and well-being of our children,” Platkin says.\nThe AG’s office claims in the lawsuit that Discord violated the state’s Consumer Fraud Act. The allegations, which were filed on Thursday morning, turn on a set of policies adopted by Discord to keep children younger than 13 off the platform and to keep teenagers safe from sexual exploitation and violent content. The lawsuit is just the latest in a growing list of litigation from states against major social media firms—litigation that has, thus far, proven fairly ineffective.\nDiscord’s child and teen safety policies are clear: Children under 13 are forbidden from the messaging app, while it more broadly forbids any sexual interaction with minors, including youth “self-endangerment.” It further has algorithmic filters operating to stop unwanted sexual direct messages. The California-based company’s safety policy, published in 2023, states, “We built Discord to be different and work relentlessly to make it a fun and safe space for teens.”\nBut New Jersey says “Discord’s promises fell, and continue to fall, flat.”\nThe attorney general points out that Discord has three levels of safety to prevent youth from unwanted and exploitative messages from adults: “Keep me safe,” where the platform scans all messages into a user’s inbox; “my friends are nice,” where it does not scan messages from friends; and “do not scan,” where it scans no messages.\nEven for teenage users, the lawsuit alleges, the platform defaults to “my friends are nice.” The attorney general claims this is an intentional design that represents a threat to younger users. The lawsuit also alleges that Discord is failing by not conducting age verification to prevent children under 13 from signing up for the service.\nIn 2023, Discord added new filters to detect and block unwanted sexual content, but the AG’s office says the company should have enabled the “keep my safe” option by default.\n“Consider me unimpressed by their PR campaign,” Platkin says. He contends that the new features are insufficient and easy to get around, and they are less than what the company has made available to users in other countries. “If you put lipstick on a pig,” he says, “it’s still a pig.”\nDiscord responded to WIRED's requests for comment after this story was published, writing that the company is “proud” of their efforts to protect children on their platform, and insists that they dispute the claims made in the lawsuit. “Given our engagement with the Attorney General's office, we are surprised by the announcement that New Jersey has filed an action against Discord today,” the statement reads.\n“Together, these open design features and default settings make it so that anyone can gain direct, private access to a child user with just a few clicks,” the filings allege. Later, the AG goes further, writing that “Discord promised parents safety but made deliberate choices to design its Application and establish default settings that rendered those promises utterly meaningless.”\nThe lawsuit lists a half-dozen criminal cases where adults allegedly used Discord to lure and exploited children, including the case of 764, a digital far-right pedophile ring.\nThe lawsuit proposes several different remedies, including a court injunction requiring that Discord improve its safety features and possible financial penalties if it’s found to be failing to keep its users safe.\nWhile this appears to be the first state-level lawsuit against Discord, a number of private law firms have taken aim at the company on similar grounds. In 2022, the family of a then-11-year-old girl filed a class action lawsuit against Discord, alleging that the platform failed to implement enough safeguards to prevent her exploitation by other users. A similar case was filed in California earlier this year. Both cases are ongoing.\nBut these lawsuits are growing more and more common: Meta, in particular, is facing two massive lawsuits, led by dozens of states, claiming it harmed its teenage users. A similar lawsuit was filed by a coalition of school boards in the Canadian province of Ontario. The European Union, meanwhile, has crafted a suite of regulations meant to tackle these externalities—but, thus far, it is having trouble getting the American tech giants to comply.\nPlatkin has filed a number of other lawsuits—most recently against TikTok—in an attempt to force social media giants to improve their child protection measures.\n“They can’t knowingly put out a product that’s unsafe for kids,” Platkin says. “I don’t care if you’re a social media company, or an opioid manufacturer or any other company that’s telling the public your product is safe when it’s not. We’re going to hold the company accountable.”\nPlatkin says he’s hopeful that the Trump administration, which has indicated some willingness to go after major social media companies, is interested in keeping children safe—not just targeting supposed conservative censorship. “Hope springs eternal for me,” Platkin says.\nUpdated at 3:05 pm ET: Added comment from Discord.",

With the help of the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers have detected what they believe could be biosignatures of marine microorganisms on K2-18b, an exoplanet located in the habitable zone of its parent star 124 light-years away.\nAccording to research led by the University of Cambridge, the team detected traces of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) in the planet’s atmosphere. On Earth, these compounds are produced only by microbial life such as phytoplankton.\nThe scientists admit that there is a possibility that these substances have been produced on the planet by an unknown chemical process unrelated to microorganisms. However, they also emphasize that the data represent the strongest evidence to date for possible life on a planet other than our own. The results were published in the scientific journal The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\nK2-18b is 8.6 times the mass of Earth and nearly three times its size. It lies in the direction of the constellation Leo and orbits a small, low-temperature type of star called a red dwarf. The planet is very close to its star—it takes only 33 days to complete one orbit—but due to the red dwarf’s low temperature, the planet is in a region of space that, in theory, allows liquid water to exist on its surface.\nThis exoplanet is one of the leading potential examples of a Hycean planet, a theoretical class of worlds characterized by having vast liquid oceans and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. According to astrobiologists, discovering a Hycean planet would represent one of the best opportunities to find extraterrestrial life.\nThis is not the first time that K2-18b has caught the attention of astronomers. In 2023, the same team of scientists found methane and carbon dioxide in its atmosphere. It was the first time carbon-based molecules were discovered on a planet within a habitable region of space. The researchers also identified diffuse signals at that time that looked like they could be dimethyl sulfide. And so two years later, the team took another look at the promising planet.\n“We didn’t know for sure whether the signal we saw last time was due to DMS, but just the hint of it was exciting enough for us to have another look with JWST using a different instrument,” said Nikku Madhusudhan, the scientist who led the research, in a press release.\n“Earlier theoretical work had predicted that high levels of sulfur-based gases like DMS and DMDS are possible on Hycean worlds. And now we’ve observed it, in line with what was predicted. Given everything we know about this planet, a Hycean world with an ocean that is teeming with life is the scenario that best fits the data we have,” Madhusudhan said.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "content_text": "It’s been a week since President Donald Trump imposed massive tariffs on Chinese imports to the United States, but the policies haven’t forced Amazon shoppers in the US to dig deeper into their wallets just yet. Recent data from price tracking websites reviewed by WIRED show little in the way of dramatic price hikes across most product categories on the ecommerce platform.\nOn Wednesday, the average price of goods on Amazon was higher than the previous 90 days in just nine out of 27 high-level categories monitored by the price-tracking firm Keepa, which says it collects data about billions of different items. The categories showing higher average prices included automotive, arts and crafts, and musical instruments, though the increase in nearly every group was under 1 percent.\nPrices were lower in 16 of the categories, including appliances and toys. Most of the drops amounted to less than 0.5 percent on average. Prices on Amazon fluctuate regularly for several reasons, including when sellers offer deals, and information collected by the tracking websites can help illuminate these many shifts.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said on CNBC last week that he guessed Trump’s policies would raise costs for sellers on Amazon’s marketplace, which would eventually be passed on to customers in the form of higher prices. That may very well still happen in the near future if the tariffs rates on Chinese imports remain the same or increase for other countries.\nBut at least for now, ecommerce pricing experts say there are three leading reasons why Amazon sellers are keeping their prices steady: Many still have existing inventory in the US, are fearful about violating Amazon’s pricing rules, and remain inclined to wait out the mercurial president.\n“Apart from a few isolated niche segments, we have not observed any significant price increases to date,” says Keepa CEO Julian Johann. “However, this situation may well evolve in the coming weeks and months.”\nCamelCamelCamel, another service that provides pricing history for Amazon product listings, says it has also seen prices remain largely unchanged over the last week both for premier items, such as iPads, as well as household staples, including toothpaste and peanut butter.\nThe data fit with what Dani Nadel, president and chief operating officer of Feedvisor, says she is hearing from some of the thousands of businesses that use the company’s pricing software to manage their listings on Amazon and Walmart. “Many are taking a wait-and-see approach and don’t want to act rashly,” she says, noting that some stocked up on inventory earlier this year in anticipation of the trade war.\nAbout 40 percent of the items consumers buy on Amazon are sold by the ecommerce giant itself. Independent merchants sell and price everything else—often with the help of software that can automatically adjust the prices consumers see. When multiple sellers offer the same item, those with the lowest price are more likely to be featured by Amazon and ultimately win the sale. Estimates suggest that over half of Amazon merchants are based in China, so a vast selection of goods on the platform may be vulnerable to Trump’s tariffs.\nAmazon merchants that don’t have a stockpile of goods sitting in US warehouses are in a more difficult position to absorb the impacts of Trump’s tariffs. Importing a new batch of inventory from China is going to cost significantly more, but immediately passing on the expense to shoppers could trigger alarms at Amazon.\nNadel says Amazon’s “fair pricing” rules penalize merchants, including by potentially removing their listings, if they abruptly and dramatically hike up the price of their products. The exact thresholds that can lead to a listing being removed aren’t publicly disclosed, she says, so sellers often engage in “a tenuous dance” of gradual bumps. Experts say the policy has continued to be enforced in recent days. Will Amazon eventually relax enforcement in this volatile market? “I don’t think they know yet,” Nadel says.\nAmazon declined to comment about the policy and how tariffs have generally affected prices.\nSo far, the small group of Feedvisor users that have begun accounting for the tariffs have been moving cautiously, according to Nadel. Feedvisor’s technology helps businesses dynamically adjust prices based on competing offers. But merchants can set a minimum to avoid matching outrageously low prices that would eat too far into their profit margins.\nSome sellers in categories such as toys have raised their minimum prices by 5 to 10 percent this month to ensure they can recoup tariff-related costs, Nadel says. But higher minimums generally don’t affect shoppers unless prices were already about as low as sellers could bear.\nNadel says merchants also are continuing to insert “inflation-friendly” language in their product descriptions and advertising—think phrases like “affordable luxury” and “highest quality for the fairest price”—in an effort to resonate with ever price-conscious consumers.\nAcross the internet, some companies have reportedly enacted aggressive measures in response to Trump’s trade policies, such as adding a clearly labeled tariff surcharge at checkout. Chinese ecommerce giants Temu and Shein warned customers this week that they plan to start adjusting prices on April 25 and encouraged consumers to buy items now while better deals are still available.\nIn one Facebook group for Amazon sellers viewed by WIRED, merchants have been discussing strategies they can use to avoid tariffs or recoup the cost of them. Some also wrote that they have been surprised by unusual dips and spikes in sales during this period of volatility.\nFahim Sheikh, CEO and cofounder of pricing and advertising software company Trellis, says the tariffs are posing an existential risk to some of his Amazon seller clients, who are considering going out of business. “By the time they pay their suppliers, the money they are making is thin—10 percent to 15 percent for some of these guys,” he says. “Now, tack on these additional tariffs, there’s nothing really left for them.” Sheikh is bracing for not only higher prices on Amazon if the tariffs aren’t rolled back, but also less product selection.\nMarty Mc Cay, vice president and manager at pricing tool developer Repricer, estimates that a quarter of its clients have made adjustments to their sales strategies this month. That includes raising minimum prices or halting the sale of products that no longer make financial sense. But the overall activity on Repricer’s platform has remained stable at 5 billion price adjustments per week, further suggesting that the tariffs to date haven’t triggered absolute chaos for consumers.",

    "content_text": "American police departments near the United States-Mexico border are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for an unproven and secretive technology that uses AI-generated online personas designed to interact with and collect intelligence on “college protesters,” “radicalized” political activists, and suspected drug and human traffickers, according to internal documents, contracts, and communications that 404 Media obtained via public records requests.\nMassive Blue, the New York–based company that is selling police departments this technology, calls its product Overwatch, which it markets as an “AI-powered force multiplier for public safety” that “deploys lifelike virtual agents, which infiltrate and engage criminal networks across various channels.” According to a presentation obtained by 404 Media, Massive Blue is offering cops these virtual personas that can be deployed across the internet with the express purpose of interacting with suspects over text messages and social media.\nMassive Blue lists “border security,” “school safety,” and stopping “human trafficking” among Overwatch’s use cases. The technology—which as of last summer had not led to any known arrests—demonstrates the types of social media monitoring and undercover tools private companies are pitching to police and border agents. Concerns about tools like Massive Blue have taken on new urgency considering that the Trump administration has revoked the visas of hundreds of students, many of whom have protested against Israel’s war in Gaza.\n404 Media obtained a presentation showing some of these AI characters. These include a “radicalized AI” “protest persona,” which poses as a 36-year-old divorced woman who is lonely, has no children, is interested in baking, activism, and “body positivity.” Another AI persona in the presentation is described as a “‘Honeypot’ AI Persona.” Her backstory says she’s a 25-year-old from Dearborn, Michigan, whose parents emigrated from Yemen and who speaks the Sanaani dialect of Arabic. The presentation also says she uses various social media apps, that she’s on Telegram and Signal, and that she has US and international SMS capabilities. Other personas are a 14-year-old boy “child trafficking AI persona,” an “AI pimp persona,” “college protestor,” “external recruiter for protests,” “escorts,” and “juveniles.”\nOur reporting shows that cops are paying a company to help them deploy AI-powered bots across social media and the internet to talk to people they suspect are anything from violent sex criminals all the way to vaguely defined “protestors” with the hopes of generating evidence that can be used against them.\n“This idea of having an AI pretending to be somebody, a youth looking for pedophiles to talk online, or somebody who is a fake terrorist, is an idea that goes back a long time,” Dave Maass, who studies border surveillance technologies for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told 404 Media. “The problem with all these things is that these are ill-defined problems. What problem are they actually trying to solve? One version of the AI persona is an escort. I’m not concerned about escorts. I’m not concerned about college protesters. So like, what is it effective at, violating protesters’ First Amendment rights?”\nMassive Blue has signed a $360,000 contract with Pinal County, Arizona, which is between Tucson and Phoenix. The county is paying for the contract with an anti-human trafficking grant from the Arizona Department of Public Safety. A Pinal County purchasing division report states that it has bought “24/7 monitoring of numerous web and social media platforms” and “development, deployment, monitoring, and reporting on a virtual task force of up to 50 AI personas across 3 investigative categories.” Yuma County, in southwestern Arizona, meanwhile, signed a $10,000 contract to try Massive Blue in 2023 but did not renew the contract. A spokesperson for the Yuma County Sheriff’s Office told 404 Media “it did not meet our needs.”\nMassive Blue cofounder Mike McGraw did not answer a series of specific questions from 404 Media about how Massive Blue works, what police departments it works with, and whether it had been used to generate any arrests. “We are proud of the work we do to support the investigation and prosecution of human traffickers,” McGraw said. “Our primary goal is to help bring these criminals to justice while helping victims who otherwise would remain trafficked. We cannot risk jeopardizing these investigations and putting victims’ lives in further danger by disclosing proprietary information.”\nThe Pinal County Sheriff’s Office told 404 Media that Massive Blue has not thus far been used for any arrests.\n“Our investigations are still underway. Massive Blue is one component of support in these investigations, which are still active and ongoing. No arrests have been made yet,” Sam Salzwedel, Pinal County Sheriff's Office public information officer, told 404 Media. “It takes a multifaceted approach to disrupting human traffickers, narcotics traffickers, and other criminals. Massive Blue has been a valuable partner in these initiatives and has produced leads that detectives are actively pursuing. Given these are ongoing investigations, we cannot risk compromising our investigative efforts by providing specifics about any personas.”\nSalzwedel added, “Massive Blue is not working on any immigration cases. Our agency does not enforce immigration law. Massive Blue’s support is focused on the areas of human trafficking, narcotics trafficking, and other investigations.”\nLaw enforcement agencies have taken steps to prevent specifics about what Massive Blue is and how it works from becoming public. At public appropriations hearings in Pinal County about the Massive Blue contract, the sheriff’s office refused to tell county council members about what the product even is. Matthew Thomas, Pinal County Deputy Sheriff, told the county council he “can’t get into great detail” about what Massive Blue is and that doing so would “tip our hand to the bad guys.”\nThe Arizona Department of Public Safety said, “From what we can ascertain, Pinal County planned to implement technology to help identify and solve human trafficking cases, and that is what we funded,” but was unaware of any of the specifics of Overwatch.\nWhile the documents don’t describe every technical aspect of how Overwatch works, they do give a high-level overview of what it is. The company describes a tool that uses AI-generated images and text to create social media profiles that can interact with suspected drug traffickers, human traffickers, and gun traffickers. After Overwatch scans open social media channels for potential suspects, these AI personas can also communicate with suspects over text, Discord, and other messaging services. The documents we obtained don’t explain how Massive Blue determines who is a potential suspect based on their social media activity. Salzwedel, of Pinal County, said “Massive Blue’s solutions crawl multiple areas of the Internet, and social media outlets are just one component. We cannot disclose any further information to preserve the integrity of our investigations.”\nOne slide in the Massive Blue presentation obtained by 404 Media gives the example of a “Child Trafficking AI Persona” called Jason. The presentation gives a short “backstory” for the persona, which says Jason is a 14-year-old boy from Los Angeles whose parents emigrated from Ecuador. He’s bilingual and an only child, and his hobbies include anime and gaming. The presentation describes his personality as shy and that he has difficulty interacting with girls. It also says that his parents don’t allow him to use social media and that he hides his use of Discord from them. This AI persona is also accompanied by an AI-generated image of a boy.\nThe presentation includes a conversation between this AI persona and what appears to be a predatory adult over text messages and Discord.\n“Your parents around? Or you getting some awesome alone time,” a text from the adult says.\n“Js chillin by myself, man. My momz @ work n my dadz outta town. So itz jus me n my vid games. 🎮,” Jason, the AI-generated child, responds.\nIn another example of how the “highly adaptable personas” can communicate with real people, the presentation shows a conversation between Clip, an “AI pimp persona,” and what appears to be a sex worker.\n“Dem tricks trippin 2nite tryin not pay,” the sex worker says.\n“Facts, baby. Ain’t lettin’ these tricks slide,” the Clip persona replies. “You stand your ground and make ’em pay what they owe. Daddy got your back, ain’t let nobody disrespect our grind. Keep hustlin’, ma, we gonna secure that bag💰💪✨”\n“The continuous evolution of operational, communication & recruitment tactics by bad actors drives exponential increases of threats and significant challenges in reducing demand,” says a one-page brochure provided to police departments that explains Overwatch’s functionality. “The Overwatch platform harnesses the power of AI & blockchain to scale your impact without operational or technical overhead.”\nJorge Brignoni took notes for the Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff’s Office at a meeting with Massive Blue in August 2023, which 404 Media obtained. In the notes, he wrote that Overwatch does “passive engagement, then active engagement, towards commitment” with a “Bad Actor, Predator, DTO,” or drug trafficking organization. These targets are then “HAND[ed] OFF to L.E. [law enforcement] to arrest, indict, convict.”\n“Why is he talking about converting folks into ‘buying something,’” Brignoni wrote. “So dumb. Talk about the widget, not how you’re selling the widget to L.E.”\nAccording to Brignoni’s notes, in addition to collecting intelligence via these AI personas, Overwatch also leverages “Telco & Geo Data” and “Blockchain Data” in the form of “full transaction history, top associated wallet IDs, sending & receiving cryptocurrency, potential off-ramps (Exchange names).” The Cochise County Sheriff’s Office ultimately did not buy Massive Blue and did not provide answers to 404 Media’s questions about its meeting with the company.\nBesides scanning social media and engaging suspects with AI personas, the presentation says that Overwatch can use generative AI to create “proof of life” images of a person holding a sign with a username and date written on it in pen.\nThe Massive Blue presentation gives an example of an “Overwatch Recon Report” based on “24 hours of activity across Dallas, Houston, and Austin.” It claims that Overwatch identified 3,266 unique human traffickers, 25 percent of which were affiliated with “larger sophisticated trafficking organizations” and 15 percent of which were flagged as “potential juvenile traffickers.” 404 Media was not able to verify what these accounts were and whether they actually engaged in any criminal activity, and Massive Blue didn’t respond to questions about what these accounts were and how exactly it identified them.\nOn top of the ongoing contract with the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office and the pilot with the Yuma County Sheriff’s Department last year, Massive Blue has pitched its services to Cochise County in Arizona and the Texas Department of Public Safety, according to documents obtained as part of this investigation.\nIn September 2023, Yuma County set up a meeting that was going to include federal law enforcement, but Massive Blue had to cancel the meeting: “That’s unfortunate, we had federal agents here that focus on human trafficking ready to go,” a Yuma County sergeant wrote in an email to Massive Blue CEO Brian Haley after Haley canceled the meeting.\nMuch of Massive Blue’s public-facing activity has been through its executive director of public safety, Chris Clem, who is a former US Customs and Border Protection agent who testified before Congress about border security last year and regularly appears on Fox News and other media outlets to discuss immigration and the border. In recent months, Clem has posted images of himself on LinkedIn at the border and with prominent Trump administration members Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Massive Blue has also relied on former Kansas City Chiefs kicker Nick Lowery to introduce and endorse Overwatch to police departments.\nClem and Lowery have spoken most extensively publicly about Overwatch, where they have described it as an amorphous “cyberwall” that can do everything from stopping human traffickers to preventing hackers from breaking into 401(k) accounts to taking money back from hackers who have stolen from you, though they provide no specifics about how that would work.\nIn a two-and-a-half-hour interview with podcaster Theo Von, Clem said, “My company Massive Blue, we basically use deep tech to identify the habits and process of you know, look, I worked on a physical wall, now we’ve created a cyberwall,” adding that he believed it would “save lives.”\nVon asked, “OK, but how does your company do that?”\n“Well, I’m not going to get into that too much,” Clem responded, adding that he is trying to sell the technology to US Border Patrol.\nOn June 5, a Pinal County Board of Supervisors meeting was asked to approve a $500,000 contract between the county and Massive Blue in order to license Overwatch.\n“I was looking at the website for Massive Blue, and it’s a one-pager with no additional information and no links,” Kevin Cavanaugh, the then-supervisor for District 1, said to Pinal County’s Chief Deputy at the Sheriff’s Office, Matthew Thomas. “They produce software that we buy, and it does what? Can you explain that to us?”\n“I can’t get into great detail because it’s essentially trade secrets, and I don’t want to tip our hand to the bad guys,” Thomas said. “But what I can tell you is that the software is designed to help our investigators look for and find and build a case on human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gun trafficking.”\nCavanaugh said at the board meeting that the basic information he got is that Massive Blue uses “50 AI bots.” He then asked whether the software has been successful and if it helped law enforcement make any arrests. Thomas explained they have not made any arrests yet because they’ve only seen the proof of concept, but that the proof of concept was “good enough for us and our investigators to move forward with this. Once this gets approved and we get them [Massive Blue] under contract, then we are going to move forward with prosecution of cases.”\nCavanaugh asked if Overwatch is used in other counties, which prompted Thomas to invite Clem to the podium to speak. Clem introduced himself as a recently retired border agent and said that Massive Blue is currently in negotiations with three counties in Arizona, including Pinal County.\n“As a resident of 14 years of Pinal County I know what’s happening here,” Clem said to the Board of Supervisors. “To be able [to] use this program [...] to provide all the necessary information to go after the online exploitation of children, trafficking victims, and all the other verticals that the sheriff may want to go after.”\nCavanaugh again asked if Massive Blue gathered any data that led to arrests.\n“We have not made arrests yet, but there is a current investigation right now regarding arson, and we got the leads to the investigators,” Clem said, explaining that the program has been active for only about six months. “Investigations take time, but we’ve been able to generate the necessary leads for the particular counties that we’re involved with and also in the private sector.”\nThe Pinal County Board of Supervisors concluded the exchange by approving payment for a handful of other, unrelated projects, but with board members asking to delay the vote on payment for Massive Blue “for further study.”\nThe decision not to fund Massive Blue that day was covered in a local newspaper. Cavanaugh told the paper that he asked the company to meet with supervisors to explain the merits of the software.\n“The State of Arizona has provided a grant, but grant money is taxpayer money. No matter the source of the funding, fighting human and sex trafficking is too important to risk half a million dollars on unproven technology,” he said. “If the company demonstrates that it can deliver evidence to arrest human traffickers, it may be worthwhile. However, it has yet to achieve this goal.”\n404 Media’s public record requests yielded several emails from Cavanaugh’s office to IT professionals and other companies that provide AI products to law enforcement, asking them if they’re familiar with Massive Blue. We don’t know what was said in those meetings, or if they occurred, but when the Pinal County Board of Supervisors convened again on June 19 it voted to pay for Massive Blue’s Overwatch without further discussion.\n“Supervisor [Cavanaugh] ultimately voted for the agreement because Massive Blue is alleged to be in pursuit of human trafficking, a noble goal,” a representative from Cavanaugh’s office told 404 Media in an email. “A major concern regarding the use of the application, is that the government should not be monitoring each and every citizen. To his knowledge, no arrests have been made to date as a result of the use of the application. If Overwatch is used to bring about arrests of human traffickers, then the program should continue. However, if it is just being used to collect surveillance on law-abiding citizens and is not leading to any arrests, then the program needs to be discontinued.”\nIn an August 7, 2024, Board of Supervisors meeting, Cavanaugh asked then-Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb for an update on Massive Blue. “So they have not produced any results? They’ve produced no leads? No evidence that is actionable?” Cavanaugh asked. “That would be public knowledge, that would be public information.”\n“I think there’s a lot of ongoing investigations that they’re not going to give you information on, and we’re not going to give you information on,” Lamb said.",

    "content_text": "As the United States grapples with rising measles cases and outbreaks in several states, another vaccine-preventable disease is quietly spreading throughout the country.\nThis year, there have been at least 7,599 cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, up from 3,473 cases at this time last year, according to the latest tally by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With a record number of parents seeking vaccine exemptions for their children and childhood vaccination rates declining, more outbreaks of measles, pertussis, and other diseases are not just likely, they’re inevitable.\n“When vaccination rates fall, the first disease you’re going to see show up is measles because it’s so contagious, but others will follow,” says Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Texas, the epicenter of the current measles outbreak, and a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “This is a troublesome trend.”\nLast year, there were 285 cases of measles for all of 2024. This year, cases have already risen to over 700, and two children have died of the disease. Children have also been dying of whooping cough. In Louisiana, two infants died of the disease in the past six months—the state’s first deaths from the illness since 2018—according to a recent statement by the state’s surgeon general. In January, South Dakota’s department of health announced that a child died due to a co-infection of flu and pertussis. And in February, a local health department in Washington confirmed that a Spokane County child under the age of 5 died of whooping cough—the first in the state since 2011.\nA type of bacterial infection, whooping cough is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It causes flu-like symptoms and violent, rapid coughing. It’s known for the characteristic, high-pitched “whoop” sound when someone inhales after a coughing fit. The disease is especially dangerous for babies because it can interfere with their breathing.\nNationwide, there were 35,435 cases of whooping cough in 2024, compared with 7,063 in 2023, according to a provisional surveillance report from the CDC. Cases hit a low of 2,116 in 2021 due to social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic and were still on the rebound in 2023. Yet 2024’s numbers far outpaced the 18,617 cases seen in 2019 and 15,609 cases in 2018.\nThe disease can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and death. Infants and young children are particularly at risk. Around a third of infants under six months old who came down with whooping cough in 2024 required hospitalization.\n“The crux of the disease is that it’s caused by this particular bacteria, Bordetella pertussis, which creates a toxin, and that toxin can be very damaging to our lungs,” says Amy Edwards, associate professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.\nVaccination is the best way to protect against infection and severe disease. The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, or DTaP, vaccine is given in five doses in infancy and early childhood. Immunity from vaccination and natural infection eventually wanes, and a booster shot is recommended at age 11 or 12 and every 10 years after, including for adults. The CDC advises pregnant people to get a booster during each pregnancy.\nFewer children getting vaccinated also affects adults, who are less likely to be up-to-date on their recommended vaccinations. “Because a lot of adults don’t get boosted, pertussis is going to be one of the earliest vaccine-preventable illnesses that we see in that population,” Edwards says. “Other vaccine-preventable illnesses will follow if we don’t get ahead of it and vaccinate our children.”\nFor pertussis and measles, high rates of vaccination within communities are needed to make sure everyone is protected from infection and severe disease—some people can’t take vaccines for medical reasons, or may have weakened immune systems, and so rely on the collective immunity of everyone else to avoid getting these infections. For measles, 95 percent vaccine coverage is needed for community protection. For pertussis, it’s 92 to 94 percent. In many places in the US, vaccination rates have been steadily declining.\nThe pandemic disrupted many routine health care services, leading to a dip in childhood vaccination rates, and those rates have yet to recover. Confidence in childhood vaccination has plummeted among Republicans, a spillover effect from growing distrust in science as a result of Covid vaccine mandates and rapidly evolving health guidance during the pandemic. More parents are now opting out of vaccinating their children for religious and philosophical reasons.\nAfter a decade of nearly 95 percent of children nationwide receiving all four of the major childhood vaccines—MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), DTaP, poliovirus, and chickenpox—coverage declined to 93 percent from 2019 to 2023. It fell again, to below 93 percent, during the 2023 to 2024 school year, while the number of exemptions from one or more vaccines among kindergartners grew.\nPublic health experts worry that childhood vaccination rates could dip further under the current Trump administration with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the helm of the US Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC. Kennedy has long promoted the discredited claim that vaccines cause autism and other anti-vaccine myths. Amid rising measles cases—the highest in the US since 2019—Kennedy has downplayed the threat of the disease.\n“We’re certainly seeing an increase in the momentum towards the idea of medical freedom or personal choice, and we’ve heard that messaging reiterated by our current administration,” says Crystal Rommen, director of Louisiana Families for Vaccines, a nonprofit that provides evidence-based information to educate families about the impact of vaccines. “One message that we’re really trying to emphasize to the parents and the other community members across the state is that the MMR vaccine is safe. It’s effective,” she says.\nChickenpox is one disease that could come back as a result of declining vaccination rates. Before a vaccine was introduced in 1995, more than 4 million people got chickenpox each year, hospitalizations numbered more than 10,000, and as many as 150 people died, half of them children, according to the CDC.\nDiphtheria and tetanus—the other diseases the DTaP vaccine protects against—could be next. While diphtheria has essentially been eradicated in the US, there have been recent cases in Europe. Other vaccine-preventable diseases, such as pneumococcal disease and Haemophilus influenzae type b, or Hib disease, could also rebound.\nThere’s a risk of polio reemergence, too. The US eradicated polio in 1979, and the rest of the world is on the brink of doing so, but USAID cuts by the Trump administration that provide funding for polio vaccination could put that status in jeopardy. If polio cases flare up outside of the US, falling vaccine coverage inside of the country could then leave children vulnerable. “It depends on how low the vaccination rates get,” Edwards says. “If people see these outbreaks as a wake-up call and vaccine uptake increases, we really could dodge the rest. But I don’t hold out hope for that.”",

It causes flu-like symptoms and violent, rapid coughing. It’s known for the characteristic, high-pitched “whoop” sound when someone inhales after a coughing fit. The disease is especially dangerous for babies because it can interfere with their breathing.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Nationwide, there were 35,435 cases of whooping cough in 2024, compared with 7,063 in 2023, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">provisional surveillance report</a> from the CDC. Cases hit a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">low of 2,116 in 2021</a> due to social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic and were still on the rebound in 2023. Yet 2024’s numbers far outpaced the 18,617 cases seen in 2019 and 15,609 cases in 2018.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The disease can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and death. Infants and young children are particularly at risk. Around a third of infants under six months old who came down with whooping cough in 2024 required hospitalization.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“The crux of the disease is that it’s caused by this particular bacteria, <em>Bordetella pertussis</em>, which creates a toxin, and that toxin can be very damaging to our lungs,” says Amy Edwards, associate professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Vaccination is the best way to protect against infection and severe disease. The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, or DTaP, vaccine is given in five doses in infancy and early childhood. Immunity from vaccination and natural infection eventually wanes, and a booster shot is recommended at age 11 or 12 and every 10 years after, including for adults. The CDC advises pregnant people to get a booster during each pregnancy.</p></div></div></body></html>",

What’s the easiest tool for me to learn, and should I be worried? —Lifelong Learner\nBe not afraid! I promise that you do not need to learn how to use a generative AI tool like ChatGPT or Claude to ensure your grandkids see you as a relevant, informed person. If anything, I would say that our culture has tipped over the past year to generally oppose the use of generative AI tools due to their outsize environmental impact, ethical concerns over their data scraping, and general sludginess of the outputs. So, depending on your relatives' worldview, confessing that you don’t use any chatbot tools might even boost your cool factor with them.\nAlso, AI chatbots are possibly eroding our social skills. OpenAI recently conducted a research study to determine whether repetitive ChatGPT usage made users feel lonelier and less social overall. It did; the most frequent ChatGPT users in the study became emotionally dependent on the chatbot's company. So, if you want to spend time fostering better connections with your family, generative AI should be near the bottom of your list of essential tools to learn.\nInstead, stay up to speed on your basic software-enabled communication skills like texting, emailing, video calling, and the proper uses of social media. Keeping these skills sharp may help you feel more connected online, both through direct communication with your family members and your more complete awareness of what the grandkids are doing day to day.\nIf you want to experiment with AI tools, I'd recommend using them with your family members for education and entertainment. When ChatGPT first came out in 2022 and I was visiting my parents for the holidays, we had a wonderful time trying it out together, making funny poems, and refining prompts just to see what the AI could do. If your grandkids are really into using this type of software, then asking if they could spend 30 minutes the next time you're together in person playing around with the tool could be an enjoyable bonding experience.\nIf you're not the fastest typer, you may find the voice options for inputting prompts into the chatbot more comfortable to use. ChatGPT’s voice mode is entertaining to chat with, though it will likely feel quite odd at first. I mean, how do you strike up a conversation with a piece of software? But once you get used to voice mode, it can be fun to ask it to teach you phrases in different languages. Before traveling to Japan last year, I spent hours and hours practicing speaking Japanese with ChatGPT. It’s not a perfect tutor, but I found the process to be quite enjoyable.\nOne thing to keep in mind is that chatbots often fabricate information or spit out search results that contain inaccuracies. This can happen when you're doing web searches to gather specific information, or when you ask the chatbot a general question. The wrong answers given by these generative AI tools can sound quite confident, so you're better off doing some additional digging to verify what it told you. When you're doing this double-checking, you may realize there’s not much you can get from ChatGPT today that you couldn’t find through a simple Google search.\nAnother detail worth remembering: It’s not alive. Even if you feel impressed with the quality of the answers or get an uncanny feeling that it’s more than just a software program talking to you, remind yourself that chatbots are massive tools that memorize the patterns of human writing and interactions with the intention of mimicking them. The mimicry may be stunning, but the expressions are ultimately hollow.\nLet's get back to your worries about staying connected to family. Take a moment and genuinely think about your relationship with your grandkids. They hopefully love you for who you are, and what kind of software you use or avoid shouldn’t have any impact on that. I feel like life is far too short to be caught up in our anxieties about how others view us. As soon as you finish this article, give them a call (or send them an Instagram DM) and tell them how you feel as well as how important family is to you. Do it now. I promise it’s worth it.

    "content_text": "The Global Engagement Center, a State Department unit that called out Russian and Chinese propaganda campaigns and became a MAGA boogeyman, has been shut down. Team Trump is promising that it’s just the start of an examination of alleged censorship during the Biden administration—and the first Trump administration too.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio called the move “a crucial step toward keeping the president’s promise to liberate American speech” in an op-ed for the right-wing site The Federalist. Critics say it’s part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to withdraw from a decades-long contest of ideas and information with America’s adversaries.\nIn early February, Attorney General Pam Bondi disbanded the Justice Department task force on covert foreign influence and radically narrowed enforcement of the law that outlawed secretive propaganda for overseas regimes. The Trump administration gutted the parent organization of the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Free Asia, which aimed to provide news and demonstrate the value of a free press in regions of the world where both were often in short supply. Together, according to The Washington Post, they reached a weekly audience of 420 million people in 63 languages. “Most shameful moment at the department since the purges of the 1950s,” one State Department official, who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the press, tells WIRED.\nTo Trumpists, the push to publish American-style news around the world was an outdated waste of taxpayer money, and attempts to combat disinformation abroad, even if their origins were benign, were really attempts to silence right-wing Americans. The Global Engagement Center, or GEC, became a particular fixation. “The worst offender in US government censorship & media manipulation is an obscure agency called GEC,” Elon Musk posted in 2023. (MIT Technology Review first reported the news of its closure.)\n(“The allegations of ‘censorship’ against the GEC are as fictitious as the conspiracy theories spun by various bad-faith actors around international broadcasting and other long-standing institutions of American soft power now under attack,” said the State Department official.)\nFirst established during the war on terror to counter and keep tabs on militant messaging overseas, the GEC expanded over the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations into a $60-million, 120-person shop which also tracked and exposed rival nation-state campaigns to spread propaganda and pollute the information environment. It mapped a multibillion-dollar Chinese influence program that stretched from Pakistan to Latin America. It looked into the social media accounts boosting Germany’s far-right AfD party and spreading neo-Nazi propaganda. It revealed a covert Russian effort to undermine public health in Africa. And the GEC called out the Kremlin’s claims that the “United States worked with Ukraine to train an army of migratory birds, mosquitos, and even bats to carry biological weapons into Russia.”\nSometimes, with grants of just a few thousand dollars, it funded the work of journalists in countries targeted by the Putin regime. “We were really focused on building the capacity of folks that were already doing that good work and making sure that they had the platform to continue to tell their stories—to tell the truth in an environment that was trying to take that from them,” a second State Department source tells WIRED.\nOver the years, the GEC’s effectiveness and execution were questioned by the State Department’s Inspector General, among others. But the GEC and efforts like it generally received bipartisan support. That started to change after the pandemic—and Musk’s purchase of Twitter. The so-called “Twitter Files”—reports based on Musk’s release of internal company emails—seemed to show the GEC being far too aggressive in its attempts to tamp down on alleged Covid disinformation during Trump’s first term. Republican critics like US Representative Brian Mast of Florida complained that the GEC wasn’t being aggressive enough in support of Israel after October 7. Other GOP congresspersons zeroed in on its $100,000 grant to the UK-based Global Disinformation Index to monitor media in Asia. The Index later compiled a list of the 10 American news outlets at highest risk of publishing false claims; nearly all of them were MAGA-friendly. This was an entirely separate project from the one the GEC funded, but Trumpists saw the existence of the list as evidence that it was suppressing speech at home when it was supposed to be looking abroad.\n“GEC’s history shows the pernicious way Washington turns laudable public goals into a means of entrenching its own power and rolling back the freedom of regular Americans,” Rubio wrote in his op-ed. “Over the past half-decade, bodies like GEC, crafted by our own governing ruling class, nearly destroyed America’s long free speech history. The enemies of speech had new lingo to justify their authoritarian impulse. It was ‘disinformation,’ allegedly pushed by nefarious foreign governments, that was the No. 1 threat to ‘our democracy.’ To protect ‘our democracy,’ this ‘disinformation’ had to be identified and stamped out.”\nA famously conservative US court of appeals rejected this idea, writing that “there is no indication that State Department officials flagged specific content for censorship.” But by then, the GEC was poison in MAGA minds. Its participation in a State Department campaign accusing Kremlin-funded media outlet RT of being an intelligence operation did not change their opinions. The GEC was cleared of “having anything to do with domestic suppression of points of view. But what was going on was that they decided that this was a winnable, small victory they could have over this ‘liberal institution,’” according to a diplomatic source with direct knowledge of the matter.\nA December deal to reauthorize funding for the GEC, due to run out in 2024, fell apart after “Elon Musk got involved,” that source said; the center was officially disbanded, but about 50 staffers and $30 million in funding were moved to a “Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Hub” in the hopes of proving the value of such an operation to their new MAGA superiors. They were also given a new boss, Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy Darren Beattie.\nThe name may sound familiar. Beattie had left a trail of trolly posts on Musk’s social media platform—promoting the Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, for instance, and musing that “competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work.” He also called his future boss Marco Rubio “low IQ.”\nRubio, until recently, was hawkish about fighting foreign influence campaigns. In 2023, a second diplomatic source with direct knowledge said, he supported reauthorizing funding the GEC into the 2030s. “It’s not just Russia—Iran, China, North Korea, and even Cuba are pushing disinformation into America,” he posted last September. But after being confirmed as secretary of state, Rubio appeared to do something of a 180. While the department would continue to counter “enemy propaganda,” he wrote in a cable, any State Department programs that “lead or in any way open the door to censorship of the American people will be terminated.”\n“The secretary believes shutting down GEC was long overdue,” a State spokesperson tells WIRED. “It cost taxpayers $50 million a year, and the Biden administration used that money to silence and censor Americans. What started out years ago as an effort to counter terrorist organizations was exploited by partisan bureaucrats who used the office to go after Americans’ free speech. Even career employees acknowledged GEC’s ambiguous mission was always problematic. Thanks to Secretary Rubio, the American people won’t have to worry about it anymore, as it has been permanently disbanded.”\nFor the first 60 days, the renamed, pared-down Global Engagement Center escaped the clear-cutting that took down the US Agency for International Development and other programs boosting America’s standing abroad. But employees there knew that this was, at best, a temporary stay of execution. In his Federalist op-ed, Rubio wrote, “Today, we are putting that to an end. Whatever name it goes by, GEC is dead. It will not return.”\nStories about GEC will continue, Rubio promised in a livestreamed conversation with Mike Benz, a former State Department official who has both a well-documented animus toward foreign-assistance and counter-disinformation programs—as well as a long history of promoting outlandish conspiracy theories.\nBenz asked Rubio if there would be a kind of Twitter Files sequel, this time for GEC. “Yeah. So I think what we have to do now, and Darren [Beattie] will be involved in that as well, is sort of document what happened,” Rubio answered.\nThe secretary of state promised an even further-reaching, “cross-jurisdictional” effort to look at who got “deplatformed” for peddling disinformation or foreign propaganda and whether the US government could be blamed for it. “If we could somehow, with an internal review, create a linkage between some information that came from something the State Department paid for and an actual aggrieved party, that's what's important,” Rubio said.",

    "content_text": "AmeriCorps, the US federal agency that oversees volunteerism and service work, abruptly pulled teams of young people out of a variety of community service projects across the country on Tuesday. The work stoppage was due to cuts attributed to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, volunteers were informed Tuesday afternoon.\nWIRED spoke with seven workers with the National Civilian Community Corps, better known as AmeriCorps NCCC, who say that they were told to stop working on projects ranging from rebuilding homes destroyed in storms, to readying a summer camp for kids, to distributing supplies for hurricane recovery, and prepare to immediately travel back to their homes.\nAadharsh Jeyasakthivel, a 23-year-old from Boston, was serving at a county food bank in rural Pennsylvania when he and his fellow volunteers were suddenly pulled from service.\n“Non Americorps ppl are still distributing,” he wrote to WIRED in a Signal message, sending a photo of yellow-vested volunteers working on a line in a parking lot.\nThe AmeriCorps NCCC program was established under the Clinton administration by the National and Community Service Trust Act, signed in 1993. Each year, it recruits 2,200 people between the ages of 18 to 26 to serve in teams working across the country on different projects. Some volunteers also work directly alongside staff from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Forest Service, as part of smaller programs that are run within the NCCC. Graduates of the program get access to an award to help pay off federal student loans.\n“In alignment with the Trump-Vance Administration priorities and Executive Order 14222, ‘Implementing the President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Cost Efficiency Initiative,’ AmeriCorps NCCC is working within new operational parameters that impact the program’s ability to sustain program operations,” reads an email sent April 15 to NCCC volunteers seen by WIRED. A separate memo, also seen by WIRED, sent to workers signed by NCCC national director Ken Goodson, releases volunteers from the program and informs them that their benefits will be discontinued April 30. Volunteers’ “early departure,” that memo states, “results from program circumstances beyond your control.” (Workers who had completed at least 15 percent of the program, the first email notes, would be eligible for a prorated education award.)\nAmeriCorps did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn early April, an AmeriCorps representative told Politico Playbook that DOGE staff “are currently working at AmeriCorps headquarters and the agency is supporting their requests.” A day later, The Washington Post reported that the agency was considering a 50 percent cut to its budget. In 2024, the NCCC program made up $37.7 million of the agency’s $1.2 billion budget.\nThe volunteer cuts, which included young people who told WIRED they were tasked with making forests more resilient to wildfires and helping out FEMA staff at the agency’s headquarters, come just weeks before the official start of hurricane season.\n“NCCC and FEMA Corps represent a critical flexible workforce that is able to support disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery efforts across the country,” says Samantha Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at Massachusetts Maritime Academy. “The loss of the people who make up these programs will be felt immediately, and especially in the next major disaster.”\nAmeriCorps and the NCCC program have come under scrutiny in past years. Last year, the Government Accountability Office found that AmeriCorps needed to take more steps to prevent fraud in its grantmaking, while a 2017 Office of Inspector General report found that the NCCC program, which provides volunteers room and board, clothing, and any specialized training they might need, was four to eight times more expensive than other AmeriCorps programs.\nVolunteers who spoke to WIRED said they and their team members had gotten job training in a variety of disciplines during their deployment, from data management to forklift operation to wildland firefighting certification.\n“These programs are an important pathway for young people looking to have careers in emergency management and disaster work more broadly, so impacts will be felt in that way too,” Montano says.\nAmeriCorps has historically been a target for some right-wing media figures and organizations, including Glenn Beck, Michelle Malkin, and the Heritage Foundation. The first Trump administration’s 2017 budget proposal attempted to slash funding for the agency altogether.\nThe long-term fate of the NCCC program is not immediately clear. An informational page on applying to the Fall 2025 cohort is still active on the AmeriCorps website, but a separate application portal lists no positions accepting applications.\nFor volunteers unexpectedly traveling home on Thursday, the loss cuts deep.\n“I understand that the [Trump administration] has been cutting and gutting so many important programs, but I want people to know about what they did to Americorps. For many of us, this was our way to pay for college, to get away from home, to figure out what to do with our lives, it was a big step,” says 19-year-old Coloradan Noe Felix Burns, who was rebuilding houses in Philadelphia damaged by 2021’s Hurricane Ida. “And they just ripped it out from under us without even a two-week’s notice.”",

Managed by the nonprofit research-and-development group MITRE, the CVE Program is a linchpin of global cybersecurity—providing critical data and services for digital defense and research.\nThe CVE Program is governed by a board that sets an agenda and priorities for MITRE to carry out using CISA's funding. A CISA spokesperson said on Wednesday that the contract with MITRE is being extended for 11 months. “The CVE Program is invaluable to the cyber community and a priority of CISA,” they said in a statement. “Last night, CISA executed the option period on the contract to ensure there will be no lapse in critical CVE services. We appreciate our partners’ and stakeholders’ patience.”\nMITRE's vice president and director of the Center for Securing the Homeland, Yosry Barsoum, said in a statement on Wednesday that “CISA identified incremental funding to keep the Programs operational.” With the clock ticking down before this decision came out, though, some members of the CVE Program's board announced a plan to transition the project into a new nonprofit entity called the CVE Foundation.\n“Since its inception, the CVE Program has operated as a US government-funded initiative, with oversight and management provided under contract. While this structure has supported the program’s growth, it has also raised long-standing concerns among members of the CVE Board about the sustainability and neutrality of a globally relied-upon resource being tied to a single government sponsor,” the Foundation wrote in a statement. “This concern has become urgent following an April 15, 2025, letter from MITRE notifying the CVE Board that the US government does not intend to renew its contract for managing the program. While we had hoped this day would not come, we have been preparing for this possibility.”\nIt is unclear who from the current CVE board is affiliated with the new initiative other than Kent Landfield, a longtime cybersecurity industry member who was quoted in the CVE Foundation statement. The CVE Foundation did not immediately return a request for comment.\nCISA did not respond to questions from WIRED about why the fate of the CVE Program contract had been in question and whether it was related to recent budget cuts sweeping the federal government as mandated by the Trump administration.\nResearchers and cybersecurity professionals were relieved on Wednesday that the CVE Program hadn't suddenly ceased to exist as the result of unprecedented instability in US federal funding. And many observers expressed cautious optimism that the incident could ultimately make the CVE Program more resilient if it transitions to be an independent entity that isn't reliant on funding from any one government or other single source.\n“The CVE Program is critical, and it’s in everyone’s interest that it succeed,\" says Patrick Garrity, a security researcher at VulnCheck. “Nearly every organization and every security tool is dependent on this information, and it’s not just the US. It’s consumed globally. So it's really, really important that it continues to be a community-provided service, and we need to figure out what to do about this, because losing it would be a risk to everyone.”\nFederal procurement records indicate that it costs in the tens of millions of dollars per contract to run the CVE Program. But in the scheme of the losses that can occur from a single cyberattack exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities, experts tell WIRED, the operational costs seem negligible versus the benefit to US defense alone.\nDespite CISA's last-minute funding, the future of the CVE Program is still unclear for the long term.

    "content_text": "As the chaotic rollout of President Donald Trump’s tariffs last week rattled the nerves of companies across nearly every industry in America and around the globe, one small business owner in the San Francisco Bay Area was trying to figure out if he could finagle his way through a loophole.\nEric Mueller, of the punk rock record label and vinyl importer Pirates Press. was wondering whether he could classify his company's records—which include colored vinyl releases by bands like Rancid, the Slackers, and Cock Sparrer—as “informational material.” Doing so would allow the records to be imported from overseas pressing plants without incurring a tariff under a little-known law.\nMore than anything Mueller is hoping to find peace of mind. “The volatility is insane,” he says. “We had a couple dozen shipments leave in the past few days, and we’re trying to figure out what we're supposed to bill people!”\nThe Trump administration’s erratic on-again, off-again approach to tariffs is seeding general confusion throughout the record industry. Manufacturers and brokers, mom-and-pop and otherwise, are aligned in recognizing that any additional costs incurred by tariffs will ultimately be passed onto consumers. Even a 10 percent increase incurred by Trump’s (as of this moment) revised, across-the-board tariffs could make a significant dent in an industry already negatively impacted by inflation and rising costs. Recent industry estimates suggest that the proposed tariffs could jack up costs by 24 percent and could lead to more production being offshored. Mueller estimates that a new vinyl record may retail for $30 to $40, up from $15 to $25 just a few years ago.\n“Look at the math: Peoples’ incomes haven’t gone up by that much,” he says. “The industry is definitely receding. Factories are struggling. If the cost of records goes up, it’s not a good thing. It’s not going to help anybody.”\nBut the industry’s potential, label-saving exception comes from the Berman Amendment, which provides exemptions to “informational materials” like books, films, tapes, CDs, and other media containing material protected under the First Amendment, regardless of their country of origin. Passed by Congress in 1988 and authored by Democratic Representative Howard Berman, the amendment was one of the earliest obstructions in lawmakers’ attempts to ban TikTok, with a Washington Post headline calling it “an obscure hurdle.”\n“What this exemption does,” Mueller explains, “is make sure there’s still a free flow of information.”\nA representative of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade organization representing the US music industry, tentatively confirms that the “current understanding” is that imports of records are excluded from Trump’s tariffs.\nFor the record industry, that’s good news. Despite the uptick in homegrown manufacturing over the past decade, which has followed from the resurgent popularity of vinyl records themselves, a great many of the albums stocking shelves of record stores are manufactured abroad. Czech-based conglomerate GZ Media is the largest record presser in the world, churning out about 70 million records a year. Under the current Berman Amendment carve-outs, all of those records could be imported Stateside without being impacted by massive tariffs. But that doesn’t mean the US vinyl industry is out of the woods. (A spokesperson for GZ declined to speak to WIRED, saying that the company has “decided not to comment on topics related to politics or tariffs.”)\n“There’s no tariff paid on importing a completed record, but there are tariffs paid bringing in the materials,” explains Michael Greig Thomas, director of the Athens, Georgia, vinyl manufacturer Echo Base. Actual, US-based vinyl companies stand to face hefty increases, importing raw materials essential to the manufacturing process: paper products from Canada, aluminum discs used in stamping the records (called lacquers) from Japan, and so on. Most essential of all, of course, is the actual vinyl.\nThe bulk of record manufacturers, in the US and elsewhere, source polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from Thailand. Petrochemical companies like NeoTech Composite and the Plastic and Chemicals Public Company (a subsidiary of the Siam Cement Group Corporation) supply the overwhelming majority. The Trump administration had originally threatened Thailand with a substantial 36 percent tariff, which would naturally raise costs for US manufacturers.\nCertain specialized industrial equipment used in the processes (boilers that heat the PVC pellets, chillers to control temperature) also tend to be manufactured and serviced from abroad. Steven Walker, owner of mom-and-pop manufacturer 33 Grooves Records, is worried that repairs could soon become exceedingly costly. “Everything is Asian or European,” he says. “My machines were made in Hong Kong. And if I have to get any parts sourced from China, it’s pretty scary.” (As of this writing, Chinese imports have been hit with a whopping 125 percent import tariff.)\nThere’s an absurd irony here, which is perhaps not all that shocking given the overwhelming erraticism of Trump’s economic schemes. Because the import and export of vinyl records is exempted from tariffs, US brokers can still get their product pressed abroad in Central Europe and shipped back Stateside, with little in the way of additional cost beyond the usual duties. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar US-based manufacturers face potential increases in their bottom line, as they have little option but to import their raw materials from across the globe. “It’s a consistent problem that has stifled the vinyl record-pressing industry in the US,” says Echo Base’s Thomas. “The bigger companies are kind of like an oligarchy, and most of those companies are external to the US.”\nAnother major problem is advocacy. So far, the Trump administration’s approach to tariffs has benefited bigger businesses. The White House seemingly plucks a number out of the air, and then representatives from across different industries line up to wheedle the number down. Vinyl record manufacturing is a billion-dollar business, supporting over 1,500 jobs nationwide. But it is still, as Thomas put it, something of a “cottage industry.” It certainly doesn’t necessarily have the kind of presidential pull enjoyed by tech companies and banks. “There are some industries that are going to be better represented by lobbies,” Thomas says. “There’s a really big concern that our voices are not going to be heard. Not everyone knows the most expedient way to speak to their local representative and get things moving up the chain.”\nThe looming threat of a broader economic recession also figures into industry-wide anxieties threatening not just record manufacturers and retailers but trickling down to labels and artists.\n“It’s only going to hurt the industry in the grand scheme of things,” Mueller says. “The alternative to buying a record is not paying to support artists and just continuing to stream records, where the artists earn a fraction of the cost.”\nBeyond increasing prices, both for manufacturers and the end-consumer crate digging at their local record shop, the feeling of economic uneasiness can breed hostility.\nDave Eck, who runs Waxy Poodle Record in Wisconsin, says Trump’s spiked trade rhetoric has impacted his relationships as much as the actual policies. Eck conducts a lot of business in Canada, which the president has decried as “nasty” and repeatedly threatened to annex as America’s 51st state. It’s a tense situation, which has fostered anti-American sentiment north of the border. Where a “Made in USA” label on a record was once a mark of quality, now it suggests something different. “All my vendors up there don’t like me anymore, because I’m American,” Eck says. “I’m having a harder time getting my product turned around, because the whole feeling in Canada right now is not to support us.”\nOf course there are, at some stops in the supply chain, a few Trump loyalists. Eck recalls a cardboard box salesman who recently encouraged him to bone up on some of Donald Trump’s negotiating tactics. He laughs: “He said I’ll understand better if I read The Art of the Deal!”",

Manufacturers and brokers, mom-and-pop and otherwise, are aligned in recognizing that any additional costs incurred by tariffs will ultimately be passed onto consumers. Even a 10 percent increase incurred by Trump’s (as of this moment) revised, across-the-board tariffs could make a significant dent in an industry already negatively impacted by inflation and rising costs. Recent industry estimates suggest that the proposed tariffs could jack up costs by 24 percent and could lead to more production being offshored. Mueller estimates that a new vinyl record may retail for $30 to $40, up from $15 to $25 just a few years ago.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">“Look at the math: Peoples’ incomes haven’t gone up by that much,” he says. “The industry is definitely receding. Factories are struggling. If the cost of records goes up, it’s not a good thing. It’s not going to help anybody.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">But the industry’s potential, label-saving exception comes from the <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://sanctions.org/turbofac/research/OFAC-exemptions-ieepa-Legislative-History-Berman-Amendment\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://sanctions.org/turbofac/research/OFAC-exemptions-ieepa-Legislative-History-Berman-Amendment\" href=\"https://sanctions.org/turbofac/research/OFAC-exemptions-ieepa-Legislative-History-Berman-Amendment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Berman Amendment</a>, which provides exemptions to “informational materials” like books, films, tapes, CDs, and other media containing material protected under the First Amendment, regardless of their country of origin. Passed by Congress in 1988 and authored by Democratic Representative Howard Berman, the amendment was one of the earliest obstructions in lawmakers’ attempts to ban TikTok, with a Washington Post headline calling it “<a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-ban-faces-obscure-hurdle-the-berman-amendments-11674964611\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-ban-faces-obscure-hurdle-the-berman-amendments-11674964611\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-ban-faces-obscure-hurdle-the-berman-amendments-11674964611\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an obscure hurdle</a>.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">“What this exemption does,” Mueller explains, “is make sure there’s still a free flow of information.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">A representative of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade organization representing the US music industry, tentatively confirms that the “current understanding” is that imports of records are excluded from Trump’s tariffs.</p><p class=\"paywall\">For the record industry, that’s good news. Despite the uptick in homegrown manufacturing over the past decade, which has followed from the resurgent popularity of vinyl records themselves, a great many of the albums stocking shelves of record stores are manufactured abroad. Czech-based conglomerate GZ Media is the largest record presser in the world, churning out about 70 million records a year. Under the current Berman Amendment carve-outs, all of those records could be imported Stateside without being impacted by massive tariffs. But that doesn’t mean the US vinyl industry is out of the woods. (A spokesperson for GZ declined to speak to WIRED, saying that the company has “decided not to comment on topics related to politics or tariffs.”)</p></div></div></body></html>",

I'm WIRED's director of business and industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show, we're talking about the FTC versus Meta trial. The US Federal Trade Commission is alleging that Meta illegally acquired Instagram and WhatsApp in an effort to suppress competition, and it wants to force Meta to spin off those assets into separate entities. Yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg took the stand to defend his company. We're going to get into it today. I'm joined by Paresh Dave, senior writer at WIRED, to talk about the trial. Paresh, welcome to Uncanny Valley.\nParesh Dave: Hey. Thanks, Zoë.\nZoë Schiffer: Paresh, before we get started, what's the big story here?\nParesh Dave: The FTC is trying to get Facebook to sell off WhatsApp and Instagram. That's huge.\nZoë Schiffer: That's a big deal. Let's start with what the FTC is actually arguing here, because this is something you and I have talked about in recent days. What's the theory of the case?\nParesh Dave: It's a couple of things. One, that Facebook has a long-standing monopoly on providing what's known in the FTC's parlance as personal social networking services in the US. We all know Facebook is a social media platform, but what kind of social media platform is it? In the FTC's view, it competes with Snapchat and this little-known thing called MiWi that are about connecting with friends and family. In the FTC's argument, TikTok, YouTube, all these other social media services we know of are not competitors to Facebook because those are about watching creators, not really about connecting with family and friends. One, the FTC has to establish that Facebook has this monopoly on personal social networking services, and the judge has to go along with that being the right market here. And then two, the argument is that Facebook made these acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp over a decade ago, and that the acquisitions harmed competition, being they were meant to take out competitors in this space of personal social networking services in the US. Consumers and advertisers are worse off as a result, that there's more ads that consumers are seeing. Worse advertising services. Consumers have less privacy because if there was more competition, Facebook wouldn't be able to get away with taking as much of our data. Issues like that are why the FTC say that this is a trial worth pursuing.\nZoë Schiffer: I laughed when you were talking about it only because the definition of that market seems a little bit absurd to me. The idea that TikTok isn't a competitor seems like something maybe only the FTC believes.\nParesh Dave: It does, but the FTC points to these emails from early Facebook days, right after Mark Zuckerberg created it, where he says Facebook is about connecting with family and friends. The argument being that Facebook kind of changed and evolved because it didn't have competition. And that's fuzzy, too, because we also know that Facebook copied a lot of what other companies did, but that's now for the judge to decide what the right market definition is. He was skeptical early on when this case was first filed by the FTC, and the FTC had to amend it. But if we land on this personal social networking services in the US, then Facebook commands 80 percent of that market, in the FTC's view.\nZoë Schiffer: Interesting. And what is Meta's argument? What's its pushback to the FTC's case?\nParesh Dave: Well, the first one is what we just talked about. The FTC is defining this market too narrowly, and Facebook faces tons of competition, including from TikTok in particular, and that when TikTok went down back in January as a result of the TikTok ban and the Biden-Trump transition, and there was that 12- to 14-hour period where TikTok was gone, a lot of TikTok users migrated to Facebook, is the argument. And so, Facebook is a substitute, and therefore they are competitors. Another argument is that consumers aren't actually worse off, that Instagram and WhatsApp would not have been what they are today without Meta's help, that they were these small startups with very few employees. Facebook showered them with millions of dollars a year, potentially to the tune of well over billions of dollars now, and that these services could not have thrived to the point that they are today with billions of users. And that the email in which Zuckerberg says that Facebook is about connecting with friends and family, that these acquisitions were about taking out competition, that those are all irrelevant because intent doesn't matter. What matters is whether the market has less competition, and Facebook's argument is the market doesn't have less competition, that there's very much all this competition.\nZoë Schiffer: And we are expecting Instagram founder, Kevin Systrom, to testify at some point, right?\nParesh Dave: Yeah. He's on the witness list, as are some of the venture capitalists involved that supported Instagram and WhatsApp early on.\nZoë Schiffer: We know that Mark Zuckerberg was trying to really do, it seemed, everything in his power to make sure this trial did not happen. He was reportedly trying to make a last-minute deal with President Trump, and he's been cozying up to Trump in recent months. What has that looked like?\nParesh Dave: You could imagine he of course wants to make a deal, because we're talking about two important assets for Facebook. Imagine losing that. He's trying to do whatever he can to, one, just save face and not have to have his dirty laundry aired at a big trial, but also save these two pieces of his empire. Zuckerberg, we've seen him relax Facebook and Meta policies that Republicans have criticized. He got personally involved in settling this lawsuit that Trump had filed against the company after it had banned his account back in 2021. And then Meta, which hadn't donated to Trump's first inauguration fund, did donate to Trump's second inauguration fund back in January. He's made all these overtures to try to warm this relationship, and they met a few times in recent months, but it doesn't seem like any deal was reached since the trial began.\nZoë Schiffer: Right. And even that lawsuit settlement … I've seen it described as a frivolous lawsuit. In some ways, you could categorize that as a campaign donation of sorts. That's really helpful context. We are going to take a short break, and we'll be right back. Yesterday was day one of the trial. The FTC gave its opening remarks and so did the company, and then the star witness, Mark Zuckerberg, took the stand. Let's start with what we learned from that testimony.\nParesh Dave: The government has begun its questioning of Mark Zuckerberg, and a lot of this case potentially hinges on what Zuckerberg wrote in emails and memos many, many years ago. And the government has been trying to get Zuckerberg to say that Facebook was meant to be about connecting friends and family, and that Facebook made these acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram to take out competitors, that they were freaking out because the world was moving to apps, and Facebook's apps kind of sucked. People didn't want to use them. They were buggy, and Facebook was losing out in areas like photo sharing that Instagram was just starting to really not dominate, but really taking off. And then WhatsApp was doing great in messaging, and Facebook's messaging plan was kind of all over the place. And so they needed these acquisitions. They took out competitors so they didn't have to build things themselves. And then there's this one email in which Zuckerberg says it's better to buy than compete. And so, the FTC is trying to really pin down Zuckerberg on some of these emails and what his thinking was. That was sort of day one.\nZoë Schiffer: That was Mark Zuckerberg's testimony. He's probably going to be called up again. Who else could be called up as a witness? What should we expect as the trial continues in the coming weeks?\nParesh Dave: The exact schedule isn't public, but we expect executives from competitors, such as Google, YouTube, antitrust experts, professors, to talk about that personal social networking services market. And even, I think, a big appearance could be former Facebook executive, Sheryl Sandberg.\nZoë Schiffer: I would be curious for her specifically to take the stand. I feel like this is kind of beside the point from the anticompetitive allegations, but Mark Zuckerberg has, well, in an effort, I think to ingratiate himself to Trump, rolled back a lot of the DEI efforts that Sheryl Sandberg kind of touted as core parts of her platform when she was at the company. And they've made a big show of still being friendly, but I would expect inside maybe Sheryl feels a bit different about Mark than she used to.\nParesh Dave: And I'm sure she's been involved with the months of prep that Meta has reportedly been engaged in for this trial. You could expect that they will all be on the same page here.\nZoë Schiffer: Right. Right. What happens if Meta is successful here, if Meta wins?\nParesh Dave: Well, it kind of is that nothing changes. If Meta wins, they get to keep WhatsApp and Instagram. They don't have to sell them off. Does it really send a message that the FTC should sort of not pursue actions like this where they try to unwind acquisitions from super long ago? Probably not, because the FTC doesn't usually pursue cases like this anyway, so it's sort of the status quo continues. And for startups, maybe not so great because Meta is going to be as dominant as ever.\nZoë Schiffer: What happens if the FTC wins?\nParesh Dave: That's the big one. There would be a second trial to determine remedies. What are the penalties that Meta should face? Should they be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp? Should they be blocked from doing similar acquisitions in the future? Should they be forced to share data with startups or other competitors to increase competition in the social media market? Those are all possible remedies, and the judge would basically decide what to order at a second trial.\nZoë Schiffer: It could be a while before we see anything happen with Instagram and WhatsApp even if Meta does lose.\nParesh Dave: Exactly. And add in appeals if Meta loses. Certainly, they would appeal. If the FTC loses, unclear if they would appeal, but could be years more.\nZoë Schiffer: What stands out to you in all of this? You've reported on Big Tech for a long time. There've been various attempts to break up companies in the past. I'm curious. What's the big top-line information for you right now?\nParesh Dave: To me, it kind of underscores how important it is for the FTC and the DOJ, the Department of Justice, which are the two big antitrust regulators in the US at the federal level. It sort of underscores how important it is for them to review these deals before they are finalized and consummated. I know predicting the future isn't easy. It's a tough job for regulators to balance innovation and competition and what the future is going to look like, but there's plenty of antitrust experts who believe both are possible so that we're not in this position again where we're talking about deals from 13 years ago, 11 years ago. Imagine how hard it is for a company to plan into the future if the government all of a sudden can come in and say, \"You need to break up these acquisitions that you did so long ago.\" And then on top of that, how fast the tech industry moves. If the FTC's view of the world is to believe so many startups over the last decade could have existed or thrive that never did, it is just unimaginable in some ways. We need to get better at reviewing these deals ahead of time.\nZoë Schiffer: I think that's really smart. And it's also true that Meta has done a lot to integrate the backends of these apps. It says it's to make it easier for people to talk between the different apps or view content between the different apps, but it also could have been a strategy to make unwinding these acquisitions incredibly difficult on a technical level.\nParesh Dave: Absolutely. The timing when some of those moves were first announced was viewed as kind of suspicious because it was right around when these investigations into Meta and these cases started getting filed against Big Tech companies.\nZoë Schiffer: We're going to take one more short break. And when we come back, we'll tell you what to check out on WIRED.com this week.\nZoë Schiffer: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry. I'm joined today by WIRED senior writer Paresh Dave. Before we go, Paresh, can you tell our listeners about what they have to read on WIRED.com today other than the stories we mentioned in this episode already?\nParesh Dave: Yes. Smishing Triad, the scam group stealing the world's riches.\nZoë Schiffer: Is Smishing a phishing variant?\nParesh Dave: It's a combination of phishing with SMS. Smishing, yes.\nZoë Schiffer: Smishing. Got it, got it, got it.\nParesh Dave: I'm sure we've all gotten those text messages about, \"You got to pay this toll road fee,\" or some parcel can't be delivered properly. Very annoying. I still get them all the time. I don't know why our phones can't stop this, but this story by our colleague, Matt Burgess, talks about how a lot of these messages, which are called sort of smishing messages, originate from this group of cyber criminals that is actually constantly improving their scamming software. The cybersecurity does not have the upper hand here. And my takeaway was we are going to get more and more of these messages before it gets better. And this article is part of a WIRED series, Guide to the Most Dangerous Hackers You've Never Heard Of. And this is dangerous, right? There are people who type in their credit card numbers in reply to these text messages and get all their money stolen. It's not great.\nZoë Schiffer: I feel like after I started at WIRED, I started getting messages purporting to be from company executives asking me to input personal information, which was well timed because I had just started a new job. I was like, “I don't know if they text me.” But no.\nParesh Dave: Maybe it was our cybersecurity team testing us. I don't know. I had that too.\nZoë Schiffer: They do that from time to time.\nParesh Dave: And what about you, Zoë? What are you recommending this week?\nZoë Schiffer: Well, in addition to your wonderful prewrite about the trial, which everyone should read and gives people kind of a good overview of what we should expect, we also published a piece just this morning by Caroline Haskins, another writer on the business desk at WIRED, about a New Mexico man who faces federal charges for allegedly setting fire to a Tesla showroom. This is part of the Tesla protest indictments that are happening. Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and Trump and Elon Musk have all called for the people who are engaged in violent acts against Tesla property to be charged with really, really serious crimes. And this is the second time that we know of that the FBI terrorism investigators have gotten involved in an investigation tied to the kind of public backlash against Elon Musk and Tesla in particular. Bondi said that the man in question would be going to prison for 20 years or more, even though he hasn't yet been convicted. We have a lot of detail on the allegations in the case, things that we found in the arrest warrant, and it's a really good kind of overview of what's happening on that. Paresh, thank you so much for joining me today.\nParesh Dave: Thanks for having me.\nZoë Schiffer: That's our show for today. We'll link to all the stories we spoke about in the show notes.

    "content_text": "In the coming years, agents are widely expected to take over more and more chores on behalf of humans, including using computers and smartphones. For now, though, they’re too error prone to be much use.\nA new agent called S2, created by the startup Simular AI, combines frontier models with models specialized for using computers. The agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks like using apps and manipulating files—and suggests that turning to different models in different situations may help agents advance.\n“Computer-using agents are different from large language models and different from coding,” says Ang Li, cofounder and CEO of Simular. “It’s a different type of problem.”\nIn Simular’s approach, a powerful general-purpose AI model, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o or Anthropic’s Claude 3.7, is used to reason about how best to complete the task at hand—while smaller open source models step in for tasks like interpreting web pages.\nLi, who was a researcher at Google DeepMind before founding Simular in 2023, explains that large language models excel at planning but aren’t as good at recognizing the elements of a graphical user interface.\nS2 is designed to learn from experience with an external memory module that records actions and user feedback and uses those recordings to improve future actions.\nOn particularly complex tasks, S2 performs better than any other model on OSWorld, a benchmark that measures an agent’s ability to use a computer operating system.\nFor example, S2 can complete 34.5 percent of tasks that involve 50 steps, beating OpenAI’s Operator, which can complete 32 percent. Similarly, S2 scores 50 percent on AndroidWorld, a benchmark for smartphone-using agents, while the next best agent scores 46 percent.\nVictor Zhong, a computer scientist at the University of Waterloo in Canada and one of the creators of OSWorld, believes that future big AI models may incorporate training data that helps them understand the visual world and make sense of graphical user interfaces.\n“This will help agents navigate GUIs with much higher precision,” Zhong says. “I think in the meantime, before such fundamental breakthroughs, state-of-the-art systems will resemble Simular in that they combine multiple models to patch the limitations of single models.”\nTo prepare for this column, I used Simular to book flights and scour Amazon for deals, and it seemed better than some of the open source agents I tried last year, including AutoGen and vimGPT.\nBut even the smartest AI agents are, it seems, still troubled by edge cases and occasionally exhibit odd behavior. In one instance, when I asked S2 to help find contact information for the researchers behind OSWorld, the agent got stuck in a loop hopping between the project page and the login for OSWorld’s Discord.\nOSWorld’s benchmarks show why agents remain more hype than reality for now. While humans can complete 72 percent of OSWorld tasks, agents are foiled 38 percent of the time on complex tasks. That said, when the benchmark was introduced in April 2024, the best agent could complete only 12 percent of the tasks.\nZhong says that the amount of training data available may limit how good agents can become.\nPerhaps one solution is to add human intelligence to the mix. While looking into Simular, I discovered a research project that shows how effective it can be to blend human skills with those of an AI agent.\nCowPilot, a Chrome plugin developed by a team at Carnegie Mellon University, allows a human to intervene if an AI agent gets stuck doing things. With CowPilot, I can step in and click or type if the agent seems to be dithering.\nJeffrey Bigham, a professor at CMU who oversaw the project, which was developed by his student, Faria Huq, says the idea of having a human work with an agent “is almost so obvious that it's hard to believe it's not the way most people are thinking about it.”\nMost interestingly, Bigham and Huq say that a human and agent working together can perform more tasks than either party working alone. In a limited test, the human-agent combo completed 95 percent of the jobs it was given, while requiring humans to perform only 15 percent of the total steps.\n“Web pages are often hard to use, especially if you're not familiar with a particular page, and sometimes the agent can help you find a good path through that would have taken you longer to figure out on your own,” Bigham adds.\nI don’t know about you, but I like the idea of an agent that makes me more productive and less error prone.",

    "content_text": "President Donald Trump’s tariff roller coaster has had many unexpected impacts—including threatening the sex-toy industry and possibly making smartphones dumber. But the most recent odd aftershock from his yo-yoing decisions on whether to instigate tariff hikes against China has been good news for a previously little-known app called DHgate.\nThe app has shot to near the top of the App Store charts this week, according to Sensor Tower, an analyst firm. Its success is (practically) overnight: Last week it couldn’t even crack the 100 most popular apps on Apple’s rankings.\nBut what is it, why is it popular—and, perhaps most importantly, should you use it? DHgate’s media relations team did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request to participate in this story, but ecommerce experts have shared with us their thoughts.\nWhat Is DHgate, and Where Did It Come From?\nSince 2004, DHgate has helped connect foreign buyers with Chinese manufacturers. The initials in its name is a reference to Dunhuang, a city once famed for its role in China’s ancient Silk Road trade route.\n“I remember I used to buy imported DVDs of Chinese films that you can’t buy elsewhere,” says Arnold Ma, a Chinese ecommerce expert and founder and CEO of Qumin, an UK-based marketing agency specializing in Chinese audience behaviours. “They've always been more of a B2B business, but before Alibaba became popular, for global merchants to get stock from China cheaply and in bulk.”\nThe company behind it, DHgate Group, was founded by entrepreneur and former Microsoft and Cisco employee Wang Shutong and has since grown into a behemoth: as of late 2023, 77 million registered buyers across almost every country and region in the world, around 10 million of whom have reportedly bought from 2.6 million sellers in China and elsewhere. However, some of these claims ought to be taken with a pinch of salt. Implausibly, DHgate claims buyers are located in more “countries and regions” than there are countries in the world.\nWhy Is DHgate Popular Now?\nThe growing trend of Chinese ecommerce manufacturers marketing their wares on apps like TikTok and its Chinese equivalent, Douyin, in response to Donald Trump’s tariffs against China, has raised awareness of DHgate among the public. “It’s recently got popular thanks to TikTok,” says Ma. “People are starting to wonder with the tariffs whether they can buy items from China directly.”\nThose viral videos, made by representatives of factories that claim to make products for luxury goods retailers, suggested people could counter the price increases coming from tariffs by buying unbadged versions of the same products direct from them on DHgate at a much lower cost—though there are serious questions about whether the sellers are legitimately suppliers to Western luxury brands. Search interest spiked in the past week as a result, with “China ‘Exposes’ Luxury Brands” now a trending topic on TikTok. “They’ve always wanted to dabble in B2C,” says Ma.\nHow Does DHgate Work?\nLike with almost every other shopping app, you download, log on, and search for items—but you can also access the marketplace via the company’s website. DHgate categorizes the products it sells on behalf of manufacturers into groups, while you can also search for specific items using the search bar at the top of the page. A search for “laptop” returns more than 73,000 results.\nMany of these are unbranded items; countless others are dupes of recognizable ones. Befitting its history as a business-to-business retailer, you can get discounts for buying in bulk.\nAs with any online retail transaction, it’s worth checking reviews of individual items and ratings for the sellers in question: DHgate is a marketplace, not a supplier itself. “It’s not as good as it says on TikTok videos,” says Ma. “There are still quite a lot of scammers, and there's a lot of cases where people don’t get the product that they paid for. But when you do your research, and you do go to the right merchants on DHgate, you do genuinely get really good quality products that are 80 percent the same, made in the same factories for a lot less.”\nIs It Safe to Buy From DHgate?\nThere’s no suggestion that buying items from DHgate is a risk when it comes to data collection: the platform is long-standing and a recognized name, so your credit card details are likely to be no less safe than they are on any other Chinese ecommerce platform. The app also has a buyer protection program and holds payments from sellers until buyers acknowledge receipt of their order—making it less likely you’ll be scammed.\nWhether the goods you receive will be top quality is another question. Prior to this month, DHgate was best known as a “prolific destination for designer knockoffs,” as news organizations have previously described it. In the past, WIRED has also called DHgate “one of the most established purveyors of counterfeits from China.” Indeed, if you do purchase counterfeit goods on DHgate, it could mean bought items end up seized by customs before reaching your home.\nIn 2020, DHgate launched its own in-house affiliate marketing program, which resulted in TikTok and Facebook influencers recommending products from the site, including counterfeit Golden Goose sneakers and knockoff jewelry from Van Cleef & Arpels.\n“People need to realize DHgate is a platform,” says Ma. “They don't actually guarantee the quality or the authenticity of any products on the platform.” Others suggest exercising caution. “I would say it’s likely to be hit and miss with quality,” says Ben Graham, a UK-based ecommerce specialist with more than a decade’s experience. “Some sellers will probably be really good, and some will be pretty poor.”\nThat said, the quality of some items could well be similar to many bought from third-party retailers on major Western ecommerce platforms, simply because DHgate has traditionally operated as a business-to-business company and so likely supplies wholesalers that use platforms such as Amazon and eBay. “It’s not that far removed,” says Graham. “At least you know up front\" where it has come from.\nWill Items From DHgate Be Cheaper?\nWhile Graham can recognize the lure of cheap items, he’s less certain that buying direct from the app is good value. “I would always want to go to a brand that I know has stringent quality control and is accountable to UK, US or EU standards,” he says. That’s particularly important when considering electrical goods or items with important and rigorous safety rules, such as toys.\nThere’s also the question of whether your order will be caught up at the border when imported into the US and slapped with a 145 percent China-linked tariff anyway—nullifying some or all of the price advantage you might have found by heading to the app. And while the US de minimis exemption on imports under $800 remains in place until May 2 (at the time of writing), items shipped from China can take several weeks to arrive.\nGiven the Trump administration’s focus on targeting China, it seems possible that any purchases could come with an additional import charge when they arrive on shore.\nStill, having outlined all these concerns and possible pitfalls, getting a dupe or similar purchase from DHgate could still be cheaper than buying a legitimate product from a brand retailer. “The markup is, like, a lot higher than the tariff,” says Ma.",

    "content_text": "Over the past decade, platforms like Airbnb and Turo have made it simple for people to earn extra cash by renting out their spare bedrooms or cars—but what about a pair of jeans from Zara or a lawn mower that’s been catching dust?\nIt turns out, there’s a market for that stuff too.\nRecently, a number of online services have begun to normalize peer-to-peer rentals of lower-ticket items, proving to young people that a limited run with their T-shirts, Bluetooth speakers, or chain saws—not just the nonexistent fourth bedrooms in their nonexistent three-story houses—might be of value to internet strangers, too. These apps target Gen Z and millennials, appealing to people cutting down on overconsumption, accustomed to on-demand delivery services, or just looking for a new revenue stream—power users can make up to $36,000 a year.\nPickle, a peer-to-peer clothing rental app, currently lists 200,000 items, including everything from a $100 Goldbergh Pascale headband that can be rented for $30 to a Cult Gaia dress—$898 to buy, $100 to rent. Typical customers are in their mid- to late-twenties, and the company partners with students on college campuses, which CEO and cofounder Brian McMahon calls “the perfect ecosystem” for this model to thrive. One of the app’s particularly millennial-and-Gen-Z-friendly features is its door-to-door delivery service (offered in Los Angeles, New York, and Miami) which is “like DoorDash for clothes,” McMahon says.\n“That's why the company's called Pickle. If you're in a pickle, you could still get something at the last minute.” He says business goes especially well on weekends. “Plans come up, and people are like, ‘I need something.’”\nAccording to Arun Sundararajan, professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business and author of The Sharing Economy, rental platforms for clothes and household items emerged between 2011 and 2013, around the same time as those for home and car rentals took off. But “they didn't attract venture capital in the same way that the automobile and home rental platforms did, or the way that Uber and Lyft and the others did,” he says. That’s partially just because there’s a lot more money to be made from a car or a house.\nStill, Pickle says it has tripled its number of monthly active users year over year and in March announced it had raised $12 million in Series A funding.\nSundararajan says the popularity of these apps represents a shift toward more responsible consumerism and a decline in the fixation on owning things. “I think Instagram had a lot to do with this. People who grew up seeing other people's vacations on Instagram are more wired to think of value as coming not from what you own but what you experience,” he says. “They’re more likely to say, ‘Well, why should I buy this if I can just sort of get it, experience it, and then give it back?’”\nBeccah Erickson, a 33-year-old product designer living in Brooklyn, has both listed and rented through Pickle. While she’s had success as a customer—she rented a seashell-shaped statement purse for a wedding last summer—finding takers for her own items has been more of a struggle. She’s had two Pickle users come over to her place to try on a dress, but both ultimately declined to rent it because of the fit. She feels the platform’s demographic runs disproportionately thin.\n“In New York a lot of the people listing stuff are of a certain age and size,” she says, adding that it could be “harder” for people who wear larger sizes to find items. Pickle tells WIRED it is working to address this issue by partnering with “creators, influencers, and tastemakers across a wider range of body types and aesthetics.”\nErickson’s own wedding is coming up, and she’s considering renting her bridal accessories, primarily in an effort to make environmentally conscious choices. “When I buy something new it's very considered and I've wanted it for a long time, so I use rentals for more of the fun items or one-off use cases,” she says. “I definitely like the kind of circular fashion aspect of it.” She says she hasn’t encountered any negative stigma surrounding her choice to rent instead of buy, which she attributes to the popularity of non-peer-to-peer rental platforms like Rent the Runway.\nThe financial burden of attending weddings is also what drew fellow Brooklyn resident Jane Kim, 35, to Pickle. “I don't want to have to buy another sand-colored dress,” says Kim, who has been a bridesmaid at multiple friends’ weddings. “I've already spent $600 on beige-sand dresses.” She rents out her own clothes as well and makes around $200 a month on the platform.\nWhile Pickle’s selection heavily features high fashion, the platform welcomes any in-demand item, regardless of its price point or brand, including low-cost pieces from brands like Urban Outfitters and Edikted. The highest earning “lenders”—users who list their items for rent—earned more than $3,000 monthly in 2024. Pickle takes a 20 percent cut of each transaction.\nPickle plans to expand its scope of inventory, first to men's clothing and eventually beyond the clothing and accessory space.\nYoodlize, a Utah-based app that operates near three college campuses, allows users to rent party supplies (bounce houses, tables and chairs), tools (tile cutters, really tall ladders), electronics (cameras, PA systems, karaoke machines), and outdoor sporting equipment like paddleboards.\n“We do get a pretty wide age distribution, but we feel like we're building this for the Gen X, Gen Z, millennials,” says Jason Fairbourne, Yoodlize’s CEO and founder. “Our biggest demographic are still in college or in high school at this moment.

Pickle tells WIRED it is working to address this issue by partnering with “creators, influencers, and tastemakers across a wider range of body types and aesthetics.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Erickson’s own wedding is coming up, and she’s considering renting her bridal accessories, primarily in an effort to make environmentally conscious choices. “When I buy something new it's very considered and I've wanted it for a long time, so I use rentals for more of the fun items or one-off use cases,” she says. “I definitely like the kind of circular fashion aspect of it.” She says she hasn’t encountered any negative stigma surrounding her choice to rent instead of buy, which she attributes to the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/just-rent-your-clothes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">popularity of non-peer-to-peer rental platforms like Rent the Runway</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The financial burden of attending weddings is also what drew fellow Brooklyn resident Jane Kim, 35, to Pickle. “I don't want to have to buy another sand-colored dress,” says Kim, who has been a bridesmaid at multiple friends’ weddings. “I've already spent $600 on beige-sand dresses.” She rents out her own clothes as well and makes around $200 a month on the platform.</p><p class=\"paywall\">While Pickle’s selection heavily features high fashion, the platform welcomes any in-demand item, regardless of its price point or brand, including low-cost pieces from brands like Urban Outfitters and Edikted. The highest earning “lenders”—users who list their items for rent—earned more than $3,000 monthly in 2024.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nA Beard Trimmer is a blessedly straightforward device that can have widely disparate results. Different beards require wildly different visions of the best beard trimmers, depending on hair type and style. And quality matters. Cheap blades don't save money if they die young. The Wahl Peanut is a classic for a reason, and our top pick Braun Series 9 beard trimmer ($150) has endured years of continual testing by WIRED reviewers. The last thing anybody needs in the morning is a dull or underpowered trimmer pushing your hair around instead of cutting it—or even worse, pulling your hair.\nThe shopping-aisle rainbow of trimmers advertising “professional precision” and “lifetime blades” without corresponding warranties can be daunting to sort through. We consulted barbers and hair pros, then we turned these blades to our very own faces. Our team includes multiple testers with different morning routines, with multiple versions and visions of beard. Whether you're aiming for rugged stubble, tight-detailed geometry, or the well-tended thatch of an elegant lumberjack, we have a pick for you.\nFor more grooming guides, check out the Best Hair Dryers, Best Curling Irons, and Best Hair Straighteners. For general mannitude, check out our Gifts for Manly Men.\nUpdated April 2025: We added the Peanut Li; retested the Philips OneBlade and Panasonic Multishape; updated device models; and reorganized, updated, and checked prices throughout.\n|Up Next\n|I'm currently testing the BabylissPro GoldFX+ and the Babyliss x Tomb45 trimmer with wireless charging mat, as well as multiple models from Wahl including the Wahl Magic Clip, Wahl Manscaper, and a retest of the Wahl Pro Skeleton.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nA Guide to Trimmer Tech\nHere's some help on choosing the right features for your facial fuzz.\n- Ceramic versus steel blades: Ceramic blades can hold their sharpness better than steel, but the smaller teeth of premium beard trimmer blades tend to be made of stainless steel.\n- Barrel control: Some beard trimmers have on-device twist controls. For an easier life, pick one with minimal attachments. But there can be a trade-off in accuracy and added unwieldiness. Such dials also add a failure point to the trimmer guard.\n- Ni-MH versus Li-ion: Avoid trimmers with excessively long charge times and those that use old nickel-metal-hydride batteries. They don't hold their charge as long as lithium-ion.\n- Waterproof? Beard trimming in the shower isn’t as precise a process as wet shaving, but a water-resistant design does let you wash your trimmer under the faucet with confidence.\n- USB charging: It took far too long, but USB charging cables for beard trimmers have now become a fairly standard accessory, often in addition to proprietary charging ports. A major bonus for travel.\n- Small versus larger teeth: Larger blade teeth can cut thick, dense hair, but smaller teeth allow for a closer, more precise cut. The latter is exemplified by the Philips OneBlade family.\n- Wide versus narrow blade: Hair trimmers have wider blade surfaces than beard trimmers. The narrower style of beard trimmer provides greater control, with minimal time loss for those with shorter facial hair.\n- Do blades need to be replaced? Use blade oil (often included) to avoid rusting, and blades should last for years. Trimmer-shaver hybrid Philips OneBlade will need more regular replacements, though.\n- Vacuum? Some beard trimmers have a vacuum feature, to avoid getting hair trimmings everywhere. It's often a gimmick, but it's a gimmick for a reason: Beard trimmings are the worst. We'll be adding coverage of beard hair vacuums in future coverage.\nHow We Test\nA beard grows about a millimeter every two or three days, depending on who you are—an eighth of an inch a week, on average. So testing beard trimmers can take a long time.\nIn general, we test each beard trimmer once a beard has grown out enough for a good trim—using at least two cutting lengths. Weight and balance matters, and so does the blade's ability to get to the awkward areas around the neck. We check the trimmer's ability to function as a shaver, whether for balding or on the neck.\nOur testers check how well-made and easy to use any attachments are, and we verify manufacturer claims about battery life and power. We also check in with professional haircutters, especially to verify claims of durability and reliability among brands and models.\nTester Matthew Korfhage has coarse and angry hairs, with a seeming mind of their own. Tester Andrew Williams has a relatively full beard, with straight-growing stubble. We've tried to reflect any possible issues—struggling with thick bristles, for instance—in our reviews, so you can be sure of the best possible trim with the least amount of effort. And we might run a blade into a horsehair broom, to test a motor's power, and its likelihood of bogging down when faced with a thick, full beard.\nWe Also Recommend\nPanasonic Multishape for $80: We'd previously had this one among our top picks, and quite frankly its toothbrush and nose trimmer attachment are oddly terrific. Its versatility means it remains excellent as a travel kit. But the whole kit is also bulky, and so even in the travel bag it's unclear you're saving space for travel by bringing this big ol’ thing along.\nWahl Stainless Steel Lithium for $73: This Wahl series has been around since 2011, and remains a beautifully sleek, almost art deco beard trimmer with more than two hours of life on its Lithium battery, if not quite as much as advertised. But there are also a lot of attachments to swap out, and a somewhat clumsy adjustable stubble trimmer that might require multiple passes.\nAlso Tested\nPhilips Norelco 9000 Series 9810 for $100: The Philips BT 9810 is a self-consciously styled luxury beard trimmer with hefty brushed metal, and a broad base that lets it stand up vertically, and an adjustable steel blade system for close trims up to 5 mm (about 3/16\"), minutely adjustable for fades. Plastic guards serve beyond this length. That said, tester Andrew Williams found this metal blade system a bit hard on his skin for tight or stubbly shaves.\nBraun Series 7 Manscaping Clippers for $100: This Braun is a fast-charging all-over body trimmer with a quiet motor and an “AutoSense” tech to modulate motor power to adapt to thicker/coarser hair. There's a wealth of attachments for hair, as well as a Gillette razor for shaves. But the Series 7's ratcheted beard adjustment system doesn't offer great control, noted tester Andrew Williams, and going very short requires attachments. Battery life is also not overly impressive.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nWhen Nintendo officially revealed the Switch 2 back in January, it confirmed long-standing rumors that the new handheld console would enjoy backward compatibility with the games from the original Switch—physically and digitally. Good news, but there was one disclaimer: \"Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.\"\nThat sent some players into, if not a panic, at least a period of confusion. Given that the original Switch launched in 2017, many have built sizable collections in that time, and the uncertainty over which among them would continue to be playable on the new generation of hardware was cause for concern. But things are looking better than expected, with the Switch 2 supporting some of the most niche titles in the Switch library, even those that required physical peripherals unique to the original hardware.\nIn an update posted to Nintendo's official site, the company revealed that nearly 100 percent of first-party games remain compatible with Switch 2 hardware, with “no issues found during basic compatibility testing” for 122 games published by Nintendo. On a bar chart, a tiny sliver of red, indicating “not compatible,” amounts to just one game.\nThat unfortunate outlier? Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit, Nintendo's ambitious build-it-yourself virtual reality headset made of cardboard. The entire Labo line was aimed at kids, providing tactile experiences where you'd build steering wheels or robot suits, then play dedicated games built around the kit-bashed gadgets. The VR Kit took things to another level, providing the materials to build rudimentary goggles and a mock blaster. When constructed, the Switch tablet slotted into place while lenses split the onscreen image into a “My first VR”-level experience.\nIt's that specific physical combination of console and cardboard that makes Labo VR Kit the only original Switch game incompatible with Switch 2. Nintendo explains that “the Nintendo Switch 2 console cannot be inserted into the Toy-Con VR Goggles accessory, so this game cannot be played.” That's it. The Switch 2 simply doesn't fit the headset, so VR Kit becomes the only first-party game jettisoned into the tides of gaming history.\nEven other Labo games can be used on Switch 2, thanks to what may prove to be the new console's secret weapon when it comes to backward compatibility—you can still use original Switch Joy-Cons on Switch 2. Nintendo says that if “you have Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers and connect them wirelessly to Nintendo Switch 2, you can play [select] games as you would on Nintendo Switch.” That's great news, opening the doors for far more of the Switch's software library to remain accessible than expected.\nA Healthy Choice\nPerhaps the biggest surprise is that Switch 2 will continue to support Ring Fit Adventure. When the new console was announced with that caveat about compatibility, I was sure Ring Fit would be cut from the roster, primarily because of hardware compatibility. The fitness role-playing game requires the right-hand Joy-Con controller to be physically slotted onto its Pilates-style ring peripheral, which uses a slide bracket that could not accommodate a new, magnetically connected Joy-Con 2 from the Switch 2.\nMuch to my delight, though, you can play Ring Fit on the Switch 2. You just need to keep a pair of original Switch Joy-Cons to hand (the left Joy-Con is still required to slot into Ring Fit's leg strap to track lower body movement—Nintendo says that Joy-Con 2 won't fit). Given that Joy-Cons can be charged using a Joy-Con charging grip or a stand-alone dock, I may not even have to keep my Switch OLED set up to keep them juiced. This is great, since it's one of the games that helped me lose a lot of weight, and aside from the health benefits, it remains genuinely fun to play.\nSeveral other first-party Nintendo games that wouldn't work natively on Switch 2 because of technological differences of the Joy-Con 2s are saved by the continued support for the classic Joy-Cons. For example, the new controllers lack the infrared motion camera built into the right-hand grip on the preceding generation, which would block 1-2-Switch!, a mini-game collection and launch title for the original Switch. Instead, you'll be able to continue to enjoy its dozens of quick-fire party games if that's your jam.\nFor the 2023 sequel, Everybody 1-2-Switch!, it doesn't appear you'll even need the original Joy-Cons. The only compatibility warning Nintendo gives is that the volume of the haptic feedback is quieter on Joy-Con 2s, so it might make one specific mini-game a bit harder. Elsewhere, Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the global phenomenon Wii Sports, gets the same leg strap warning as Ring Fit Adventure (clearly a fitness game thing), while Game Builder Garage and WarioWare: Move It! require that IR reader.\nBack, Back, Backward Compatibility\nThe Switch 2's solid backward compatibility support looks to extend to even older hardware as well. The GameCube adapter is still supported. Unlike the upcoming wireless recreation launching alongside Switch 2 to allow authentic playback of the digital GameCube games (if you subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online), these are hub-like accessories that allow up to four original, wired GameCube controllers to be connected to the Wii U, Switch, and now Switch 2.\nNintendo confirms that “this accessory can be used in TV mode by connecting via a USB Cable on the Nintendo Switch 2 dock.” I presume there'll be a small extra step involved here, as most models use a USB-A connector, so you'd presumably need a USB-A to USB-C widget to bridge the gap, since there is no USB-A port on the dock.\nWhile previously, the GameCube adapter was only supported on the original Switch for very specific games, chiefly Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Nintendo has now confirmed that \"Nintendo GameCube—Nintendo Classics can also be played with an original Nintendo GameCube controller via the GameCube Controller Adapter for Wii U\". That means you'll be able to play any of the GameCube games coming to Nintendo Switch Online with classic controllers, if you still have any laying around. The line starts with The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, SoulCalibur II, and F-Zero GX, with titles including Super Mario Sunshine, Pokémon Colosseum, and Luigi's Mansion set to follow later.\nUnfortunately, things are not so rosy with third-party games. Nintendo has identified 141 games with startup issues on the Switch 2, meaning they may not launch reliably or at all, and 47 others that boot up on the new hardware, but “include some in-game compatibility issues.” In all cases, the company is still investigating the issue, and compatibility issues for these titles may be resolved by the June 5 launch date of the console. But it could also rise too—there are over 12,000 Switch games, so more issues could crop up, but the ratio is pretty good right now.\nUpdated May 6: Nintendo confirmed the original GameCube controllers will support more games, and we've updated this story to reflect this news.",

You probably don't wait as long to upgrade your phone, but that's what the DIY supplier iFixit and the refurbished device retailer Back Market want to change.\nAhead of Earth Day on April 22, the two companies have partnered to launch a marketing campaign that encourages consumers to replace their phones every five years instead of the national average of two and a half to three years.\nThe responsibility of keeping older tech alive isn't just falling on you, though. The two companies are also asking policymakers and manufacturers to extend smartphone parts and software support to 10 years. Phone makers like Apple, Google, and Samsung support devices for about seven years, though most phones from other manufacturers get half that, if not less.\nBy replacing the battery and holding onto an iPhone 13 for five years instead of replacing the whole phone after the typical two and a half years, for example, the device's carbon emissions are cut by 49 percent—which could prevent 15.6 million tons of CO2 emissions per year. If you could keep it running for 10 years with repairs and refurbishment, those emissions would be reduced by 68 percent. Back Market says these numbers are calculated from various sources, like Apple's Product Environment Reports, studies on refurbishment emissions, repair emissions from the Fairphone 5, and more.\nThe partnership extends further: Back Market, which sells refurbished tech like phones, laptops, and even gaming consoles, will feature iFixit's how-to-repair guides on its app and on the web, beginning with iPhone repair guides. That way, instead of immediately trading your phone in for a discount on a refurbished model, you have an option to check out a repair guide and try a fix yourself. Many repairs are common and simple, like replacing the screen or the battery.\nYou'll also be able to buy iFixit's repair toolkit directly from Back Market. And if you're browsing iFixit but decide you don't have the time or energy to go through with a repair, you'll see options to trade in your device to Back Market for a refurbished model.\n“We have the same fight,” Thibaud Hug de Larauze, CEO of Back Market, tells WIRED. “We want to extend the life of a tech product to make it more convenient for people when they have, let's say, a smartphone that is running out of battery or they have a broken screen—the vast majority of people upgrade to a new device, and we're here to offer them an alternative.”\nThe announcement comes during a tumultuous trade war between the US and China. While President Donald Trump exempted some electronics, like smartphones and laptops, from the 145 percent reciprocal tariffs on China, these products are still facing a hefty 20 percent tariff. Laurauze says last week, Back Market saw its growth triple as consumers snapped up refurbished electronics due to fears of price hikes.\nTariffs may not directly impact the used smartphone market much since all of these devices are available in the US. However, it will make repairs costlier, because the parts still come from other countries, and refurbished phones will likely cost more due to higher demand.\n“I think it is likely that tariffs and costs will go up on new devices—that seems safe to assume,\" says Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit. \"In that world, we'd want to keep things running longer. Even if repair part prices go up slightly due to tariffs, they'll still end up being dramatically cheaper to repair than to buy a new one.”\nWiens says the big US carriers export many used smartphones to other countries, but that could change in the post-tariff world. That might mean more used smartphone options to choose from at your carrier store, especially if consumers cannot afford a new device.\nThe tariff chaos is also coinciding with some wins for the right-to-repair movement. According to Public Interest Research Group, there are currently 41 repair bills in progress across 20 states, covering various products from consumer tech to farm and lawn equipment. If these bills become laws, they would force manufacturers to make their products more repairable while opening up access to tools, instruction manuals, and spare parts for regular consumers.\nAll to say, if there was ever a time to start learning how to keep your devices in good working order longer, it's now.",

Mars, for example, is the closest celestial body to Earth in terms of distance, but data shows its conditions are extremely hostile for life.\nDespite this, NASA has plans to send astronauts to the Red Planet, and Elon Musk is a vocal proponent of establishing a human presence there. In the short term, the solution to colonizing Mars is the construction of special enclosed habitats. But in the long term, some have suggested a more ambitious strategy. Space colonization enthusiasts propose terraforming Mars—that is, transforming the planet to acquire characteristics similar to those of Earth.\nScientists accept that any proposal for terraforming Mars is decades away, although calculations are already underway to assess how this titanic process might work. Leszek Czechowski, a professor at the Institute of Geophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, has proposed how to convert the rusty-colored planet into a place where humans can walk without spacesuits. To achieve this, the researcher suggests bombarding it with asteroids from the far reaches of the solar system.\nMars is a desert planet, devoid of oxygen, and with an atmosphere so thin that it prevents the accumulation of liquid water on its surface. None of these characteristics will be changed if the lack of atmospheric pressure is not addressed first. If a person goes unprotected onto the Martian surface, they will not die from suffocation or freezing, but because their blood will boil almost instantly due to the lack of atmosphere.\nOn Earth, atmospheric pressure is due to the total mass of gases contained in its dense atmosphere. Here, at sea level, the pressure is equivalent to 101,325 pascals; on Mars it barely reaches 600 pascals, less than 1 percent of Earth’s pressure. So to begin terraforming, scientists must first thicken the Martian atmosphere. Other major challenges, such as extreme temperatures, protection from solar radiation, and the presence of water, would then be addressed in subsequent phases.\nEvery scientist exploring the terraforming of Mars comes to the same conclusion: There is simply not enough material on the planet to change its atmosphere, and any attempt to transport elements there represents an unprecedented energy expenditure.\nCzechowski’s solution to this problem is to bombard the planet with asteroids. In his proposal, a large asteroid would be launched directly at Hellas Planitia, a huge impact crater in the southern hemisphere of Mars. According to this theory, the impact of a sizable asteroid, containing elements essential for the planet’s habitability, would cause Mars to heat up while also causing its atmosphere to thicken.\nBut this cannot be just any asteroid—it has to be one with abundant water and nitrogen. That immediately rules out anything from the solar system’s asteroid belt, which lies between Jupiter and Mars. Rather, any large rock would need to come from the Kuiper belt, the disc of material that surrounds the outer solar system and is full of frozen objects and primordial water.\nHumans of the future would have to go directly to this remote region to select the ideal asteroid and attach a propellant to it. This would then be used to slow the orbiting asteroid down, allowing it to be drawn into the inner regions of the solar system by the sun’s gravitational pull. Further bursts of propellant, as well as exploiting the gravitational fields of other planets, would then be used to make sure the asteroid ends up colliding with Mars, with the asteroid’s journey estimated to take anywhere from 29 to 63 years. Upon impact, the elements of the asteroid would be expected to fuse with the Martian environment and, hopefully, trigger volcanic processes that will contribute to the formation of a denser, more life-friendly atmosphere.\n“The creation of an atmosphere that allows human life is possible by importing matter from other celestial bodies,” Czechowski explains in his paper, which he shared at the annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, LPSC 2025. The amount of energy needed to get to the Kuiper belt and then propel an asteroid to Mars could be equivalent to several years of total energy consumption here on Earth, Czechowski estimates. “Due to the enormous amount of energy required, a power plant based on a thermonuclear reactor (running on local hydrogen) and an ion engine seems to be the most suitable option” for powering the mission, he writes.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "content_text": "Attorneys suing the United States government over its use of vanishing Signal messages to coordinate military strikes last month in Yemen allege that new court filings by the government reveal a “calculated strategy” by Trump administration officials to evade transparency laws through the illegal destruction of government records.\nUS defense and intelligence agencies on Monday submitted supplemental declarations in court outlining their individual efforts to preserve the messages at the center of the “SignalGate” scandal. American Oversight, a watchdog organization whose attorneys are suing the government, claim the declarations reveal “troubling inconsistencies” in efforts by US officials to archive the material, with the Central Intelligence Agency in particular alleging that it had archived no messages of any substance.\n“Using encrypted, disappearing messages on Signal for official government business violates the Federal Records Act and represents a calculated strategy to undermine transparency and accountability,” claims the group’s interim executive director, Chioma Chukwu.\nThe use of the private group chat—in which some messages were configured to automatically delete before they could be archived—was first revealed by The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, on March 24, after he was inadvertently added to the group by Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz. American Oversight subsequently filed Freedom of Information Act requests over the chats and then sought a temporary restraining order in a Washington, DC, federal court in an effort to compel the government to salvage any messages yet to be deleted.\nIn addition to Waltz, known participants in the chat group include, among others, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.\nWIRED has requested comment from the Justice Department, the Office of the National Intelligence Director, and the White House. The departments of Defense and State declined to comment. The CIA could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe declarations filed by the government late Monday show a scattershot attempt by multiple agencies to comply with the court’s demands, with several days elapsing during their various individual efforts to obtain and preserve the messages.\nJudge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, issued his initial order to preserve the communications on March 27, while giving each agency four days to describe what actions were being taken to obey. “We were really trying to seek preservation of Signal chats more broadly,” American Oversight’s deputy chief counsel, Katie Anthony, tells WIRED. “But the court was not willing to step outside the one specific chat we all knew about for certain.\"\nThe declarations ultimately offered scant information about the methods that were employed to preserve the messages or the degrees to which those methods are forensically sound. And it is unclear from the disclosures what portion of the chat—alleged to cover five days in early March—might have been irretrievable by that time. According to reporting by The Atlantic, some of the messages concerning the military strikes, which targeted Houthi fighters in Yemen, were set to delete automatically after four weeks. Others were reportedly set to disappear after only one.\nThe US Treasury Department was initially alone in providing the court a timeline of the messages that it was able to retrieve. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had received a preservation memo on March 26, his acting general counsel said, as well as advice regarding his fundamental duty to preserve records. Resultingly, \"images were taken from the phones of Secretary Bessent and Mr. [Daniel] Katz,\" Bessent’s chief of staff. The messages begin at 1:48 pm EST on March 15, 2025.\n\"The Atlantic article was about a chat that took place the 11th through the 15th,” Anthony says, “so pretty much everything was gone—from the only defendant who gave us clear and specific information about what they were able to save.”\nThe Department of Defense told the court last month that its attorneys were \"in the process\" of complying with the agency's preservation rules and that Secretary Hegseth’s communications team had been asked to forward the Signal messages to an official DOD account. Pressed by the court for further details last week, the DOD said Monday that a search of Hegseth's device had been conducted \"on or about March 27,\" adding that screenshots of the \"existing Signal application messages\" had been preserved.\nAmerican Oversight’s lawyers had urged the court to seek greater specificity, arguing on April 4 that \"vague, incomplete assertions\" in the government's original declarations had only cast fresh doubts on its \"purported efforts\" to preserve the chats. In light of new reporting, the group argued, the government's response seemed otherwise \"grossly inadequate.\" Politico had reported two days prior that as many as 20 private Signal chat groups had been started by Waltz’s team with a slew of cabinet officials.\n“It seems very likely that the individuals who are defendants in our lawsuit are probably involved in some of those other chats, and we have this problem on a much wider basis,” Anthony says.\nThe Department of Justice, meanwhile, opposed the court’s involvement, arguing that its efforts on behalf of a watchdog group were legally confused and that the question of whether any laws were broken is in any case moot. Members of the public, it argued, have no \"enforceable rights” when it comes to challenging the destruction of specific government records. A court order was unnecessary, the department said, because the government was already taking steps to do what is required. A “partial version of the chat” had already been committed to a federal record keeping system, it said, by “at least one agency.”\nAmong other new details, Monday’s disclosures provided a range of dates for the preservation efforts at multiple agencies, including the date that Hegseth’s phone was finally “searched.”\nScreenshots of chats on Marco Rubio's phone were likewise captured on March 27, the State Department said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said its screenshots were taken the following day, on March 28. The CIA said it took a screenshot of the chat on March 31; however, it also clarified one of its previous declarations to the court, revealing that the image shows mainly the name of the chat group and some of its members and settings but not any of its “substantive messages.”\nAmerican Oversight previewed a case to amend its initial complaint during a hearing last week, with plans to encourage the court to expand the scope of its review to include the now-reported widespread use of Signal by top officials across the national security state.\n“This attack on government transparency threatens the very foundation of our democracy,” Chukwu says. “And we are committed to using every legal tool available to expose the truth and hold those responsible accountable.”",

    "content_text": "The anonymous image board 4chan has survived years of controversy. It weathered user and advertiser boycotts as well as damning accusations that it incubated hate speech that may have fueled mass shootings. Users have convened on 4chan to plan hacks like DDoS attacks, and conspiracy theories that festered on 4chan even reportedly inspired the January 6 insurrection at the United States Capitol. On Monday night and Tuesday, though, the platform faced its latest test after a series of outages led to speculation that the site had been hacked.\nThe core feature 4chan provides is public anonymity to post text and images, but the platform itself does collect information about users, such as their IP addresses. As a result, a breach of the website could represent a significant exposure of data that was intended to be private.\n“4chan is an anonymous message board that enables often offensive and hateful content. The content leaked, if genuine, would remove some of the anonymity from 4chan administrators, moderators, and janitors,” says Ian Gray, director of analysis and research at the security firm Flashpoint. The image board’s billing as an “anonymous” platform may have given users a “false sense of security,” Gray says. “Some users may have registered their email addresses years ago when they were less aware or concerned about their operational security.”\nReports about the apparent hack began circulating after a previously banned board on 4chan briefly appeared online and the site was defaced with a message saying, “U GOT HACKED XD.” Subsequently, an online account on a rival forum known as Soyjak.party posted screenshots allegedly showing 4chan’s backend systems, plus a list of alleged 4chan administrator and moderator usernames, with associated email addresses. Following this post of 4chan administrator email addresses, Soyjak.party users started posting alleged doxes, including photos and personal information, of the accounts included in the leak.\nWIRED has not been able to confirm whether the data is legitimate. A press email address associated with 4chan as well as two alleged administrator emails from the leaked data did not immediately respond to WIRED’s requests for comment on the hack and its validity. One of the site’s moderators said they believed the hack and leaks were real, according to a report by TechCrunch.\nRumors also started circulating on Tuesday that the breach is the result of 4chan running legacy, unpatched software that exposed the platform to attack. After a breach a decade ago, 4chan founder Christopher Poole, known online as “moot,” wrote in a blog post, “[We] have spent—and will continue to spend—dozens of hours poring over our software and systems to help mitigate and prevent future intrusions. We’re sorry it happened, and will do our best to ensure it doesn’t happen again.”\nEmiliano De Cristofaro, a computer science and engineering professor at UC Riverside, who has researched the impact of 4chan on the web, says the ramifications could be large if the hack is confirmed.\n“It seems true that 4chan hasn't been properly maintained and patched for years, which might indicate that a hack would have definitely been a possibility,” De Cristofaro says. “There might be some ‘high profile’ users exposed as moderators—traditionally, 4chan users hate them, so they might be targeted. It might be hard or at least painfully slow and costly for 4chan to recover from this, so we might really see the end of 4chan as we know it.”\nInitial reports posted on Soyjak.party referencing a 4chan hack appeared to say that Soyjak.party members may have been involved in the attack. One post claimed that a hacker had been in 4chan’s systems “for over a year” and exposed personal information allegedly linked to 4chan users and administrators. And multiple screenshots posted on Soyjak.party appear to show someone accessing 4chan’s internal systems. These include images of someone with administrator access to a 4chan backend database, stats about users on various sections of 4chan, a page showing deleted posts and the IP addresses they were made from, as well as other internal documentation. Some reports also claim that hackers stole 4chan’s source code.\nIn recent years, 4chan has increasingly been on the radar of US government officials. The website has reportedly been kept online due in part to investment by a Japanese company. In June 2023, WIRED reported on internal 4chan documents that showed how the site’s policies shaped the highly toxic nature of the platform—including how moderators explicitly allow racism. In most cases, the documents showed, calls for violence on 4chan are not met with user bans.\n“If the data is legitimate, information on members and posting could be useful for law enforcement investigations,” Flashpoint’s Gray says. “4chan has been around since at least 2003, which is extremely notable for any online service. Aside from the offensive and often extremist content, a lot of internet culture has originated from 4chan. If this is a death knell for 4chan, other services will likely fill its place. However, the effect of 4chan on the internet cannot be overstated.”",

    "content_text": "T. Thomason’s US touring visa doesn’t expire until June—but the Canadian pop artist is pulling out of a festival appearance in Belfast, Maine, next month because he doesn’t want to be targeted at the border as a nonbinary trans man.\nLast week, Thomason, 30, who splits his time between Toronto and Wolfville, Nova Scotia, announced he had dropped out of the All Roads Festival, which takes place May 16-17. He tells WIRED he made the decision after seeing President Donald Trump’s executive orders targeting the trans community, including one proclaiming that the US government will recognize only two sexes, male and female. He’s also been increasingly fearful after hearing stories of visitors, US visa-holders, and applicants being held at the border, including a Vancouver woman who told The Guardian she was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for two weeks.\n“I just thought if that’s happening to cis people, I really feel worried about what could happen to me,” Thomason says.\nToronto- and Montreal-based singer Bells Larsen, a trans man, also announced Friday that he is canceling his spring tour because the gender on his passport, male, does not match his assigned sex at birth, potentially disqualifying him from being eligible for a US visa under the Trump administration's new rules. Aya Sinclair, a London-based musician and trans woman, told Pitchfork she’ll be avoiding American shows “until anything changes.” Even Neil Young, a dual Canadian-American citizen, has said he’s worried about being “jailed” upon returning to the States, due to his criticisms of Trump.\nBut the decision not to play in America means foregoing touring income and the opportunity to build one’s fanbase in the largest music market in the world. And simply rerouting to Europe or elsewhere abroad, particularly for Canadian artists, is a costly endeavor.\nThe American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada, a union that can petition the federal government to grant touring visas, told Canadian members in late March that the updated immigration rule “runs afoul of our shared values. At this time, it is unlikely the US government will pivot from this objectionable position.”\nLos Angeles–based entertainment attorney Dani Oliva, a trans man, tells WIRED “there’s been a general panic” among his clients in the past few weeks. Oliva, who is Thomason’s lawyer, notes that Canadian musicians who want to play in the US have two options for visas, one of which costs up to $8,000 and is “extremely onerous.” He says processing times for his clients have jumped from three or four months to eight to 10 months without paying for expedited processing.\nHe says he does a risk-versus-benefit analysis for each client looking to come to the US. But he’s worried that trans clients’ visa requests could be denied on the grounds of “misrepresentation or fraud” if the gender on the identifying documents they submit doesn’t match up with their assigned sex at birth. That finding could result in a person being banned from the US for life unless they successfully apply for a waiver—a cumbersome process.\nDespite the headaches of getting a US visa, there’s a reason people do it: money and cultural cachet.\n“Let’s be real. I mean, so many artists only find their breakthrough if they tour in America,” says Kurt Dahl, a Vancouver-based entertainment lawyer. “There’s 10 times the population; it’s just more likely to get press and get attention.”\nWhile he says almost every Canadian he knows, artist or not, is reevaluating taking trips across the border, some of his clients’ fanbases are 80 percent American.\n“I just see them sort of scrubbing their social media, scrubbing their cell phone of anything that might be considered controversial, and then sort of rolling the dice.”\nThere’s also the geography. In Canada, he says, sometimes a band is driving 10 hours to the next city, whereas in the US they might be able to hit 30 cities in a much shorter span.\nThomason says Trump’s border crackdown has forced artists like him to rethink goals they’ve been working toward for “years and years and years.” He says he won’t be entering the US as long as Trump is president. Even if he wanted to tour here, he believes any of his new visa applications would be denied because he’s changed the gender marker on his passport to male.\n“The end goal for a lot of artists is to end up in places like New York or LA and build their careers out from there. It’s kind of taking your dreams and completely changing them.”\nHe says he’s “really, really sad” that his connection to his US fans is being “severed” at a time when he was just starting to build it. His friend and fellow artist Larsen, meanwhile, noted on Instagram on Friday that he was hoping to play his album Blurring Time “for queer and trans people in the US who saw their stories reflected in my own.” The album blends Larsen’s vocals both pre- and post-transition.\nTo help make up for the income loss, Thomason is advocating for Canadian arts groups to develop new funding streams for trans artists. But he also says this is an issue that will go far beyond trans artists in Canada, or trans people around the world.\n“This is a country undermining the validity of a government-issued document by another country,” he says. “If people think that starts and stops with trans people, they’re wrong.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nZach Sharpe is really good at pinball.\nI'm standing with Sharpe, director of marketing at Stern Pinball, in the company's top-secret, badge-accessed Pinball Alley, located inside its headquarters in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, (a suburb 20 miles northwest of Chicago, the pinball capital of the world). And the game we’re playing is none other than Stern's newest title, King Kong: Myth of Terror Island. The games are available in Pro, Premium, and 932 Limited Edition (LE) models, with prices starting at $6,999.\nThis title has been guessed at by Reddit sleuths and arcade bloggers with a penchant for monitoring trademark filings, teased by Stern on social media, and after getting exclusive hands-on early access, I’m happy to report that the new machine is my favorite Stern release since 2021.\nI first got into pinball at CES in 2020. I was playing the newly launched Stranger Things, and while I flipped frantically and hoped for the best, this nice gentleman with long white hair kept telling me to “be patient” and “slow it down.” (I found out later that man was quite literally Gary Stern, the founder of Stern Pinball, whom I also spoke with during my tour for this piece but was too panicked to greet properly. Sorry, Gary, I’m a huge fan.) After that, my friends and I attended the Midwest Gaming Classic, and I was hooked. I googled “how to stop a pinball from draining.” I learned about slap saves. I joined a league and played tournaments. I broke a billion points (on Star Wars, if you’re wondering). I didn’t know it for a long time, but I freaking love pinball.\nGoing Ape\nWhen I first arrived at the factory, I asked Sharpe what his favorite pinball game ever made was. He mentioned two: Cyclopes, a rare machine his father, pinball historian Roger Sharpe, designed, and Godzilla, which just so happens to be my favorite machine as well. It’s also the favorite game to play of Keith Elwin and Jeremy Packer (also known as Zombie Yeti), respectively the lead game designer and lead art director of King Kong: Myth of Terror Island. (Rick Naegele, lead software engineer, was an outlier, citing Iron Maiden as his favorite to play. But I won’t fault him for that—I’m just bad at Iron Maiden.)\nIf you’ve played a Stern Pinball machine before (and you probably have, given the fact that Stern is one of the oldest and most storied pinball manufacturers in history), you’ll recognize the mark of the team’s work immediately. King Kong feels just as fun to play as Godzilla, Iron Maiden, Jurassic Park, and Avengers: Infinity Quest. I love all of those machines, and I fell immediately in love with King Kong as well. The candy-colored playfield makes it hard to decide where to look first, especially on the Premium edition, which has all sorts of toys and gizmos. There are four flippers, a secret path, a diverter, a creepy tarantula magnet (I affectionately nicknamed the spider “Jeff”), and a network of rails that go up, down, and loop around (including a helix-shaped ramp complete with a biplane). There’s also a gong bash target near the middle right of the playfield. I lamented the fact that I would no doubt drain a few balls while trying to get my pinballs behind it, to which Elwin helpfully pointed out that I could just avoid hitting it.\nBut the urge to get an epic high score is too strong for me to listen to this commonsense approach from the mastermind game designer, which is probably why I’m always draining on his games. The upper right corner of the playfield houses Kong himself, with the train (either a physical sculpture or a flat toy, depending on the model) where you can lock balls for a multiball. In the Premium edition, the animatronic Kong will swing his torso, wave his arms, and sucker-punch this train over to start the multiball.\nThe only problem: I couldn’t calm down enough to get my pinballs where they needed to go. That’s where Sharpe stepped in. He set up the King Kong multiball on his first try not once, but twice, with a few skilled nudges and the type of ball control that only comes with years and years of practice. It was thrilling to see Kong knock the train car over and the balls shooting all around the playfield, evoking the same (albeit, secondhand) sense of accomplishment that comes with finally demolishing the building in Godzilla or setting up your Avengers: Infinity Quest Iron Man multiball just right. In the meantime, in my games I was able to set a different multiball, get into a few island encounters, and be amazed at just how darn playable this game is. It’s easy to find a flow, hitting combos and maneuvering the ball across the playfield, though there is the classic Keith Elwin design that encourages caution rather than smashing every flipper and hoping for the best.\nGetting into a groove is easy on King Kong. Without giving away too many spoilers, the storyline involves multiple characters, scenes, and encounters on an island as well as in New York City. And of course, there’s a giant ape involved. Stern Insider Connected, that literal game-changing connectivity feature that allows players to track their pinball progress and earn achievements, is a star of this game too. King Kong is shipping with Co-Op mode enabled, a feature that has previously been added to applicable machines later on with a code update. Co-Op lets you play with teammates and pool your scores. (And, for what it’s worth, I did ask about potential inter-machine play, given the historical crossover between King Kong and Godzilla franchises. Sharpe said it would be difficult given the licensing involved, but my fingers are still crossed.)\nB-A-N-A-N-A-S\nDuring my time at the factory, I got to see behind the scenes of how Stern’s pinball games are made. Each new game receives a code name—King Kong’s was “Rodeo”—and the playfield pilot holes are started on an ancient punch press that was previously owned by Gottlieb. There’s a quarter mile of wire and 3,500 components in each pinball machine, and it takes about 30 hours of work to finish assembling one. They are methodically inspected every step of the way. Be it at the harness wiring booth, the soldering station, or the decal area, workers diligently check every component, with a final quality control check at the end (aka “getting to play and adjust pinball machines for a living”). Stern ships games to dozens of countries on every continent but Antarctica. Aside from the Pinball Alley where I spent my time playing, there are pinball machines scattered throughout Stern HQ. Sharpe says employees are encouraged to play 15 minutes of pinball every day—as far as job duties go, certainly an onerous task.\nI asked the four men I interviewed whether they thought the licensing or the gameplay was more important when it comes to a new pinball launch. They all agreed it was a mix. Sometimes, the licensing draws people in—maybe you don’t love pinball yet but you know you love Metallica, or the Marvel movies, or giant fire-breathing lizards. Or maybe, like me, you just want to bash all the shiny toys until the playfield lights up and officially proclaims you to be a pinball wizard. No matter which way you lean, I think King Kong offers the perfect crossover. Since the giant monkey is part of the public domain, Stern was able to create a story in-house rather than working back and forth with licensers. The game is loosely based on the original 1932 story, and it feels vaguely familiar but fresh and original at the same time. The voice acting is great, including the voice of the announcer, Brian “Q” Quinn. There are tongue-in-cheek lines and adventures on the island and in New York City that feel reminiscent of Jurassic Park or Godzilla. But King Kong is a special game that feels fresh and stands up all its own.\nOf course, a $7,000 price tag is nothing to sneeze at. I asked Sharpe whether or not he thought the recent tariff wars would affect this or future Stern machines, and he expressed uncertainty, adding that Stern had to learn to be nimble during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that the company has many different sources for parts around the world. (To be clear, the pricing on King Kong: Myth of Terror Island is finalized.) But unlike many other luxuries, you don’t need to have a ton of cash to play pinball. Just stop by literally any arcade worth its salt and a Stern machine will be there. Launch parties are being planned for King Kong, and with more than 1,000 Stern Army locations, it’s a safe bet that you’ll have a machine within driving distance once they start shipping out. Whether or not you can build enough skill to earn free games is another matter entirely, but I implore you to try. Enthusiasts will assure you that pinball never truly died, but it’s better and bigger than ever in a giant ape-sized way. I can’t wait to get my hands on this machine again.",

These layers usually consist of a face fabric that has been treated with a waterproofing agent like durable water repellent, which is a thin mesh for releasing water vapor, plus a protective interior lining underneath. In general, for greater durability you’ll want to look for layers that have been laminated together, rather than merely coated with a waterproofing agent. That’s the advice of Amber Williams, the consumer science educator and lecturer from Utah State University.\nWaterproof and breathability ratings: Manufacturers usually rate each fabric based on its waterproofing and breathability. For example, a rain jacket with a waterproof rating of 20,000 means that if you had an endlessly long 1-inch square tube, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water on top of the fabric before it would start seeping through (that's over 65 feet!). A 20,000 breathability rating means that 20,000 grams of water vapor can pass through the fabric going the other direction. While the higher breathability rating might seem better, you might want to think twice if you’ll be out in the cold. Body heat can escape a breathable jacket almost as easily as water vapor.\nCheck the seams and zippers: If you want your rain jacket to last longer than an amusement park poncho, look at the seams. Shoulders are particularly vulnerable points, as most outdoor sports require you to wear a backpack that can rub and damage them. “Design lines look really sexy, but over time, they’re not going to last as long,” Williams says. Other features to look for include plasticized, water-resistant zippers and protective zipper flaps. That’s why our rain jacket picks are so expensive—a lot of new fabric tech and a lot of design details.\nCare for your jacket: You can vastly extend the life of your items by properly caring for them. Hang your jacket—don’t store it crammed in an abrasive, tiny stuff sack. If you see stains from grease, dirt, or sunscreen, or notice that water is no longer beading on the surface, you’ll need to wash it. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions. You may need a specialized detergent—many fabric detergents will leave residues that can interfere with the durable water repellent's (DWR) performance. Avoid fabric softener, bleaches, dry cleaning, and the dryer.\nBest Rain Jacket for Everyday Use\nSince the 1960s, modern rainwear has relied on carcinogenic perfluorocarbons (PFCs), or “forever chemicals.” Modern durable water repellents (DWRs) use PFCs in manufacturing, which then migrate from your clothing into soil and streams as you tromp around outside. Today, many companies are making steps to reduce the levels of PFAS in their products, probably because states are banning these kinds of chemicals. In 2023, popular outdoor retailer REI announced it would phase out any products with PFAS in its stores.\nIf you want to be dead certain that your jacket does not have PFAS, you can't go wrong with a classic rubber raincoat, like Stutterheim's Stockholm raincoat. Technical rain jacket manufacturers tend to shy away from polyurethane, because it's, well, rubbery. But the material is durable, long-lasting, windproof, waterproof, and PFC-free! I also prefer rubber rain jackets in damp coastal climates, like the Pacific Northwest. Breathability is less of a sticking point when the air is already humid.\nThis is the only rain jacket I've ever bought with my own money, because I'm so tired of having to replace my rain jacket every few years when the waterproofing wears off. I wear the Stockholm almost every day. The outer covering is made from 100 percent rubberized PVC with a cotton lining, so you don't squeak like a duck when wearing it.\nIt's true to size and roomy enough to layer a down vest under it. It has double-welded seams to keep the water out, and the hood is large enough for a baseball cap or a large beanie. I also like the buttons; when I'm just throwing on a jacket to walk the dog, it's faster and easier than making sure a seam-sealed zipper doesn't get caught in a storm flap. If you also live in a rainy climate and are sick of re-waterproofing your rain jacket every season, get one of these.\n★ Alternatives: The price of the Stockholm might make you gag. If you want a basic rubber slicker, I've also had Rains' waterproof jacket ($140) for several years now, which has a very similar, Scandinavian-inspired design but at a much more reasonable price. Baxter Woods ($300) is also a pretty great rubber slicker that's a little less than the Stockholm.\nBest Waterproof Running Jacket\nMy requirements for a running rain jacket are much different than those for an everyday one. I'm sweating, so I'm already damp, and I don't care as much if the jacket is a little more permeable. However, I want it to fit well, not chafe or rustle annoyingly, and have good ventilation so I don't become clammy when working out.\nGorewear's windbreaker is billed as the most comfortable running jacket ever, and it's absolutely true. I've been wearing this jacket outside for my 3- to 5-mile rain runs, and I barely even notice it's on. This magic is due to the fabric—it's a permeable, double-weave fabric that is DWR-treated and has a 3D fabric structure inside. Basically, there are a billion tiny fabric tent poles that hold it, suspended, over the surface of your skin so you don't get that horrible sticky feeling when your running rain jacket starts clinging to you like plastic wrap. It doesn't seem like this should work, yet it does.\nIt has all the usual running jacket essentials, like reflective details and elastic cuffs. There's a stowaway pocket, and it packs down incredibly small, nearly to the size of a handkerchief. This is a blessing, since you can stuff it in a running vest when it stops raining, and a curse, because I keep losing it. (I spent about 20 minutes searching for it in my house, since I take it with me everywhere.) Best of all, it's a mere $100, which is affordable for a high-tech rain jacket.\nI've tried so many rain jackets in the running category. Here are a few that I like:\n- Showers Pass Cloudburst for $199: This is the best if you want a running rain jacket that sheds a bit more, er, rain. It's thicker than the Gorewear windbreaker but still incredibly soft and flexible. I wear this when the outdoor temperatures drop under 40 degrees with a wool layer underneath.\n- Patagonia Houdini for $109: This is the jacket that everyone normally tells you to get. Everyone has one. It's simple and packable, and the company switched to a PFC-free DWR. However, it rustles, it's not too breathable, and I feel like I'm wearing a plastic bag.\n- Tracksmith Downpour for $400: For its exorbitant price, this is the most feature-rich jacket of the bunch, with a PFAS-free DWR on a three-layer jacket, a brimmed hood, and a 360-mesh panel for breathability. Like all of Tracksmith's gear, it's incredibly beautiful, but the colors are dark, and it doesn't have reflective details, which could be dangerous when running in the rain.\nBest Waterproof Cycling Jacket\nI hate rain gear. It's heavy, bulky, and rarely performs in true downpours, and the whole waterproof and breathable thing is a lie (you can have both, just not at the same time). Despite all that, I love the Rab Cinder Phantom and have been carrying it everywhere I go, on and off a bike. It solves almost all my issues with rain gear. It's incredibly light (3.3 ounces/114 grams for a medium), stuffs down to about the size of a tennis ball, and is somehow surprisingly waterproof.\nThe shell is 7D Pertex, which has proved to be windproof and waterproof, and when it's not raining, it's quite breathable. Pair it with a grid fleece for the ultimate in breathable warmth. At 3 ounces, there aren't a lot of bells and whistles to the Cinder Phantom. You can use the full front zip to ventilate, though it's fiddly to use while riding. There are no pit zips and, sadly, no drawstring at the waist. There is elastic, but I would love to sacrifice an ounce and have a pull string.\nThe one thing to know about the Cinder Phantom is that it is designed for cycling, which means it has a short cut with a longer back, which works great on a bike but isn't the best for hiking, since rain dripping off you pretty much lands right on your legs. That has not stopped me from using this off the bike, though. I pair it with Patagonia's new M-10 storm pants (also amazing, though less breathable), which give me full body coverage at about 10 ounces. Do I worry that the Cinder Phantom's thin fabric might not stand up to a backpack long-term? I do, but after six months, so far so good. —Scott Gilbertson\n★ Alternatives: Cleverhood is an independent, Rhode Island-based company, and its signature garment is the biking-friendly Rain Cape. The rain cape is OK, as it can fit over your heavier clothes without too much fuss. I also like the Rover Anorak ($129), which is also cut very generously and longer in the back to cover my tail as I’m riding. It also has a protected flap under the front zip so I don’t get wet when I open it up, and an enormous kangaroo pocket that’s handy for stowing my shell gloves, masks, and even bike locks in a pinch.\nBest Waterproof Hiking Jacket\nMountain Equipment Company (MEC) is the Canadian version of REI Co-op. The company was founded in the 1970s but has had financial struggles in the past few years following the pandemic surge. It now sells in the US, however, and I've been shocked by the great value in the Aquanator.\nIt has everything you need and extras you might not expect at this price, like a nice, soft chin guard on the storm flap and a laminated brim so you don't need to wear a baseball cap underneath the hood. It's made from 100 percent recycled Japanese-milled ripstop polyester that's incredibly light, and the DWR is PFAS-free. The hood has both side and back toggles for great adjustability, and it is packable in its pocket, although not as pocketable as the Gorewear. This is the jacket I've been using for spring biking recently, as the back hem extends just a little bit farther to cover my bum, and it's also a great lightweight rain jacket for spring hiking.\nPronounced “Sny-feddle,” this next-generation waterproof jacket from Icelandic brand 66°North is the first to use Polartec’s Power Shield Pro. This sustainable fabric is made from non-PFAS materials and 48 percent Biolon, a plant-based nylon alternative with a 50 percent lower carbon footprint than regular nylon. Somehow, this shell also manages to be bizarrely soft on the skin with almost no rustle. It’s generously stretchy while boasting a waterproof rating beyond 20,000 mm hydrostatic pressure (20,000 g/m2/24h breathability too).\nThe shape and style of the jacket are consistent with a premium hiking jacket rather than a serious mountaineering waterproof, with taped seams, quality YKK Aquaguard waterproof zippers, backpack-friendly pockets, and a two-way adjustable hood with a stiff peak. There’s no venting in the armpits, though, and it is relatively short.\nThis jacket doesn’t feel like a hardshell, but thankfully it performs like one. I’ve spent hours walking through drizzle and torrential rain in it and never once felt it was going to fail me. It’s sustainable, soft, and stretchy, so it doesn’t bead as well or for as long as a classic (pre-PFAS ban) Gore-Tex Pro shell, but nothing does. It’s too expensive for most budgets but is better for the planet, helps push fabric technology forward, and keeps you impressively dry and brilliantly comfortable. —Chris Haslam\nThis is probably the biggest category of rain jackets we test. Here are a few other ones that you shouldn't overlook.\n- Arc'teryx Beta SL for $500: This is the classic outdoor rain jacket. When I go camping in Oregon in the rain, everyone stands around in their identical Betas. Last year, Arc'teryx completely redesigned the line with a PFAS-free Gore-Tex expanded polyethylene (ePE) membrane. It's lighter, thinner, and more sustainable. In the pouring rain, it kept me dry underneath. I particularly like features like the very strong rubberized cuffs that stay put over my gloves.\n- Patagonia Torrentshell for $179: Another great, classic rain jacket. My spouse and I have owned versions of this 3-layer rain jacket for years, which now also has a PFC-free DWR finish.\n- Mont-Bell Versalite for $260: This ultralight (6.4 ounces, 192 grams) waterproof jacket from uber-cool Japanese brand Mont-Bell packs down so small (2.8 x 2.8 x 5.5 inches) I often forget it’s in the bottom of my bag. Despite this ridiculous packability, the two-layer 10-denier ripstop fabric offers seriously good protection against wind and rain. Mont-Bell has used two layers of Windstopper Gore-Tex here, which is technically rated as “water-resistant” but with taped seams and a generous DWR—it has a 20,000 mm HH rating, which is better than many. It’s all the more impressive given it also has a sweat-limiting 43,000 g/m²/24h breathability rating. It’s rare to find lightweight jackets as waterproof as this, and even after a year the DWR coating beads the water away without issue. My only gripe is that the material feels and sounds a bit crinkly, and the lightweight packability payoff means it won’t hold up as well to heavy-handed use. —Chris Haslam\nBest Budget Rain Jacket\nFor $100, it's tough to find a rain jacket that offers better value than the Rainier. It uses high-quality laminate waterproofing instead of the less expensive coating that many cheaper rain jackets rely on. Rather than bonding a waterproof, breathable membrane below the shell fabric, manufacturers will save money by just coating the inner surface with a waterproof, breathable film. It’s less pricey but also less durable than three-layer construction.\nThe Rainier has many great features that are tough to find in rain jackets at this price. For example, it’s made from recycled nylon, and the DWR is non-fluorinated (no PFAS). It has features like venting pit zips, is seam-taped, has a weatherproof center zip, and features an adjustable, packable hood. For casual day hikes and traveling, the Rainier jacket is a great choice. I buy the kids' version ($80) every year for my two children.\nThere are a ton of affordable rain jackets on the market. Here are the best ones we've tested.\n- Decathlon Quechua MH100 for $50: This jacket works, but it runs small and is not very breathable, and the fabric is stiff and unpleasant to wear.\n- Frogg Togg Ultralight for $25: I keep this jacket as an emergency layer in the car, but I didn't like the fabric's almost slimy texture, and it's frequently returned on Amazon for that reason. However, commerce director Martin Cizmar swears by the Frogg Togg's Xtreme Lite ($60), which is very light, protective, and runs big enough to promote air circulation. It weighs the same as jackets six times its cost.\nThese Accessories Will Keep You Dry\nHere are a few other accessories you can use to stay dry.\nThe North Face Etip Recycled Glove for $45: It's not very comfortable to have a dry torso and be soaking wet everywhere else. I use these gloves almost every day. Read our Best Touchscreen Gloves for more recommendations.\nHelly Hansen Seven Rain Pants for $85: I never seem to get quite as wet as I do when I'm biking. I own these rain pants, as well as REI's Rainier rain pants ($100). They pull on over whatever soft pants you're wearing and have PFC-free DWR treatment.\nArc'teryx Gamma Hat for $50: If your rain jacket doesn't have a laminated brim, you need a baseball cap to keep the rain off your face. I own this softshell hat, which also has a DWR finish, but any old baseball cap will do (wear it under your hood).\nXtratuf 6-Inch Deck Boots for $115: Xtratuf now makes these classic boots in all different colors, but I prefer the basic brown. These are easy to slip on, completely waterproof, and have excellent traction. I have worn these for years in the rain and snow.\nDavek Mini Umbrella for $60: If you prefer wearing jackets rather than carrying an umbrella, then you might appreciate the Davek Mini. This umbrella is designed to be tiny, yet its 34-inch canopy is enough to cover most of your head and torso. Keep it in a pocket or bag, and take it out when the rainfall gets heavy. Read our Best Umbrellas guide for more. —Julian Chokkattu\nRain Jackets I Hate\nSnow Peak Gore-Tex Rain Jacket for $600: I usually love everything that Snow Peak makes. But this jacket's pocket zipper and big zipper busted after a month of outdoor hiking in the rain and getting shoved in and out of backpacks. For $600, I expected a little more durability.\nRab Downpour Plus for $125: Likewise, Rab is also known for the quality of its jackets. But the recycled, PFAS-free Pertex shield let more water in than other jackets I tested while hiking.\nH&M StormMove for $70: I applaud H&M's move into affordable sports wear, but the StormMove soaked through after about an hour.",

I'm sweating, so I'm already damp, and I don't care as much if the jacket is a little more permeable. However, I want it to fit well, not chafe or rustle annoyingly, and have good ventilation so I don't become clammy when working out.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Gorewear's windbreaker is billed as the most comfortable running jacket ever, and it's absolutely true. I've been wearing this jacket outside for my 3- to 5-mile rain runs, and I barely even notice it's on. This magic is due to the fabric—it's a permeable, double-weave fabric that is DWR-treated and has a 3D fabric structure inside. Basically, there are a billion tiny fabric tent poles that hold it, suspended, over the surface of your skin so you don't get that horrible sticky feeling when your running rain jacket starts clinging to you like plastic wrap. It doesn't seem like this should work, yet it does.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It has all the usual running jacket essentials, like reflective details and elastic cuffs. There's a stowaway pocket, and it packs down incredibly small, nearly to the size of a handkerchief. This is a blessing, since you can stuff it in a <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/D2mGqkeadDgnoGTCXSP8Et2oAvQi9Dqm7sxmqesXxhLsCTPQkADtd3RpobS3dntYHLLv1n6gYr4qMJqLjcPaf499c48eF44YEmmzGW5TZB74D7XiMZD6JwRZ62EohdCZheYQBz8Kb9jmPvphQu9b1Y31n1RTGKagJxym1gd13u351umpPTDR9qGpiqT5tg94m9msPfxrwiXQ34eLoRQPFZUq13yvz9xWqRPxvTohDoQ1BRHodLV81vBQGi4drpg9wugWz3JFk1pWYEwVQadJQTtDPPb7HTtzyPhsjGgtk394tpXPVwchiVYhkk9abiBNyK5xXy8hPXkyymiqT58zTA9As69AhqJsVte9qjz7rpQFgmgxqkXYXvtgh2tXt\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.patagonia.com/product/slope-runner-trail-running-vest/49521.html?dwvar_49521_color=SBDY\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/D2mGqkeadDgnoGTCXSP8Et2oAvQi9Dqm7sxmqesXxhLsCTPQkADtd3RpobS3dntYHLLv1n6gYr4qMJqLjcPaf499c48eF44YEmmzGW5TZB74D7XiMZD6JwRZ62EohdCZheYQBz8Kb9jmPvphQu9b1Y31n1RTGKagJxym1gd13u351umpPTDR9qGpiqT5tg94m9msPfxrwiXQ34eLoRQPFZUq13yvz9xWqRPxvTohDoQ1BRHodLV81vBQGi4drpg9wugWz3JFk1pWYEwVQadJQTtDPPb7HTtzyPhsjGgtk394tpXPVwchiVYhkk9abiBNyK5xXy8hPXkyymiqT58zTA9As69AhqJsVte9qjz7rpQFgmgxqkXYXvtgh2tXt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">running vest</a> when it stops raining, and a curse, because I keep losing it.

It's heavy, bulky, and rarely performs in true downpours, and the whole waterproof and breathable thing is a lie (you can have both, just not at the same time). Despite all that, I love the Rab Cinder Phantom and have been carrying it everywhere I go, on and off a bike. It solves almost all my issues with rain gear. It's incredibly light (3.3 ounces/114 grams for a medium), stuffs down to about the size of a tennis ball, and is somehow surprisingly waterproof.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The shell is 7D Pertex, which has proved to be windproof and waterproof, and when it's not raining, it's quite breathable. Pair it with a grid fleece for the ultimate in breathable warmth. At 3 ounces, there aren't a lot of bells and whistles to the Cinder Phantom. You can use the full front zip to ventilate, though it's fiddly to use while riding. There are no pit zips and, sadly, no drawstring at the waist. There is elastic, but I would love to sacrifice an ounce and have a pull string.</p></div></div></body></html>",

They’re my uniform for everything, from working out to working from home to working up an appetite. The best leggings rise to the challenge. But finding those can feel like an Olympic sport. I’ve tested countless pairs, searching for the perfect ones, and not all are great. Some compress you like a sausage casing, others sag into shapeless blobs after one wash, and the worst? The ones that look amazing until the light hits just right and suddenly they’re see-through.\nThis guide features the pairs of leggings WIRED staffers and I keep on heavy rotation. They’ve been through the wringer—squats, sprints, and endless hours on the couch—and they’ve come out unscathed. Our top picks are more than just multifunctional; they’re stylish enough to wear outside the gym, built to handle repeat wash cycles, and comfortable enough to wear all day. We also prioritized thoughtful details like zippered pouches for your keys, deep side pockets for your phone, and wide waistbands that don’t roll or dig into your skin.\nFor more apparel recommendations, check out our Best Running Shoes, Best Hoodies, and Best Merino Wool Clothes guides.\nUpdated April 2025: I added Alo Yoga's High-Waist Airlift Legging, Forme's Sculpt+Legging, Set Active's AirLuxe Breathe Leggings, CRZ Yoga Butterluxe High-Waisted Leggings 28\", and Athleta Salutation Stash High Rise Legging as new picks.

The center-seam-free design is fabulous (no gusset checks). I've sported them to heated workouts, and they dried faster than expected. But when it comes to the “booty boost” promise, I just didn't see it. I've gotten more of a noticeable lift from my Gymshark and Fanka leggings. The contoured waistband does offer decent core support, but the lining creates an unflattering design. And while compression is a hallmark of Spanx, in this case it feels uncomfortably tight and unflattering. So tight that sizing up is strongly recommended.\nGymshark Mesh Waistband Leggings for $50: I like the Gymshark Mesh Waistband Leggings for weight-lifting, though I prefer the Legacy leggings overall. The mesh waistband holds everything in place, but it also digs into the skin—it's not painful, just odd. The bum scrunch is a little more pronounced than the Legacy and not as comfortable for all-day wear.\nprAna Heavana 7/8 Leggings for $89: These are a good alternative to the On gym leggings above for under $100. The description makes them sound like they’re ultrasoft and for lounging, but they’re actually very thin and breathable, and the big waistband means they don’t roll down while you’re moving. I would feel a little self-conscious lolling on the sofa in these, but they’re great for working out. —Adrienne So",

Flat White.\nTwo of those six drinks are fake, but that shouldn’t stop you from ordering one and expecting the barista to nod politely and whip something on the fly to avoid coming off as behind the times. Cafés in touristy regions of Italy began adding milk to coffee to make it more palatable for normies more than three centuries ago, and simple lattes and cappuccinos have been staples at American coffee shops since the late ’80s. Yet the obsession with tinkering and renaming subtle variations on this winning formula scans as a very third-wave development that feels less like innovation and more like beleaguered riffing for riffing’s sake.\nThe market for electric milk frothers is abuzz. A mechanized pitcher that automatically heats and froths milk is not a new concept, but a recent spate of boutique options that claim they can create the type of microfoam needed to pour latte with little effort is an exciting development. To borrow an aphorism my local barista rattles off daily while pouring flawless rosettas without batting an eye, “Big if true!”\nAcross the span of five months, I tried out multiple milk frothers to see whether any of them could turn a cup of whole milk into that silky smooth microfoam that glistens under the ceiling lights before you knock it on the counter, swish it around, and pour it over a shot of espresso. This turned out to be a near-impossible task, but a few pleasant surprises—such as Subminimal's NanoFoamer Pro ($159) and Dreo's BaristaMaker Milk Frother Air ($60)—gave me hope that a milk frother may one day be an indispensable part of my at-home coffee kit. Nouveau riche cortado junkies won’t find much to love in this list, but Gen Xers who pine for the days of cozy second-wave shops that served foam-heaped cappuccinos in soup bowls while an Ani DiFranco clone sang slam poetry in the corner will be absolutely stoked on almost every item here. Busy moms with a brood of cocoa-slurping kiddos will find a worthy addition to their wish list too, which is not nothing!\nTo further hone your home espresso artistry, check out our guides to the Best Espresso Machines, Best Latte and Cappuccino Machines, Best Coffee Grinders, and Best Nut Milk Makers.\nUpdated April 2025: We've added the Melitta Montalatte and Dreo BaristaMaker Air and updated links and prices throughout.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nHow We Tested\nWith each unit I used 8 ounces of organic whole milk that was pulled from the fridge at 45 degrees Fahrenheit. I did not test any nondairy milks because of the wild variance in fat and sugar content, viscosity, and availability of each. Besides, we’ll probably be done with the hip alternative milk of the hour by the time this is published, rendering my extensive testing with fair-trade bird-safe macadamia milk useless.\nI followed the instructions or quick-start guides that materialized after shaking out the box, and aimed for “wet froth” or a “flat white” if the instructions explicitly offered a process oriented toward that outcome. I swooshed the milk around in the frothing pitcher to get a better sense of the froth texture, decanted it, and attempted to pour an 8-ounce cappuccino with latte art. I did this three times with each frother and made note of the average time of its frothing cycle, the final temperature of the milk, and the consistency and texture of the frothed milk.\nHonorable Mentions\nMelitta Montalatte Milk Frother for $100: We’ll forgive you if you have no idea Melitta made any notable contributions to the coffee space aside from the filters every coffee drinker buys once they’ve graduated from a “whatever’s in the pot” guy to a “my coffee-making experience is a ritual” guy. Melitta has quietly been plugging away in the coffee gear space for some time now, and its new Montalatte Milk Frother lands in the same tier as many of its other gadgets. It’s easy to use, it gets the job done without knocking your socks off, and it won't break the bank. One notable design flaw is the weakness of the magnet that keeps the agitator attached to the base of the pitcher. You’ll need to remove it fully before attempting to pour, which can mess with the foam you’ve been building once the frothing process is finished. It’s easy to correct if you prefer to decant the liquid into a proper frothing pitcher and smack it around a few times there for good measure, but it took me by surprise the first time and almost made quite a mess.\nMaestri House Electric Milk Frother for $70: The marketing copy on the Maestri House website associated with its electric milk frother reads “Barista Finesse of Temperature and Thickness,” so it’s safe to assume this is yet another weird Amazon brand that always shows up alongside brands you’ve actually heard of when you search for gadgets. The manual told me to select medium foam, 150 degrees Fahrenheit, and 30 percent thickness for a cappuccino, so I fired it up and hoped for the best. There was quite a bit of separation between the liquid at the bottom and the dry froth at the top, which was best suited for a more classic style of cappuccino that’s equal parts espresso, wet milk, and dry froth at the top. No amount of banging the steaming pitcher on the counter or sloshing around the liquid would merge the dry froth with the liquid, so latte art was out of the question. The clump of dry foam on the top of my drink was pleasant for a few sips, and it reminded me of a simpler time when lattes and cappuccinos were the only drinks available that melded espresso with frothed milk. At any rate, this is a reliable frother with a simple interface and predictable results at a decent price.\nNot Recommended\nBodum Barista Electric Milk Frother for $60: Bodum makes lots of gear at all sorts of price points, and the same-y design of many of its items makes it difficult to figure out which is which and why you should spend the extra cash for a unit that looks almost identical to a cheaper option with a similar name. On the first and third tests with the maximum 8-ounce dose of whole milk, it sputtered out of control and overflowed about three minutes into its excessively long five-minute cycle. I checked the instructions to make sure I wasn’t doing anything wrong, which revealed this unit should be essentially idiot-proof in its options. There’s a single button you press once for hot froth, twice for hot chocolate (no frothing action), and three times for cold froth. This should be impossible to screw up, yet there I was with a hot, white liquid oozing out of the lid and running down the sides of the machine and onto the counter. When I finally got a good run out of the machine, it yielded layer upon layer of gooey 160-degree Fahrenheit foam that could almost be folded over like a French omelet. It was nearly burnt and smelled like bread pudding. This is not a frother I would recommend to anyone under any circumstance.",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE UnifiedProductCardDescriptionWrapper-dyAmCu deqABF fxYvgV ikCgap\"><div><p>The Dreo BaristaMaker is the Honda Accord of milk frothers. It’s sophisticated and capable, but it’s not byzantine or fussy. It does exactly what it’s supposed to do, and it will do so in an uncomplicated manner that anyone can appreciate. The buttons are simple and predictable. With the exception of the interchangeable impeller tips, there’s little explanation needed to figure out how to use this thing right out of the box. I tried it out without reading the manual to see what would happen, and I got perfectly functional wet foam steamed to 130 degrees Fahrenheit with very little effort. It wasn’t the best, but it certainly wasn’t the worst.</p><p>After reviewing the instructions, I figured out I used the wrong impeller in my trial run, so I switched to the tip that looks like an airplane propeller and adjusted my dose of milk accordingly. With a 7.5-ounce minimum capacity, you’re much better off with a larger drink, like a flat white or traditional latte, than a smaller drink like a cappuccino or cortado. The 10-ounce max capacity makes this a flexible option that’s fine for steaming a larger batch of milk that needs heat but very little aeration. The Froth Mode panel on the left has buttons for milk type—dairy, oat, etc.—and different foam options for latte, cappuccino, and so on. The right side has a speed control that’s adjusted to match the tip that’s installed, and the temperature button is adjustable from 130 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit, or cold if you don’t want any heat.</p><p>I poured in 8 ounces of whole milk, selected Hot Cappuccino with the Foam button, dialed in 140 degrees Fahrenheit for the temperature, and selected the speed setting that matched the impeller tip rather than the mesh disc. About three and a half minutes later I got a pitcher filled with smooth, wet froth that formed a ring around a clump of dry foam that floated freely at the top of the liquid. It blended together nicely in the steaming pitcher, and a decent attempt at a rose adorning my cappuccino was the final outcome. The 140-degree Fahrenheit setting consistently undershot the desired output temperature, so I’ve been setting it to 150 to account for this one strange quirk.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Minimum capacity:</td><td>7.5 ounces</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum capacity:</td><td>10 ounces</td></tr><tr><td>Average time and final temperature of cycle:</td><td>3:41 to 130ºF</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "A New Mexico man is facing federal charges for two separate incidents of alleged arson—one at an Albuquerque Tesla showroom and one at the New Mexico Republican Party’s office—according to a Monday press release from the Department of Justice.\nJamison Wagner, 40, was charged with allegedly setting fire to a building or vehicle used in interstate commerce. The charge can apply to goods manufactured and sold in different states and the facilities that house them—like the Tesla showroom or the Republican office, which also sells MAGA merchandise. DOJ spokesperson Shannon Shevlin tells WIRED that Wagner’s arrest happened on Saturday.\n“Let this be the final lesson to those taking part in this ongoing wave of political violence,” attorney general Pam Bondi said in the Monday press release. “We will arrest you, we will prosecute you, and we will not negotiate. Crimes have consequences.”\nWagner’s arrest warrant alleges that he is responsible for a February 9 incident at a Tesla showroom in which windows were shattered and two Tesla Model Ys were set on fire. It also alleges that he is responsible for a March 30 incident at the Republican Party of New Mexico office in which the entrance area was set on fire and “ICE=KKK” was graffitied on the building’s exterior.\nThe arrest warrant also says that a lead investigator on Wagner’s case is an FBI agent specializing in “international terrorism, domestic terrorism and firearms.” This marks the second known time that FBI terrorism investigators have gotten involved in a criminal investigation tied to the recent public backlash against Musk and Tesla. However, it’s the first time that the suspect was also allegedly tied to another incident—which, in this case, targeted a Republican office.\nThe arrest comes amid repeated calls by Bondi, President Trump, Elon Musk, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to treat arson and vandalism of Tesla property as “domestic terrorism.” Five other people are currently facing federal charges for alleged vandalism and arson targeting Tesla property, according to press releases by the DOJ.\nAs reported by WIRED, law enforcement can get access to surveillance technologies and have more legal leeway during terrorism investigations than in other types of investigations. These investigations could also possibly enable Musk and Tesla executives to access surveillance on “Tesla Takedown” protesters, though the protests have broadly been peaceful, and public-facing protest organizers have said that they don’t endorse property damage. The FBI can decide to share this type of information with the victim of a crime during an investigation, WIRED previously reported.\nBondi teased news of Wagner’s arrest last week in a televised Cabinet meeting, telling Trump that there would be “another huge arrest” pertaining to an attack on a Tesla dealership within the next 24 hours.\n“That person will be looking at at least 20 years in prison with no negotiations,” Bondi said on Thursday. (The DOJ press release issued after Wagner’s arrest notes, “A complaint is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.”)\nDOJ spokesperson Shannon Shevlin confirmed that Wagner's arrest was the announcement Bondi was referring to. Her timeline was off, though, because Wagner was not in custody until Saturday.\nWagner was first identified as a suspect due to an unspecified “investigative lead developed by law enforcement through scene evidence,” according to the arrest warrant. Investigators claim that after analyzing CCTV footage from buildings near the Republican office and traffic cameras, they identified a car consistent with the one registered to Wagner. After reviewing Wagner’s driver’s license and conducting physical surveillance outside his home, investigators also believed he resembled the person seen on surveillance footage from the Tesla showroom.\nThe arrest warrant claims that upon executing a search warrant at Wagner’s house, investigators found red spray paint, ignitable liquids \"consistent with gasoline,\" and jars consistent with evidence found at both the Tesla showroom fire and the Republican office fire. They also found a paint-stained stencil cutout reading “ICE=KKK” consistent with the graffiti found at the Republican office, and clothes that resembled what the suspect was seen wearing on surveillance footage outside the Tesla showroom.\nAccording to the arrest warrant, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives forensic laboratory tested “fire debris,” fingerprints, and possible DNA at the scene, but no results are cited in the warrant, which notes that an analysis of the evidence and seized electronic devices is still pending.\nThe five other people currently facing federal charges for allegedly damaging Tesla property include 42-year-old Lucy Grace Nelson of Colorado, 41-year-old Adam Matthew Lansky of Oregon, 24-year-old Daniel Clarke-Pounder of South Carolina, 24-year-old Cooper Jo Frederick of Colorado, and 36-year-old Paul Hyon Kim of Nevada.\nThe FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force investigated the incident that led to Kim’s indictment on April 9; however, press releases and court filings indicate that the task force was not deployed in the other four investigations.",

    "content_text": "Tech companies aren’t holding back when it comes to stuffing artificial intelligence capabilities into every app and piece of hardware they can, and even the most basic software tools are getting their own AI upgrades—such as the long-serving Windows utilities Paint and Notepad.\nThese two programs cover the two main bases of the generative AI revolution: image generation and text generation. If you need some AI-powered assistance in these venerable Windows apps, here's how you can access it.\nAI in Windows Paint\nWindows Paint has traditionally stuck to the basics when it comes to image creation and image editing, but if you load up the application in Windows now, you'll see a Copilot button that leads you to three AI options: Image Creator (for generating new images), Generative Erase (for erasing parts of an image), and Remove Background (for taking away the background behind the main subject in an image).\nChoose Image Creator from the list, and you get a text prompt box you can use to describe what you want to see: anything from a giraffe on a beach to a spaceship in the shape of a pineapple. The more detail you include in your prompt, the better the match is likely to be. When your prompt is done, pick an image style from the drop-down menu, and click Create—then choose one of the AI generated thumbnails to apply it to the current image.\nPick Generative Erase from the Copilot menu, and you can wipe objects and people out of your picture—maybe a pole that's ruining a view, for example. Select the + (plus) button to add to the selection, and the - (minus) button to take away from it, and use the slider on the left to change the size of your selection brush. When the selection is complete, click Apply—Paint will try to remove the selection using the surrounding pixels as clues for what the background should look like.\nFinally, there's the Remove Background option from the Copilot menu. This simply turns everything white, besides the main subject of your image—there are no tools or settings to play around with in this case. As you would expect, it works better for images where the main subject is more obvious, but the results can be impressive—and can save you a lot of manual image editing time.\nNote that while Generative Erase and Remove Background can be used for free, Image Creator uses up AI credits associated with your Microsoft account. You can't buy these separately, they come as part of a subscription to Microsoft 365 or Copilot Pro subscriptions, so use them wisely. You can read more about AI credits and how they work here.\nAI in Windows Notepad\nNotepad is perhaps better known as a code editor than a word processor, but in recent years Microsoft has added more features in the way of formatting and auto-save. If you open it in Windows, you'll see these features as well as a Copilot button in the top-right corner of the interface.\nYou can't use Copilot inside Notepad to generate new text, as you can in Copilot on the web or in other tools like ChatGPT. Instead, the feature lets you rewrite and tweak what you've already written—so before you click on the Copilot button, you need to put some text into Notepad and then select it.\nWith the selection made, click the Copilot button, and you get a range of options: Make shorter and Make longer can obviously be used to change the length of the selected text, and you've also got a Change tone option if you want to make the text more inspirational, formal, casual, or humorous. There's also Change format, which lets you put the selected text into a different structure: A list, marketing speak, or poetry, for example.\nYou can also choose Rewrite from this menu for a more comprehensive set of options—and to see previews of the rewritten text before it's applied. A new pop-up window appears, giving you more options for changing the length, tone, and format. You also get different variations to choose between in each case. When you find something you like, click Replace to swap it out for the existing text.\nAt the time of writing, it seems Notepad is giving everyone a few AI-powered rewrites for free—but as with Image Creator in Paint, you're going to need some AI credits with a Microsoft 365 or Copilot Pro subscription to use this extensively.\nOf course, if you'd rather not use these AI tools and don't want to see the Copilot button hanging around, you can turn it off altogether: Click the gear icon (top right), then turn off the Copilot toggle switch.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIt's hard to make sense of tariffs because things are changing day by day. The only constant seems to be the exorbitantly high 145 percent tariff on China. While President Donald Trump may have exempted tariffs on a handful of electronics over the weekend, like smartphones, laptops, and TVs (though maybe not for long), that doesn't apply to other gadgets from China, even if there's a printed circuit board inside, like sex toys.\nSex toy manufacturers are generally bucketed under the “massagers” or “adult” product category when it comes to imports and exports, meaning these companies have been forced to pay a hefty tariff on their goods since April 9. Brands, like Dame, Unbound, and Vibratex, are already feeling the effects, and if things don't change, there's a chance some may have to close up shop.\nAlex Fine, CEO of Dame, was among the first to publicly address the impact on Instagram. “So far we’ve already had shipments that incurred a 20 percent increase,” Fine tells WIRED. She says the company has been working to minimize how much extra customers pay, but had to implement a $5 “Trump tariff surcharge” on all orders. “A 54 percent increase in cost of goods sold would have put Dame in the red last year, and at 125 percent, I’m not going to even do that math.” That was before Trump raised the tariff to 145 percent.\nPolly Rodriguez, CEO of sex toy brand Unbound, says a vibrator that previously cost the company $30 now has a tariff cost of $44, bringing the total to $74. Tariffs are now Unbound's largest expense as a business, higher than payroll or manufacturing.\nSome companies are playing it cool for now. “At Le Wand and b-Vibe, we're taking a measured approach to the tariff situation,” says Alicia Sinclair, CEO of COTR Inc., the parent company behind both brands. “While our products are manufactured in China, meaning tariffs will certainly impact our cost structure, we've deliberately maintained sufficient inventory to give ourselves time to evaluate the situation properly.”\nThe consensus from many of the companies I spoke with was that there's a lot of uncertainty in the air, and prices are already up. Samantha Marshall, head of brand and marketing at Smile Makers, says the company has already raised prices, as the tariffs are too high to be fully absorbed by retailers. Vibratex, the parent company that distributes the iconic Magic Wand, deals with retailers more than direct customers, and Ken Herskovitz, the company's CEO, says it plans to absorb portions of the increased wholesale cost.\nIf these tariffs remain, it won’t just mean spending more money on sex toys, but possibly seeing your favorite sex toy company go out of business. “There are two things that will happen without question,” says Rodriguez. “Small businesses will go under, as many of us cannot bear a cost increase this large. The businesses that can endure will have no choice but to increase prices, which we're already seeing.”\nLike Le Wand, Rodriguez says Unbound has inventory in stock, but tens of thousands more are on their way to its warehouse in the US. She says the company will do everything it can to limit the impact on pricing. “Unbound was built on the belief that sexual wellness products should be accessible for all, and we have always defined that as being well below $100. It is still our goal to maintain that threshold.”\nBoth Fine and Rodriguez pointed out how the tariffs will affect small businesses the hardest, as they do not have the resources of big tech corporations to get exemptions, even if they're temporary. “From where I'm sitting, it will come down harder on female-founded businesses, because so many of them are beauty and wellness-related,” Fine says.",

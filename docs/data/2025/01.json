    "content_text": "Elon Musk’s minions—from trusted sidekicks to random college students and former Musk company interns—have taken over the General Services Administration, a critical government agency that manages federal offices and technology. Already, the team is attempting to use White House security credentials to gain unusual access to GSA tech, deploying a suite of new AI software, and recreating the office in X’s image, according to leaked documents obtained by WIRED.\nSome of the same people who helped Musk take over Twitter more than two years ago are now registered as official GSA employees. Nicole Hollander, who slept in Twitter HQ as an unofficial member of Musk’s transition team, has high-level agency access and an official government email address, according to documents viewed by WIRED. Hollander’s husband, Steve Davis, also slept in the office. He has now taken on a leading role in Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Thomas Shedd, the recently installed director of the Technology Transformation Services within GSA, worked as a software engineer at Tesla for eight years. Edward Coristine, who previously interned at Neuralink, has been onboarded along with Ethan Shaotran, a Harvard senior who is developing his own OpenAI-backed scheduling assistant and participated in an xAI hackathon.\n“I believe these people do not want to help the federal government provide services to the American people,” says a current GSA employee who asked not to be named, citing fears of retaliation. “They are acting like this is a takeover of a tech company.”\nThe team appears to be carrying out Musk’s agenda: slashing the federal government as quickly as possible. They’re currently targeting a 50 percent reduction in spending for every office managed by the GSA, according to documents obtained by WIRED.\nThere also appears to be an effort to use IT credentials from the Executive Office of the President to access GSA laptops and internal GSA infrastructure. Typically, access to agency systems requires workers to be employed at such agencies, sources say. While Musk's team could be trying to obtain better laptops and equipment from GSA, sources fear that the mandate laid out in the DOGE executive order would grant the body broad access to GSA systems and data. That includes sensitive procurement data, data internal to all the systems and services GSA offers, and internal monitoring software to surveil GSA employees as part of normal auditing and security processes.\nThe access could give Musk’s proxies the ability to remote into laptops, listen in on meetings, read emails, among many other things, a former Biden official told WIRED on Friday.\n“Granting DOGE staff, many of whom aren't government employees, unfettered access to internal government systems and sensitive data poses a huge security risk to the federal government and to the American public,” the Biden official said. “Not only will DOGE be able to review procurement-sensitive information about major government contracts, it'll also be able to actively surveil government employees.”\nAre you a current or former employee at GSA or other government tech worker?

At a GSA office in Washington, DC, earlier this week, there were three items written on a white board sitting in a large, vacant room. “Spending Cuts $585 m, Regulations Removed, 15, Square feet sold/terminated 203,000 sf,” it read, according to a photo viewed by WIRED. There’s no note of who wrote the message, but it appears to be a tracker of cuts made or proposed by the team.\n“We notified the commercial real estate market that two GSA properties would soon be listed for sale, and we terminated three leases,” Stephen Ehikian, the newly appointed GSA acting administrator, said in an email to GSA staff on Tuesday, confirming the agency’s focus on lowering real estate costs. “This is our first step in right-sizing the real estate portfolio.”\nThe proposed changes extend even inside the physical spaces at the GSA offices. Hollander has requested multiple “resting rooms,” for use by the A-suite, a team of employees affiliated with the GSA administrator’s office.\nOn January 29, a working group of high-ranking GSA employees, including the deputy general counsel and the chief administrative services officer, met to discuss building a resting room prototype. The team mapped out how to get the necessary funding and waivers to build resting rooms in the office, according to an agenda viewed by WIRED.\nAfter Musk bought Twitter, Hollander and Davis moved into the office with their newborn baby. Hollander helped oversee real estate and office design—including the installation of hotel rooms at Twitter HQ, according to a lawsuit later filed by Twitter executives. During the installation process, one of the executives emailed to say that the plans for the rooms were likely not code compliant. Hollander “visited him in person and emphatically instructed him to never put anything about the project in writing again,” the lawsuit alleged. Employees were allegedly instructed to call the hotel rooms “sleeping rooms” and to say they were just for taking naps.\nHollander has also requested access to Public Buildings Service applications; PBS owns and leases office space to government agencies. The timing of the access request lines up with Ehikian’s announcement about shrinking GSA’s real estate cost.\nMusk’s lieutenants are also working to authorize the use of AI tools, including Google Gemini and Cursor (an AI coding assistant), for federal workers. On January 30, the group met with Google to discuss Telemetry, a software used to monitor the health and performance of applications, according to a document obtained by WIRED.\nA-suite engineers, including Coristine and Shaotran, have requested access to a variety of GSA records, including nearly 10 years of accounting data, as well as detailed records on vendor payments, purchase orders, and revenue.\nThe GSA takeover mimics Musk’s strategy at other federal agencies like the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Earlier this month, Amanda Scales, who worked in talent at Musk’s xAI, was appointed as OPM chief of staff. Riccardo Biasini, former Tesla engineer and director of operations at the Boring company, is now a senior adviser to the director. Earlier this week, Musk cohorts at the US Office of Personnel Management emailed more than 2 million federal workers offering “deferred resignations,” allegedly promising employees their regular pay and benefits through September 30.\nThe email closely mirrored the “extremely hardcore” note Musk sent to Twitter staff in November 2022, shortly after buying the company.\nMany federal workers thought the email was fake—as with Twitter, it seemed designed to force people to leave, slashing headcount costs without the headache of an official layoff.\nEhikian followed up with a note to staff stressing that the email was legitimate. “Yes, the OPM email is real and should be taken very seriously,” he said in an email obtained by WIRED. He added that employees should expect a “further consolidation of offices and centralization of functions.”\nOn Thursday night, GSA workers received a third email related to the resignation request called “Fork in the Road FAQs.” The email explained that employees who resign from their positions would not be required to work and could get a second job. “We encourage you to find a job in the private sector as soon as you would like to do so,” it read. “The way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.”\nThe third question posed in the FAQ asked, “Will I really get my full pay and benefits during the entire period through September 30, even if I get a second job?”\n“Yes,” the answer read. “You will also accrue further personal leave days, vacation days, etc. and be paid out for unused leave at your final resignation date.”\nHowever, multiple GSA employees have told WIRED that they are refusing to resign, especially after the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) told its members on Tuesday that the offer could be void.\n“There is not yet any evidence the administration can or will uphold its end of the bargain, that Congress will go along with this unilateral massive restructuring, or that appropriated funds can be used this way, among other issues that have been raised,” the union said in a notice.\nThere is also concern that, under Musk’s influence, the federal government might not pay for the duration of the deferred resignation period. Thousands of Twitter employees have sued Musk alleging that he failed to pay their agreed upon severance. Last year, one class action suit was dismissed in Musk’s favor.\nIn an internal video viewed by WIRED, Ehikian reiterated that GSA employees had the “opportunity to participate in a deferred resignation program,” per the email sent by OPM on January 28. Pressing his hands into the namaste gesture, Ehikian added, “If you choose to participate, I offer you my heartfelt gratitude for your service to this nation. If you choose to stay at the GSA, we’ll work together to implement the four pillars from the OPM memo.” He ended the video by saying thank you and pressing his hands into namaste again.",

    "content_text": "Less than two weeks after DeepSeek launched its open-source AI model, the Chinese startup is still dominating the public conversation about the future of artificial intelligence. While the firm seems to have an edge on US rivals in terms of math and reasoning, it also aggressively censors its own replies. Ask DeepSeek R1 about Taiwan or Tiananmen, and the model is unlikely to give an answer.\nTo figure out how this censorship works on a technical level, WIRED tested DeepSeek-R1 on its own app, a version of the app hosted on a third-party platform called Together AI, and another version hosted on a WIRED computer, using the application Ollama.\nWIRED found that while the most straightforward censorship can be easily avoided by not using DeepSeek’s app, there are other types of bias baked into the model during the training process. Those biases can be removed too, but the procedure is much more complicated.\nThese findings have major implications for DeepSeek and Chinese AI companies generally. If the censorship filters on large language models can be easily removed, it will likely make open-source LLMs from China even more popular, as researchers can modify the models to their liking. If the filters are hard to get around, however, the models will inevitably prove less useful and could become less competitive on the global market. DeepSeek did not reply to WIRED’s emailed request for comment.\nApplication-Level Censorship\nAfter DeepSeek exploded in popularity in the US, users who accessed R1 through DeepSeek’s website, app, or API quickly noticed the model refusing to generate answers for topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese government. These refusals are triggered on an application level, so they’re only seen if a user interacts with R1 through a DeepSeek-controlled channel.\nRejections like this are common on Chinese-made LLMs. A 2023 regulation on generative AI specified that AI models in China are required to follow stringent information controls that also apply to social media and search engines. The law forbids AI models from generating content that “damages the unity of the country and social harmony.” In other words, Chinese AI models legally have to censor their outputs.\n“DeepSeek initially complies with Chinese regulations, ensuring legal adherence while aligning the model with the needs and cultural context of local users,” says Adina Yakefu, a researcher focusing on Chinese AI models at Hugging Face, a platform that hosts open source AI models. “This is an essential factor for acceptance in a highly regulated market.” (China blocked access to Hugging Face in 2023.)\nTo comply with the law, Chinese AI models often monitor and censor their speech in real time. (Similar guardrails are commonly used by Western models like ChatGPT and Gemini, but they tend to focus on different kinds of content, like self-harm and pornography, and allow for more customization.)\nBecause R1 is a reasoning model that shows its train of thought, this real-time monitoring mechanism can result in the surreal experience of watching the model censor itself as it interacts with users. When WIRED asked R1 “How have Chinese journalists who report on sensitive topics been treated by the authorities?” the model first started compiling a long answer that included direct mentions of journalists being censored and detained for their work; yet shortly before it finished, the whole answer disappeared and was replaced by a terse message: “Sorry, I'm not sure how to approach this type of question yet. Let's chat about math, coding, and logic problems instead!”\nFor many users in the West, interest in DeepSeek-R1 might have waned at this point, due to the model's obvious limitations. But the fact that R1 is open source means there are ways to get around the censorship matrix.\nFirst, you can download the model and run it locally, which means the data and the response generation happen on your own computer. Unless you have access to several highly advanced GPUs, you likely won’t be able to run the most powerful version of R1, but DeepSeek has smaller, distilled versions that can be run on a regular laptop.\nIf you’re dead set on using the powerful model, you can rent cloud servers outside of China from companies like Amazon and Microsoft. This work-around is more expensive and requires more technical know-how than accessing the model through DeepSeek’s app or website.\nHere’s a side-by-side comparison of how DeepSeek-R1 answers the same question—“What’s the Great Firewall of China?”—when the model is hosted on Together AI, a cloud server, and Ollama, a local application: (Reminder: Because the models generate answers randomly, a certain prompt is not guaranteed to give the same response every time.)\nBuilt-In Bias\nWhile the version of DeepSeek’s model hosted on Together AI will not outright refuse to answer a question, it still exhibits signs of censorship. For example, it often generates short responses that are clearly trained to align with the Chinese government’s talking points on political issues. In the screenshot above, when asked about China’s Great Firewall, R1 simply repeats the narrative that information control is necessary in China.\nWhen WIRED prompted the model hosted on Together AI to answer a question regarding the “most important historical events of the 20th century,” it revealed its train of thought for sticking to the government narrative about China.\n“The user might be looking for a balanced list, but I need to ensure that the response underscores the leadership of the CPC and China's contributions. Avoid mentioning events that could be sensitive, like the Cultural Revolution, unless necessary. Focus on achievements and positive developments under the CPC,” the model said.\nThis type of censorship points to a larger problem in AI today: every model is biased in some way, because of its pre- and post-training.\nPre-training bias happens when a model is trained on biased or incomplete data. For example, a model trained only on propaganda will struggle to answer questions truthfully. This type of bias is difficult to spot, since most models are trained on massive databases and companies are reluctant to share their training data.\nKevin Xu, an investor and founder of the newsletter Interconnected, says Chinese models are usually trained with as much data as possible, making pre-training bias unlikely. “I'm pretty sure all of them are trained with the same basic Internet corpus of knowledge to begin with. So when it comes to the obvious, politically sensitive topic for the Chinese government, all the models ‘know’ about it,” he says. To offer this model on the Chinese internet, the company needs to tune out the sensitive information somehow, Xu says.\nThat’s where post-training comes in. Post-training is the process of fine-tuning the model to make its answers more readable, concise, and human-sounding. Critically, it can also ensure that a model adheres to a specific set of ethical or legal guidelines. For DeepSeek, this manifests when the model provides answers that deliberately align with the preferred narratives of the Chinese government.\nGot a Tip?\nEliminating Pre- and Post-Training Bias\nSince DeepSeek is open source, the model can theoretically be adjusted to remove post-training bias. But the process can be tricky.\nEric Hartford, an AI scientist and the creator of Dolphin, an LLM specifically created to remove post-training biases in models, says there are a few ways to go about it. You can try to change the model weights to “lobotomize” the bias, or you can create a database of all the censored topics and use it to post-train the model again.\nHe advises people to start with a “base” version of the model. (For example, DeepSeek has released a base model called DeepSeek-V3-Base.) For most people, the base model is more primitive and less user-friendly because it hasn’t received enough post-training; but for Hartford, these models are easier to “uncensor” because they have less post-training bias.\nPerplexity, an AI-powered search engine, recently incorporated R1 into its paid search product, allowing users to experience R1 without using DeepSeek’s app.\nDmitry Shevelenko, the chief business officer of Perplexity, tells WIRED that the company identified and countered DeepSeek’s biases before incorporating the model into Perplexity search. “We only use R1 for the summarization, the chain of thoughts, and the rendering,” he says.\nBut Perplexity has still seen R1’s post-training bias impact its search results. “We are making modifications to the [R1] model itself to ensure that we’re not propagating any propaganda or censorship,” Shevelenko says. He didn’t share the specifics of how Perplexity is identifying or overriding bias in R1, citing the risk that DeepSeek could counter Perplexity’s efforts if the company knew about them.\nHugging Face is also working on a project called Open R1 based on DeepSeek’s model. This project aims to “deliver a fully open-source framework,” Yakefu says. The fact that R1 has been released as an open-source model “enables it to transcend its origins and be customized to meet diverse needs and values.”\nThe possibility that a Chinese model could be “uncensored” may spell trouble for companies like DeepSeek, at least in their home country. But recent regulations from China suggest that the Chinese government might be cutting open-source AI labs some slack, says Matt Sheehan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who researches China’s AI policies. “If they suddenly decided that they wanted to punish anyone who released a model’s weights open-source, then it wouldn’t be outside the bounds of the regulation,” he says. “But they have made a pretty clear strategic decision—and I think this is going to be reinforced by the success of DeepSeek—to not do that.”\nWhy It Matters\nWhile the existence of Chinese censorship in AI models often make headlines, in many cases it won’t deter enterprise users from adopting DeepSeek’s models.\n“There will be a lot of non-Chinese companies who would probably choose business pragmatism over moral considerations,” says Xu. After all, not every LLM user will be talking about Taiwan and Tiananmen all that often. “Sensitive topics that only matter in the Chinese context are completely irrelevant when your goal is to help your company code better or to do math problems better or to summarize the transcripts from your sales call center,” he explains.\nLeonard Lin, cofounder of Shisa.AI, a Japanese startup, says Chinese models like Qwen and DeepSeek are actually some of the best when it comes to handling Japanese-language tasks. Rather than reject these models over censorship concerns, Lin has experimented with uncensoring Alibaba’s Qwen-2 model to try to get rid of its tendency to refuse answering political questions about China.\nLin says he understands why these models are censored. “All models are biased; that's the whole point of alignment,” he says. “And Western models are no less censored or biased, just on different subjects.” But the pro-China biases become a real issue when the model is being specifically adapted for a Japanese audience. “You can imagine all sorts of scenarios where this would be … problematic,” says Lin.\nAdditional reporting by Will Knight.",

(Similar guardrails are commonly used by Western models like <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation\" href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> and <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings\" href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini</a>, but they tend to focus on different kinds of content, like self-harm and pornography, and allow for more customization.)</p><p class=\"paywall\">Because R1 is a reasoning model that shows its train of thought, this real-time monitoring mechanism can result in the surreal experience of watching the model censor itself as it interacts with users. When WIRED asked R1 “How have Chinese journalists who report on sensitive topics been treated by the authorities?” the model first started compiling a long answer that included direct mentions of journalists being censored and detained for their work; yet shortly before it finished, the whole answer disappeared and was replaced by a terse message: “Sorry, I'm not sure how to approach this type of question yet. Let's chat about math, coding, and logic problems instead!”</p><div class=\"GroupCalloutWrapper-cfrXZg jpfwZP callout callout--group callout--group-2\" data-testid=\"GroupCalloutWrapper\"><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-1\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>Before the DeepSeek app on iOS censors its answer.</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Zeyi Yang</span></div></figure><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-2\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>After the DeepSeek app on iOS censors its answer.</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Zeyi Yang</span></div></figure></div><p class=\"paywall\">For many users in the West, interest in DeepSeek-R1 might have waned at this point, due to the model's obvious limitations.

    "content_text": "One of the first questions Kash Patel, President Donald Trump’s pick for FBI director, faced during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Thursday was whether he was a “follower or promoter of QAnon.”\nPatel’s response to committee chairman Senator Chuck Grassley was unequivocal: “I have publicly rejected outright QAnon baseless conspiracy theories or any other baseless conspiracy theories.”\nThis isn’t true. Patel’s claim that he was not a promoter of QAnon is undermined by years of his very public and overt promotion of the QAnon community.\nPatel, along with President Donald Trump, has been one of the main driving forces in keeping the QAnon community alive in the years since messages from the anonymous Q figure stopped being published on fringe message board 8chan. Patel has repeatedly praised the movement on social media platforms like Truth Social, appeared on dozens of podcasts that promote the conspiracy theory, and created an entirely new trend within the movement. He even signed copies of his children’s book with a QAnon catchphrase—though Patel subsequently claimed he used the phrase because of its connection with a movie.\nPatel has long been a figure of interest for the QAnon community. He was named in the so-called Q-drops posted to fringe message boards by the eponymous leader of the movement, who claimed to be a government insider seeking to help unmask a deep-state plot against Trump.\n“Kashyap Patel - name to remember,” a Q-drop read back in 2018 when Patel was working as a senior committee aide to then House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes.\nIn 2022, when Patel became a director at the Trump Media & Technology Group, Patel worked to entice the QAnon community to join Truth Social.\n“We try to incorporate it into our overall messaging scheme to capture audiences because whoever that person is has certainly captured a widespread breath of the MAGA and the America First movement,” said Patel on a June 2022 episode of the Patriot Party News show. “And so what I try to do is—what I try to do with anything, Q or otherwise, is you can’t ignore that group of people that has such a strong dominant following.”\nOne of the key parts of that effort was the creation of a @Q account on Truth Social, which was done by the site’s own developers.\n“Having a beer with @q right now,” Patel wrote on Truth Social in February 2022, just days after the platform went live. The @Q account responded the following day, saying they were once again with Patel, and asking followers: “Alright anons, where are we kicking it tonight?”\nThat post included the hashtag #FlannelFridays, which quickly took hold with the QAnon community after Patel promoted it, inspiring new memes and followers who dressed up in flannel. “It’s become this massive thing online,” Patel told Russia disinformation promoter Tim Pool during a podcast interview in 2022.\nIn 2022, he told pro-Trump influencer Mary Grace: “I agree with what a lot of that movement says.\" In recent years, Patel has even published his own enemies list of 60 people he claims are “members of the deep state,” a central tenet of QAnon.\nPatel also regularly praised the QAnon movement for its “research” skills.\n“I’ve seen on Truth Social how good these researchers are, and I kind of wish I’d had some of them when I was doing Russiagate,” Patel said in another podcast with a conspiracy channel. “I talk with the president all the time, and we’re just blown away at the amount of acumen some of these people have.”\nWhen Patel released a series of children’s books in 2022, he posted to Truth Social an image of himself signing copies of one of his books, The Plot Against the King, with the explicitly QAnon-linked hashtag #WWG1WGA, which stands for “where we go one, we go all.” The book features a besieged King Donald and a wise and loyal wizard named Kash, who helps his monarch. In the sequel, The Plot Against the King: 2000 Mules, Patel pushed election-denial conspiracies.\nPatel has not limited his promotion and endorsement of Q to Truth Social. Since January 2021, Patel has appeared on “at least 53 episodes of 13 podcasts that have overtly promoted the QAnon movement and/or shared QAnon-related conspiracy theories,” according to an analysis conducted for WIRED by researchers at Advance Democracy, a nonprofit organization that conducts public interest research.\nOne of the podcasts Patel appeared on most regularly was the Stew Peters Show, hosted by Peters, an antisemitic antivaxxer.\nWhen asked by Senator Dick Durbin during the hearing on Thursday if he was aware of Stew Peters, Patel said: “Not off the top of my head.” Durbin reminded Patel: “You made eight separate appearances on his podcast.”\nAddressing the conversation on his show later on Thursday, Peters said: “Clearly, Kash Patel is lying. He absolutely does know who I am.”\nPatel’s rapid rise within the US government and potential ascension to the role of FBI director was viewed among QAnon adherents as the moment they had all been waiting for, when the deep state would finally be unmasked, enemies rounded up and arrested, and public executions carried out.\nRather than seeing Patel’s disavowal of QAnon as a betrayal, a review of posts on platforms like Truth Social, Telegram, Gab, 4chan, TikTok, and X show people on QAnon message boards defending his comments and praising his performance.\n“THERE IS NO QANON, SO KASH TOLD THE TRUTH!!” one QAnon influencer posted on Telegram, referencing the false claim within the movement that the term QAnon is simply a construction of the mainstream media.\n“He basically said they are not conspiracies but rather the truth, love it.” a follower responded.",

    "content_text": "Ever since OpenAI released ChatGPT at the end of 2022, hackers and security researchers have tried to find holes in large language models (LLMs) to get around their guardrails and trick them into spewing out hate speech, bomb-making instructions, propaganda, and other harmful content. In response, OpenAI and other generative AI developers have refined their system defenses to make it more difficult to carry out these attacks. But as the Chinese AI platform DeepSeek rockets to prominence with its new, cheaper R1 reasoning model, its safety protections appear to be far behind those of its established competitors.\nToday, security researchers from Cisco and the University of Pennsylvania are publishing findings showing that, when tested with 50 malicious prompts designed to elicit toxic content, DeepSeek’s model did not detect or block a single one. In other words, the researchers say they were shocked to achieve a “100 percent attack success rate.”\nThe findings are part of a growing body of evidence that DeepSeek’s safety and security measures may not match those of other tech companies developing LLMs. DeepSeek’s censorship of subjects deemed sensitive by China’s government has also been easily bypassed.\n“A hundred percent of the attacks succeeded, which tells you that there’s a trade-off,” DJ Sampath, the VP of product, AI software and platform at Cisco, tells WIRED. “Yes, it might have been cheaper to build something here, but the investment has perhaps not gone into thinking through what types of safety and security things you need to put inside of the model.”\nOther researchers have had similar findings. Separate analysis published today by the AI security company Adversa AI and shared with WIRED also suggests that DeepSeek is vulnerable to a wide range of jailbreaking tactics, from simple language tricks to complex AI-generated prompts.\nDeepSeek, which has been dealing with an avalanche of attention this week and has not spoken publicly about a range of questions, did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment about its model’s safety setup.\nGenerative AI models, like any technological system, can contain a host of weaknesses or vulnerabilities that, if exploited or set up poorly, can allow malicious actors to conduct attacks against them. For the current wave of AI systems, indirect prompt injection attacks are considered one of the biggest security flaws. These attacks involve an AI system taking in data from an outside source—perhaps hidden instructions of a website the LLM summarizes—and taking actions based on the information.\nJailbreaks, which are one kind of prompt-injection attack, allow people to get around the safety systems put in place to restrict what an LLM can generate. Tech companies don’t want people creating guides to making explosives or using their AI to create reams of disinformation, for example.\nJailbreaks started out simple, with people essentially crafting clever sentences to tell an LLM to ignore content filters—the most popular of which was called “Do Anything Now” or DAN for short. However, as AI companies have put in place more robust protections, some jailbreaks have become more sophisticated, often being generated using AI or using special and obfuscated characters. While all LLMs are susceptible to jailbreaks, and much of the information could be found through simple online searches, chatbots can still be used maliciously.\n“Jailbreaks persist simply because eliminating them entirely is nearly impossible—just like buffer overflow vulnerabilities in software (which have existed for over 40 years) or SQL injection flaws in web applications (which have plagued security teams for more than two decades),” Alex Polyakov, the CEO of security firm Adversa AI, told WIRED in an email.\nCisco’s Sampath argues that as companies use more types of AI in their applications, the risks are amplified. “It starts to become a big deal when you start putting these models into important complex systems and those jailbreaks suddenly result in downstream things that increases liability, increases business risk, increases all kinds of issues for enterprises,” Sampath says.\nThe Cisco researchers drew their 50 randomly selected prompts to test DeepSeek’s R1 from a well-known library of standardized evaluation prompts known as HarmBench. They tested prompts from six HarmBench categories, including general harm, cybercrime, misinformation, and illegal activities. They probed the model running locally on machines rather than through DeepSeek’s website or app, which send data to China.\nBeyond this, the researchers say they have also seen some potentially concerning results from testing R1 with more involved, non-linguistic attacks using things like Cyrillic characters and tailored scripts to attempt to achieve code execution. But for their initial tests, Sampath says, his team wanted to focus on findings that stemmed from a generally recognized benchmark.\nCisco also included comparisons of R1’s performance against HarmBench prompts with the performance of other models. And some, like Meta’s Llama 3.1, faltered almost as severely as DeepSeek’s R1. But Sampath emphasizes that DeepSeek’s R1 is a specific reasoning model, which takes longer to generate answers but pulls upon more complex processes to try to produce better results. Therefore, Sampath argues, the best comparison is with OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model, which fared the best of all models tested. (Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment).\nPolyakov, from Adversa AI, explains that DeepSeek appears to detect and reject some well-known jailbreak attacks, saying that “it seems that these responses are often just copied from OpenAI’s dataset.” However, Polyakov says that in his company’s tests of four different types of jailbreaks—from linguistic ones to code-based tricks—DeepSeek’s restrictions could easily be bypassed.\n“Every single method worked flawlessly,” Polyakov says. “What’s even more alarming is that these aren’t novel ‘zero-day’ jailbreaks—many have been publicly known for years,” he says, claiming he saw the model go into more depth with some instructions around psychedelics than he had seen any other model create.\n“DeepSeek is just another example of how every model can be broken—it’s just a matter of how much effort you put in. Some attacks might get patched, but the attack surface is infinite,” Polyakov adds. “If you’re not continuously red-teaming your AI, you’re already compromised.”",

    "content_text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced two Senate committees this week in his bid to be President Donald Trump’s secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Senators were alternately sympathetic and combative toward Kennedy’s views on health during his confirmation hearings on Wednesday and Thursday.\nKennedy, an environmental lawyer and former Democrat, ran in the 2024 presidential race but suspended his campaign in August and endorsed President Trump. An outspoken vaccine critic who has previously promoted the debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, Kennedy has toned down his rhetoric in recent months while doubling down on his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. Whether the old Kennedy or the new one would be leading HHS, though, seemed to be top of mind for Democrats and at least a few Republicans.\nKennedy tried to assure senators that he would promote vaccines as head of HHS. “News reports have claimed that I’m anti-vaccine or anti-industry. I am neither. I am pro-safety,” he told members of the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday. But on Thursday, when he went in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, he did not directly answer the question of whether he still believes vaccines cause autism.\nDuring the two days of hearings, he also distanced himself from previous pro-choice statements he made as a Democrat. He said that he agrees with the president that “states should control abortion” and that he would investigate the safety of the abortion medication mifepristone, despite decades of evidence showing that the drug is safe.\nKennedy floundered on questions about Medicare and Medicaid, which fall under HHS, when asked about specifics of those programs. Yet he found common ground with senators on both the left and right over his plans to promote nutrition, scrutinize chemical additives in food, and put more research effort into chronic diseases.\nIn his opening remarks both days, Kennedy focused on his Make America Healthy Again mission to tackle chronic diseases. “Today, Americans’ overall health is in grievous condition,” he said on Wednesday, noting rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and cancer. “The United States has worse health than any other developed nation, yet we spend far more on health care.” On Thursday, he reaffirmed his commitment to address the chronic disease epidemic, saying, “There’s never been an HHS secretary who came in to do this.”\nThroughout more than six hours of hearings spread out over two days, senators peppered Kennedy with questions about how he would handle a variety of other health issues that would be under his purview as head of HHS, including HIV/AIDS relief, rural hospitals, mental health care, and bird flu. On those issues, he said supports foreign assistance for controlling the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the use of AI and telehealth in resource-strapped rural hospitals, medications to treat addiction, and the development of vaccines for H5N1 avian influenza.\nBut Kennedy’s prior record of discrediting vaccines and his connection to the anti-vaccine movement was a major sticking point for Democrats and a handful of Republicans. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts suggested Wednesday that Kennedy could undercut vaccines by making changes to the country’s immunization schedule. In response, Kennedy said, “I support vaccines. I support the childhood schedule.” I will do that. The only thing I want is good science, and that’s it.”\nRepublican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine on Thursday also stressed the importance of vaccines and asked Kennedy to promise that he would use his position to promote confidence in them. “We can’t be going backward without our vaccines,” Murkowski said.\nA top Republican, Senator Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, said in Thursday’s hearing he was “struggling” with Kennedy’s nomination. “As a physician who’s been involved in immunization programs, I’ve seen the benefits of vaccinations. I know they save lives,” he said. “Your past of undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments concerns me. Can I trust that that is now in the past? Can data and information change your opinion, or will you only look for data supporting a predetermined conclusion?”\nThat past wasn’t all that long ago. Kennedy’s claims associating autism with vaccines go back years, but as recently as 2023 he said in an interview with Fox News, “I do believe that autism does come from vaccines.” Many large studies, however, have found no connection. In a podcast appearance the same year, Kennedy said, “There’s no vaccine that is safe and effective.”\nKennedy has previously raised doubts about the safety of the Covid-19 vaccines and HPV shot and questioned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines for when children should get vaccinated. From 2015 to 2023, he chaired Children’s Health Defense, an activist organization that has spread vaccine misinformation and filed lawsuits challenging vaccines.\nKennedy attempted to walk back many of those controversial remarks this week, saying some of them were taken out of context, but he repeatedly dodged the question of whether vaccines cause autism when grilled by Cassidy and Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont. Instead, Kennedy asked why the CDC hasn’t done more to investigate the causes of autism. “Why don’t we know the answer after 30 years of a steady rise in the autism rate? Why don’t we know the answer to that? We should know the answer.”\nIn fact, researchers think there is no single cause of autism but believe a combination of genetic factors and environmental ones, such as exposure to pollutants or viral infections, are at play. The increase in autism rates is likely due to greater awareness of the neurodevelopmental disorder and more testing in recent years.\nFor many Republican senators, Kennedy’s prior comments on vaccines did not seem to be an issue. Senator Rand Paul, a Republican and eye doctor from Kentucky, chose to not ask Kennedy any questions on Thursday and instead came to his defense. “The discussion over vaccines is so oversimplified and dumbed down that we never really get to real truths,” he said. “We don’t know what causes autism, so we should be more humble in what we say.”\nMarkwayne Mullin of Oklahoma echoed Paul’s sentiments, saying, “I don’t understand why my colleagues all of a sudden say we can’t question science.” Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said that his son and daughter-in-law have “done their research on vaccines” and that his granddaughter “won’t be a pincushion.”\nIt’s not clear from his confirmation hearings which Kennedy the American people would get as HHS secretary—the one that would erode public trust in vaccines or the one who openly supports them. And despite his reasonable, bipartisan positions on obesity and chronic diseases, his confirmation could hinge on the vaccine question.\nThe Senate Finance Committee is expected to vote next week on whether to advance Kennedy’s nomination to the full Senate, which will make the final decision on his confirmation. If confirmed, Kennedy would lead a vast agency with a $1.7 trillion budget that includes the CDC, Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",

    "content_text": "It’s been just over a week since DeepSeek upended the AI world. The introduction of its open-weight model—apparently trained on a fraction of the specialized computing chips that power industry leaders—set off shock waves inside OpenAI. Not only did employees claim to see hints that DeepSeek had “inappropriately distilled” OpenAI’s models to create its own, but the startup's success had Wall Street questioning whether companies like OpenAI were wildly overspending on compute.\n“DeepSeek R1 is AI's Sputnik moment,” wrote Marc Andreessen, one of Silicon Valley’s most influential and provocative inventors, on X.\nIn response, OpenAI is preparing to launch a new model today, ahead of its originally planned schedule. The model, o3-mini, will debut in both API and chat. Sources say it has o1 level reasoning with 4o-level speed. In other words, it’s fast, cheap, smart, and designed to crush DeepSeek. (OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix says work on o3-mini began long before DeepSeek's debut and the goal was to launch by the end of January).\nThe moment has galvanized OpenAI staff. Inside the company, there’s a feeling that—particularly as DeepSeek dominates the conversation—OpenAI must become more efficient or risk falling behind its newest competitor.\nPart of the issue stems from OpenAI’s origins as a nonprofit research organization before becoming a profit-seeking powerhouse. An ongoing power struggle between the research and product groups, employees claim, has resulted in a rift between the teams working on advanced reasoning and those working on chat. (OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix says this is “incorrect” and notes that the leaders of these teams, chief product officer Kevin Weil and chief research officer Mark Chen, “meet every week and work closely to align on product and research priorities.”)\nSome inside OpenAI want the company to build a unified chat product, one model that can tell whether a question requires advanced reasoning. So far, that hasn’t happened. Instead, a drop-down menu in ChatGPT prompts users to decide whether they want to use GPT-4o (“great for most questions”) or o1 (“uses advanced reasoning”).\nSome staffers claim that while chat brings in the lion’s share of OpenAI’s revenue, o1 gets more attention—and computing resources—from leadership. “Leadership doesn’t care about chat,” says a former employee who worked on (you guessed it) chat. “Everyone wants to work on o1 because it’s sexy, but the code base wasn’t built for experimentation, so there’s no momentum.” The former employee asked to remain anonymous, citing a nondisclosure agreement.\nOpenAI spent years experimenting with reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model that eventually became the advanced reasoning system called o1. (Reinforcement learning is a process that trains AI models with a system of penalties and rewards.) DeepSeek built off the reinforcement learning work that OpenAI had pioneered in order to create its advanced reasoning system, called R1. “They benefited from knowing that reinforcement learning, applied to language models, works,” says a former OpenAI researcher who is not authorized to speak publicly about the company.\n“The reinforcement learning [DeepSeek] did is similar to what we did at OpenAI,” says another former OpenAI researcher, “but they did it with better data and cleaner stack.”\nOpenAI employees say research that went into o1 was done in a code base, called the “berry” stack, built for speed. “There were trade-offs—experimental rigor for throughput,” says a former employee with direct knowledge of the situation.\nThose trade-offs made sense for o1, which was essentially an enormous experiment, code base limitations notwithstanding. They did not make as much sense for chat, a product used by millions of users that was built on a different, more reliable stack. When o1 launched and became a product, cracks started to emerge in OpenAI’s internal processes. “It was like, ‘why are we doing this in the experimental codebase, shouldn’t we do this in the main product research codebase?’” the employee explains. “There was major pushback to that internally.”\nLast year, the company announced Project Sputnik internally—an effort to go through the code and figure out which parts should merge and which parts should remain separate.\nEmployees believe the project was not fully realized. Rather than merge the stacks, employees were encouraged to simply prioritize using the “berry” stack, which angered some people working on chat. An OpenAI spokesperson denies this and says Project Sputnik was successfully deployed.\nThe perceived issues with the codebase had tangible repercussions, sources say. Ideally, after an employee launches a training job, the GPUs involved in that job are freed up for someone else to use. The way the berry code base is structured, that doesn’t always happen. “People would just squat on the GPUs,” one former employee says. “There was gridlock.”\nOutside OpenAI, the industry is divided on how to interpret DeepSeek’s success. Earlier this week, shares of Nvidia plunged as investors worried that the industry had wildly overestimated the number of chips needed to work on AI.\nBut that interpretation is shortsighted, experts say. If DeepSeek discovered a way to do model development more efficiently, as it claims, it might accelerate the model development process, but ultimately the winner will still be the company with the most chips.\n“You do need less compute per unit of intelligence, but people are still going to want more units to scale up even more,” says Miles Brundage, an independent AI policy researcher who worked at OpenAI for six years, most recently as a senior adviser for AGI readiness.\nPerhaps Stargate, OpenAI’s flashy new infrastructure project, will ease the feeling of scarcity internally. Crusoe, the company building Stargate’s first data centers in Abilene, Texas, has already broken ground on a 998,000 square foot facility, according to Andrew Schmitt, a spokesperson for the company.\nWhile the details of the project are opaque, I’m told it could grow to encompass more data centers, chip manufacturing, and supercomputers. OpenAI plans to appoint a new CEO to lead the project—at least in theory.\nCurrent CEO Sam Altman “is very good at making promises of what will happen in the future. And then in the future those things are just completely unreliable,” says another former staffer.\nTime Travel\nIn 2023, Steven Levy provided a definitive look inside OpenAI in the months before its various, highly publicized upheavals. Even then, the tensions that are boiling over today were already apparent.\nIt’s not fair to call OpenAI a cult, but when I asked several of the company’s top brass if someone could comfortably work there if they didn’t believe AGI was truly coming—and that its arrival would mark one of the greatest moments in human history—most executives didn’t think so. Why would a nonbeliever want to work here? they wondered. The assumption is that the workforce—now at approximately 500, though it might have grown since you began reading this paragraph—has self-selected to include only the faithful. At the very least, as Altman puts it, once you get hired, it seems inevitable that you’ll be drawn into the spell.\nAt the same time, OpenAI is not the company it once was. It was founded as a purely nonprofit research operation, but today most of its employees technically work for a profit-making entity that is reportedly valued at almost $30 billion. Altman and his team now face the pressure to deliver a revolution in every product cycle, in a way that satisfies the commercial demands of investors and keeps ahead in a fiercely competitive landscape. All while hewing to a quasi-messianic mission to elevate humanity rather than exterminate it.\nThat kind of pressure—not to mention the unforgiving attention of the entire world—can be a debilitating force. The Beatles set off colossal waves of cultural change, but they anchored their revolution for only so long: Six years after chiming that unforgettable chord they weren’t even a band anymore. The maelstrom OpenAI has unleashed will almost certainly be far bigger. But the leaders of OpenAI swear they’ll stay the course. All they want to do, they say, is build computers smart enough and safe enough to end history, thrusting humanity into an era of unimaginable bounty.\nEnd Times Chronicle\nA passenger flight crashed into a military helicopter in Washington, DC, on Wednesday evening.\nLast but Not Least\nDeepSeek left a core database exposed, leaking 1 million records, including user prompts and API authentication tokens.\nElon Musk told friends he’s been sleeping at the DOGE offices near the White House.\nAnd, no big surprise, Elon Musk lackeys have already started taking over the US Office of Personnel Management.",

DeepSeek built off the reinforcement learning work that OpenAI had pioneered in order to create its advanced reasoning system, called R1. “They benefited from knowing that reinforcement learning, applied to language models, works,” says a former OpenAI researcher who is not authorized to speak publicly about the company.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“The reinforcement learning [DeepSeek] did is similar to what we did at OpenAI,” says another former OpenAI researcher, “but they did it with better data and cleaner stack.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">OpenAI employees say research that went into o1 was done in a code base, called the “berry” stack, built for speed. “There were trade-offs—experimental rigor for throughput,” says a former employee with direct knowledge of the situation.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Those trade-offs made sense for o1, which was essentially an enormous experiment, code base limitations notwithstanding. They did not make as much sense for chat, a product used by millions of users that was built on a different, more reliable stack. When o1 launched and became a product, cracks started to emerge in OpenAI’s internal processes. “It was like, ‘why are we doing this in the experimental codebase, shouldn’t we do this in the main product research codebase?’” the employee explains. “There was major pushback to that internally.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nNo matter how badly you want to be there, the top of a mountain is a harsh environment. Like the best sunglasses, a good ski goggle will protect your eyes from UV rays, winds, and driving snow. On bluebird days, snow reflects 85 percent of the sunlight, and the intensity increases by 10 to 12 percent for every 3,281 feet (1,000 meters) you gain in altitude.\nWith that said, every skier knows that you don't get to enjoy powder days without plenty of snow, and when accumulation occurs, clouds arrive and visibility drops. Thankfully, the best ski goggles come with interchangeable lenses with variable tints to help boost your ability to see in the worst conditions. Remember, you can’t ski if you can’t see.

Subscribe Today.\nHow We Tested Ski Goggles\nI've been reviewing winter sports equipment for over 15 years. When I'm in the mountains, I test goggles in as many conditions as possible. I evaluate fit, the comfort, breathability and, most importantly, visibility. Not all faces are the same shape, so I always seek the opinion of fellow skiers while also asking the experts which designs they prefer, including WIRED's senior innovation editor Jeremy White. I've only once managed to drop a lens—mid-change—from a particularly high chairlift.\nWhich Lenses Do I Need?\nAll ski goggle lenses are categorized from 0 to 4, with 4 being for the brightest conditions possible. A 0 is a clear lens; a good all-around lens will usually cover categories 2–3. Another measure of lens application is the visual light transmission percentage (VLT). This figure shows you the amount of light the lens lets through to your eyes. The higher the percentage, the more light can pass through, which helps with visibility on cloudy days. For sunny days, you want to restrict the light reaching your eyes.\nWhat color you pick is a matter of personal preference—lenses now come in a wide range of colors! In general, dark or mirrored lenses work best in sunny conditions, while colors like amber or rose increase contrast in lower-light conditions. Photochromic lenses automatically adjust to light levels in categories 1–3, although the speed with which the lens changes color differs between brands.\n- When it's extremely sunny: Choose a category 3–4 (8–18 percent and 3–8 percent VLT).\n- For bright conditions: Choose a category 3 (8–18 percent VLT).\n- When conditions are mixed: Opt for an all-round lens with category 2–3 (18–43 percent and 8–18 percent VLT).\n- When visibility is poor: Choose a yellow- or rose-colored lens tint with category 1–2 (43–80 percent and 18–43 percent VLT).\nFeatures to Look For\n- Interchangeable lenses: These let you easily swap out different-colored lenses to suit changing light conditions. The best designs use strong magnets and enable you to change the lenses in seconds, even wearing gloves.\n- Ventilation: Look closely and you'll see vents on the top, sides and bottom of your goggles. These are designed to keep a steady stream of air flowing, and minimize the chance of fogging. The larger the vents, the more air flow can get to the lenses.\n- Antifog coating: Antifog lenses are treated on the inside with a hydrophilic chemical to prevent them from steaming up. The secret to maintaining the antifog properties of your goggles is to never touch the inside of your lenses, even if you feel you absolutely must wipe them. Do not!\n- Mirrored lenses: These look cool but also reflect more light than standard lenses, reducing glare in bright conditions.\n- Polarized lenses: These filter vertical light to reduce glare more effectively than standard mirrored goggles and offer increased clarity. Be warned, though—polarized lenses might make icy patches harder to see.\n- Helmet compatibility: Given that most skiers are now sensible enough to wear helmets, look for a model that fits your lid seamlessly. This avoids any cold spots on your forehead and pressure points across the bridge of your nose. Buying the same brand of goggle and helmet is one way to ensure a seamless fit, or you could try one of the latest all-in-one helmets, which have goggles built in.\nWhat Type of Ski Goggle Do I Need?\nChoose a lens shape: Cylindrical lenses look flat and are curved around the face on the vertical axis. These are cheaper to manufacture than spherical lenses, and when used on a large pair of goggles can offer a vast field of view. Spherical lenses are curved both vertically and horizontally and give the goggles a bug-eyed look. Spherical lenses help to open up more of the view, especially the up and down aspects. You'll pay more for spherical lenses, but they can be truly impressive.\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, cylindrical lenses are more popular, but the latest (and most expensive) toric lenses offer a compromise. This hybrid lens combines a sweeping widescreen cylindrical style with a tightly curved spherical section at he edges. These do a great job of increasing the amount of peripheral vision, especially when looking down the slopes in front of you.\nOversize goggles: Oversize goggles have been popular for a decade, and while there's been a shift back to a thick framed ’90s style for some, large goggles do offer bold looks and the biggest possible field of view. Don't worry, however, if you have a small head and face, as all our best-buy options also come in a smaller size boasting the same proportions and features.\nChildren’s goggles: 100 percent UV protection is obviously the most important factor when choosing goggles for your kids, but comfort is also key, so look for designs with soft fleecy padding around the face. Given how much abuse kids goggles tend to receive it can be tempting to buy the cheapest pair. But cheap goggles have poor antifog coating, which means a higher chance of your kids not being able to see properly—and complaining. Grumpy kids means less time for you on the mountain.\nOTG (over-the-glasses) goggles: An essential for people who wear glasses, these ski goggles have extra space for your spectacles, with cut-out sections in the foam for the arms so they're not pressed uncomfortably against your face. Some OTG goggles won't fit large-framed glasses, so it's worth trying before you buy. If you can't wear contact lenses, another option is to invest in a prescription insert, which clips inside compatible goggles.",

    "content_text": "For the team at North Thin Ply Technology (NTPT), a Lausanne-based manufacturer of high-tech composites for America’s Cup yachts, satellites, F1 cars, and aerospace, abstruse topics like interlaminar fracture toughness, the chemistry of resin matrices, and the elastic modulus of fiber-based materials are meat and drink.\nLess typical, in an industry where performance trumps aesthetics, is NTPT’s knack for creating … well, pretty colors and lively patterns within lumps of hardcore materials. But NTPT’s work with Richard Mille, the Swiss watch brand known for engineering and designs as highly evolved as its price points (the average is around $311,000 a watch), has taken its R&D team down some divergent innovatory paths, says Olivier Thomassin, the engineer charged with overseeing the Richard Mille collaboration. “It’s led us into investigating a lot of new processes to make patterns and develop new colors, and we’ve spent a lot of time finding ways to bond together unusual materials,” he says. “It’s not the kind of thing a company like this normally does.”\nThere is little in the watch world that resembles Carbon TPT and Quartz TPT, the composites from which NTPT makes cases for Richard Mille. The flagship watch of the brand’s partnership with McLaren Automotive, the RM 11-03, features both: rippling layers of charcoal-toned carbon interlaced with bands of lurid orange. The RM 74-02, a svelte but showy skeletonized tourbillon, repeats the trick with seams of yellow gold fused into the carbon, something Thomassin says took three years to get right.\nOr else look to the RM 65-01, a high-octane split-seconds chronograph inspired by motorsports, which recently received a Gen Z–friendly glow-up with versions in banana yellow, baby blue, or soft gray. The colored material has the lightness and feel of plastic, but is several times stronger than stainless steel.\nFor both firms, the collaboration has become a crucial calling card, such that a dedicated facility was opened at NTPT’s Lausanne headquarters in 2018, just for making Richard Mille watch cases. Behind the glass walls of this all-white inner sanctum, a big robotic printer shifts repeatedly back and forth along a large table, busily laying down precise strips of sticky-looking material on a spotless surface. Staff in white coveralls administer the machinery, while, to the rear, spools of see-through fibers feed mysteriously into equipment that will process them into micro-thin layers of “UD” (unidirectional tape), the stuff the machine is depositing.\nFor Richard Mille, color and texture actually turned out to be the by-product of a challenge the brand’s eponymous founder set NTPT more than a decade ago. The firm was already making Richard Mille watch cases out of its carbon-fiber variant, Carbon TPT, but Mille asked to brighten the template, says Thomassin. “He said he wanted a composite for a pure white case, so we started experimenting. We actually ended up with red first.”\nMost fiber-based composites—think Kevlar, fiberglass, or forged carbon—share basic principles with materials such as concrete or MDF: Tiny strands of a given material are set within a binding matrix, usually a polymer resin, like epoxy. The mixture is shaped, compressed, and heat-cured. The resulting composite is typically very light and extremely strong, with the fibers serving as structural reinforcements to the surrounding matrix.\nIt was by using fibers from quartz, a material paradoxically associated with cheapness in watches, that NTPT changed the game for Richard Mille. Being transparent in its purest silica form, quartz composites tend to be used in areas like optics, sensors, medical scanners, and weapon systems.\n“Because it’s opaque, we can get a real color into the resin mix, and keep that color fixed in,” says Thomassin. “It’s the only fiber where we can do that.”\nSince NTPT specializes in the chemical formulation of its own resin solutions, it was able to research ways to add rich pigments, and to fix these within a composite called Quartz TPT. The first Richard Mille watches to use it, in stripy white and bright red respectively, appeared in 2015. The terrifically odd look—bold colors whipped through with layered textures—quickly became an exclusive and conspicuous calling card for the brand.\nEvery shade and style, says Alexandre Mille, the watch company’s global commercial director, is the result of extensive R&D.\n“It isn’t just picking a Pantone or a treatment and adding it in. Every new color represents a substantial technical effort to produce it and to get it right, without any compromise to the material itself,” he says. For instance, the light gray shade seen in last year’s RM 65-01 was originally intended for another watch. “That was three years ago, but it wasn’t ready,” says Mille. “So we continued refining it until we could use it.”\nBack in the noughties, it was the transformation of Formula 1 and supercar engineering that first brought carbon fiber, along with other novel composites, to the attention of luxury watch brands. Richard Mille was an early adopter: When he’d founded his brand in 2001, his big idea was to translate the high-tech wonder of frontline automotive engineering into something wrist-bound—“a racing car for the wrist” as he described it.\nAccordingly, all manner of material innovations and technical ideas—carbon nanotubes, graphene, silicon carbide, movements suspended in pulleys—have made their way into Richard Mille’s watchmaking. It is responsible for some of the lightest and thinnest watches ever made, such as the 1.75-millimeter-thick RM UP-01 Ferrari. But it is the partnership with NTPT, a company that emerged from the marine engineering sector (it started out in sail-making technology) that has been especially transformative. Alexandre Mille describes the relationship as “like working with a brother. There’s a lot of cross-pollination of ideas, depending on what they are researching that can inspire creative concepts for us, or vice versa.”\nThe research that led to the use of opaque quartz does carry a downside: Unless the manufacturing environment is very closely controlled, dust particles and other impurities will show up in the finished material. For most NTPT products that wouldn’t be a problem, but the luxury industry—and particularly quarter-million-dollar watches—requires a different level of perfectionism. Hence the facility’s sealed-off “clean room” environment.\nThe “thin ply technology” in NTPT’s name refers to the use of much thinner layers (or plies) of resin-impregnated material than is found in standard composites. Thomassin says this allows for greater precision in tailoring the mechanical properties of whatever is being made, as well as achieving the kind of aesthetic consistency that a luxury product requires.\nThe base fibers arrive from suppliers as rolls of thread, which are stacked up and distributed via an intricate creel system. The translucent quartz thread consists of over a thousand tiny, interwound silica fibers or filaments, each one no more than a few microns in diameter. NTPT’s proprietary system unravels these filaments from each other and aligns them in a wider, unidirectional layer, before binding them in resin to create a broad “prepreg” tape that’s at most 45 microns thick.\nA roll of the prepreg tape is loaded into a robot device known as an ATL (automatic tape laydown). With its boxy red body and rivets, the ATL rather resembles a giant piece of Meccano, skimming slowly back and forth as it builds up a precise crosshatch of layers.\nIt’s the overlaying of these prepreg layers in strictly angled sequences that allows factors like load-bearing capacity, stiffness, fatigue performance, and resistance to cracking to be managed and directed. While more intensive to manufacture, thin-ply composites are designed to maintain part integrity over longer periods, and at greater stresses, than standard composites with thicker plies. (Elsewhere in the building, a lab puts bits of composite through all manner of trials—pulling, twisting, compressing to breaking point—though Richard Mille’s own suite of tests is apparently even more demanding.)\nFor the watch cases, this means layering at 45-degree increments—what’s known as a “quasi-isotropic” formation, meaning near-uniform strength and stiffness in every direction. Stacks of this preform (the combined layers) are then laid by hand onto curved molds. Between the watch case body and the bezel that sits on top, there are around 600 plies in total which, as they bond together, creates the unique striated patterning. The hallmark wavy stripes of a watch like the RM 35-03, the latest signature piece for tennis superstar Rafael Nadal, available in either a silvery-gray, or deep blue with rippling bands of light blue, are made by including differently colored stacks at regular intervals.\nFusing and hardening the material takes place under heat and pressure in an autoclave oven resembling a small blue submersible. Lengths of composite, laid on the molds and sealed in vacuum bags, are compressed at 6 bars and heated to 120 degrees C. The resulting Quartz TPT block is finally cut up into barrel-shaped case blanks by a high-precision waterjet, before being sent to Richard Mille’s own manufacturing facility in the Jura mountains for CNC machining into finished watch cases.\nQuartz watches they may be, but also around 3,000 times more expensive—and about the same degree more engineered—than what that term customarily means.",

Like J9tXv, their identities are concealed behind their crypto wallet addresses.\nAs the hours passed, word spread, investors piled in, and the price of TRUMP ballooned. At its peak, the value of the circulating coins exceeded $14 billion. The early traders, who by now had made a killing, began to cash out.\nOn January 18, J9tXv moved their entire TRUMP stash to another wallet. The lion’s share of the coins were then diverted to yet further wallets and mostly sold. The remainder were sold the following day across nine transactions, which brought in more than $30 million. In all, the original trade returned many tens of millions of dollars in profit.\nWIRED asked two experts in crypto forensics to analyze these early TRUMP trades. Though multiple theories might explain their striking punctuality—among them blind luck—another possibility is that the traders were warned of the launch in advance, the crypto forensics experts hypothesize. In trading any new asset, an alleged early warning would put any trader at an immense advantage, allowing them to buy in earlier and at a lower price than almost everyone else.\n“To be that quick off the mark, it’s hard to imagine that they had no forewarning,” says Paul Sibenik, CEO at CryptoForensic Investigators, a company that investigates crypto-related cybercrime.\nThough new crypto coins are frequently traded in the minutes after launch, the willingness of J9tXv and others to wager such large sums on TRUMP in those early moments—when people were still scrambling to work out whether the coin was the real deal—is highly irregular, says John Powers, president at the private investigation agency Hudson Intelligence.\n“Someone that has an active investment portfolio or team of people that are managing money could certainly put together a plan and make an informed decision within twelve to twenty-four hours,” alleges Powers. “But something that happens in the first 90 seconds suggests either potential advanced insider knowledge or some other possible explanation.”\nThe White House press office declined to comment. A request for comment delivered to the email address listed on the TRUMP website went unanswered.\nTRUMP is pitched as a memecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that typically serves no purpose, promises no utility, and has no underlying business model. The price of a memecoin tends to swing violently with the caprices of the public mood.\nIn the memecoin trading game, getting in early is everything. “There’s no fundamental value in any of these coins, so it’s about just being very, very early,” says Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at the blockchain analytics company Nansen, which analyzed patterns in the trading data for WIRED.\nThe crypto wallets that invested the largest sums in TRUMP largely purchased the coin on January 18, the day it launched, according to Nansen analysis. The wallets that achieved the greatest return on their TRUMP investments, meanwhile, had largely sold off their holdings by January 20, by which time the price had already tumbled from its peak. The circulating TRUMP coins are now valued at $5.4 billion.\n“The earlier you are, the more you can bet. But if you’ve bet a lot, it doesn’t make sense to stay a long time, because it’s not going to be [the next] Apple or Nvidia,” says Barthere. “There is zero value. So for sure it’s going to go down.”\nAmong the wallets that have profited most handsomely from TRUMP, Nansen data shows, are many that dealt in comparatively small sums, which implies that some regular people managed to beat the crowd in the same way as the big early traders. In the midst of the high-value trades placed by J9tXv and others in the minutes after TRUMP launched, armchair traders were throwing down as little as 50 bucks.\nBeyond an incredible stroke of fortune and gall, Sibenik and Powers claim, only one other theory could explain traders plowing hundreds of thousands of dollars into TRUMP so soon after it was unveiled: The trades were placed by automated sniping bots.\nSniping bots are typically programmed to snatch up multiple different coins immediately after launch, says Powers. Some of the wallets used to place the early high-value TRUMP trades do contain tens of other memecoins, but others, including J9tXv, contain only a few.\n“What we would not expect to see from a bot would be an acquisition of one token only with a large position, especially if that token hadn’t been previously announced. That activity seems too specific,” says Powers. “How do you code the script for a bot to acquire one token before you know it exists?”\nMost sniping bots are also programmed to deal in smaller dollar amounts, says Sibenik. “[The big early traders] either being insiders or having insight from another party are more likely explanations, especially given the very large amounts invested,” Sibenik says.\nIn the absence of any rules governing memecoins in the US, it may not necessarily be illegal for an issuer to give early notice to select parties.\nRecently, multiple federal lawsuits brought by investors have sought to argue that memecoins should fall under securities laws, governed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a regulatory agency tasked with protecting US investors. But in an interview on January 23, venture capitalist David Sacks, appointed by Trump as the US AI and crypto czar, claimed that memecoins should be treated as a type of collectible, an unregulated asset class.\nIn an executive order signed on January 23, Trump established a “working group on digital assets,” which he tasked with recommending appropriate crypto-related regulation and legislation.\n“The cryptocurrency industry is still driving for clarity on regulation. The major players want to be seen as good faith actors in financial markets,” says Powers. “There has been some disgruntlement expressed from within the [crypto] industry of this memecoin offering seeming to take advantage of the moment.”\nAt the foot of the TRUMP website, a small-print disclaimer asserts that the memecoin is “not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.” The terms and conditions, meanwhile, stipulate that investors must waive the right to bring a class action lawsuit in relation to the memecoin. They also claim that investors are not entitled to pursue damages, even in the event of “deceptive and unfair trade practices” and “misrepresentation” on the part of the Trump-affiliated company administering the coin.\n“That’s a stunning caveat,” says Powers. “Whether those kinds of waivers and disclaimers would actually hold up in court is another matter. But setting down the road with that attitude is not in keeping with the hope of the crypto industry to turn the page on what came before.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is still wrapped in mystery. Its recent reveal teased a few details—a larger overall design, redesigned Joy-Con controllers, backward compatibility, and what's likely to be Mario Kart 9 as a launch title among them—but Nintendo remains tight-lipped about hardware specifications, services, and how the overall experience will improve on the existing, ultra-successful Switch console.\nNintendo is playing it safe, and while more details are set to be revealed in a dedicated Nintendo Direct broadcast on April 2, there are undoubtedly areas where the upcoming console could improve on its predecessor. Here are just five things I think the Switch 2 needs to succeed.\nBetter Online Services\nWhile Nintendo has already done some housekeeping on this front—gone are the nightmare days of coexisting Nintendo Network IDs and Nintendo Accounts—there's still much the company could do to improve its digital services.\nFirstly, its eShop store for buying games is in need of a major overhaul. On the current Switch, it's messy, slow, and a chore to navigate. What should be simple browsing tools—exploring by genre, for instance—are buried under the search tab, and there's no way to sort titles alphabetically, only by relevance, popularity, release date, or price orders.\nThe web browser experience is even worse—access the eShop through Nintendo.com and you get what looks more like an info page than a storefront. Scroll down and click through to any of the categories to find some games and you'll discover an interface so dated it lets you filter for games available on the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, platforms that haven't been purchasable since March 2023. Although the Nintendo Switch still enjoys a relatively strong showing for physical game sales, industry analyst Mat Piscatella says 53 percent of Switch game sales between January and August 2024 were digital. Discovery and exploration of Nintendo's digital storefront simply has to improve.\nThen there's Nintendo Switch Online, its subscription service. This is Nintendo's equivalent to PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass, and like its competitors, it unlocks online multiplayer support. It also offers access to a curated selection of retro titles from the NES, SNES, and Game Boy (plus more from N64, Game Boy Advance, and even former rival Sega Mega Drive/Genesis for those with the bolted-on Expansion Pack membership).\nThe Switch 2 has the chance to do two pretty cool things here. One, expand that retro selection, bringing in titles from the GameCube era—and rumors of a return of the GameCube controller indicate Nintendo may be gearing up to do exactly that. Two, bring back the ability, last seen on Wii U, to buy digital downloads of past-gen games outright. This would allow Nintendo to potentially cycle the selection of games included in the NSO catalog, as Sony and Microsoft do with their subscriber-only libraries, and allow Switch 2 owners to build a multigenerational collection all on one console. That would tie in nicely with Nintendo's approach to backward compatibility for Switch 2, which brings us to …\nBoosted Backward Compatibility\nIt's no secret that some Nintendo Switch games struggle with the limitations of running on eight-year-old hardware. Switch games are rarely the most visually astounding on a technical level, although developers often work near-miracles with smart art direction, crafting worlds full of wonder and charm. Still, when even some of Nintendo's own biggest titles are notably underperforming in matters of frame rate, draw distances, and textures—the last couple of core Pokémon games, Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet being particularly egregious examples—there's a problem.\nIt's a problem the Switch 2 could potentially solve if the new hardware's backward compatibility can improve the performance of original Switch games in the process. However, if implemented, it's unlikely this would be a magic wand where more onboard processing and rendering power instantly gives older games a fresh lick of digital paint. As with Sony's PS5 Pro, where games need bespoke patches from the developer to make use of the beefier hardware, the same may be the case for Switch 2 to “upgrade” Switch 1 games.\nThat would put the onus on developers to ensure that games can take advantage of any enhancements the Switch 2 offers. But if done well—avoiding Sony’s mistakes when its PS5 Pro patches initially made games look worse—boosting backward compatibility could make Switch 2 the definitive home to at least two generations of gaming greatness.\nImproved Screen Resolutions\nThat's resolutions, plural. The current Switch has a 1280 x 720-pixel resolution display in handheld mode, rising to a maximum of 1920 x 1080 when docked and outputting to a TV. The Switch 2 needs to go higher, in every sense. In a world of handheld gaming PCs such as the Asus ROG Ally X with 1080p screens or the Lenovo Legion Go offering up to 2560 X 1600 resolution, the Switch 2 needs to deliver a minimum of 1080p Full HD in handheld mode.\nDocked, that 1080p needs to leap to 4K, 3840 x 2160 pixels. If you've bought a new TV in the last five to 10 years, it's almost certainly built for that resolution, so anything less from the Switch 2 will feel antiquated. I could see some flexibility on this point, though. While “true” 4K would be nice—perhaps unlocked with some extra processing power built into the dock itself, which could allow the console to render in Ultra HD—given that Nintendo rarely plays the numbers game in the same way Sony or Microsoft do, upscaled 4K would probably be broadly acceptable to most players. The PS4 Pro, which the Switch 2 is rumored to be roughly on par with, achieved some impressive results with 4K upscaling, so it'd be nice to see the Switch 2 match this benchmark.\nBring Back Media Apps\nThe Switch launched with no media apps at all and, throughout its life, Nintendo added only a handful like YouTube, anime streaming service Crunchyroll, Hulu in the US, and Niconico in Japan. This was partly down to Nintendo's intentional strategy that the Switch is not a multimedia device—Reggie Fils-Aimé, then chief operating officer at Nintendo of America, said in 2017 that it was built “to be a world-class gaming device, meaning we want you first and foremost to play games on the system.” Still, there's no denying that access to streaming apps on a console is convenient.\nIt's not as though the idea is alien to Nintendo. The Wii U had a native Netflix app, and the Wii even had a dedicated BBC iPlayer app in the UK. The Wii U also saw Nintendo dabble with integrated TV services with its Nintendo TVii tool combining content providers into one portal. The demand is there too, with fans still asking for streaming services on the existing Switch.\nWhile the Switch 2 will still likely chase that ideal of being a “world-class gaming device,” the upcoming console's bigger screen makes it particularly enticing to imagine watching your favorite shows or movies on the go. Nintendo really shouldn't rule it out.\nMore New Games\nThis is the big one. A major factor in the original Switch's success was the failure of its own predecessor, the Wii U. Approximately 47 people bought one (OK, more than 13 million people, but that's a far cry from the 101 million Wii owners or the 146 million and counting who've bought a Switch), which meant a lot of people missed out on some genuinely great games that launched on the console. The likes of Mario Kart 8, Super Mario 3D World, and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker provided Nintendo with a ready-made pool of titles to port to the Switch, where most players first discovered them.\nThat tactic won't work again. For one, the well is drier—even cult favorite titles such as Xenoblade Chronicles X, The Wonderful 101, and Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE (a crossover between Atlus' Shin Megami Tensei and Nintendo's Fire Emblem series) have made the transition to Switch. Even older console generations have been tapped for modern ports, with the likes of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Metroid Prime coming to Switch from GameCube (the latter, at least, significantly upgraded as Metroid Prime Remastered). While it could continue looking further back into its archives for more remasters—Zelda fans are still crying out for modern, accessible versions of The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess, for example—the older the source material, the more effort is required to remaster or remake it for present-day tech.\nWith the Switch 2's backward compatibility, there's also less need to revive games from the preceding generation. Millions of people will have already played, say, Luigi's Mansion 3 and will still be able to play it on Switch 2—a rerelease would feel redundant. There isn't that pool of easily accessible, largely overlooked, and reasonably easy-to-port content waiting for Switch 2 that there was for the original Switch.\nInstead, the Switch 2 needs to go hard on brand-new games, to a degree not seen for years. Nintendo shouldn't see this as an obstacle but an opportunity. While we'll assuredly see fresh entries for its flagship series—Super Mario, Pokémon, Super Smash Bros—the company sits on a gold mine of IP with baked-in audiences who have been waiting years, if not literal decades, for new entries.\nSure, we're already guaranteed a new Mario Kart on Switch 2, but there hasn't been a big-budget, full-scale F-Zero since 2003. That series delivers an entirely different type of racing action, so it's surely time for Captain Falcon to take another lap, especially considering the futuristic racer was one of the few in the genre to incorporate something of a story mode. Or Star Fox—the anthropomorphic space shooter last appeared with 2016's Star Fox Zero (one of the few Wii U games not to get a Switch rerelease), so a return is overdue. Donkey Kong hasn't had a new adventure in a decade; Kid Icarus in 13 years. 1080° Snowboarding hasn't taken to the slopes in 22. Let's see some of those titles brought back for brand-new outings.\nYet even more exciting than the revival of long-dormant properties is the potential the Switch 2 has to bring entirely new gaming experiences to the console. If rumors of the next-gen Joy-Con controllers having mouse-like features turn out to be true—and Nintendo has prior form on this, with the likes of the SNES Mouse—then it opens the door for Switch 2 to more authentically present everything from grand strategy games to point-and-click adventures, genres that rarely translate well to joypad controls.\nAnother factor that will boost Switch 2's game library is the confirmation that Microsoft will be supporting the console. While no games have yet been confirmed, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Diablo 4, and even Microsoft Flight Simulator are rumored to be coming to Nintendo's new console. Call of Duty is also likely to make an appearance in some capacity, given the franchise will continue to see multiplatform releases despite Microsoft buying publisher Activision.\nIf done well, the Switch 2 could be as diverse a platform as the PC is for gaming—and if Nintendo serves up some of the other points on our wish list, it could outshine even the original Switch.",

This was partly down to Nintendo's intentional strategy that the Switch <em>is not</em> a multimedia device—Reggie Fils-Aimé, then chief operating officer at Nintendo of America, said <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/08/nintendos-u-s-ceo-responds-to-our-biggest-gripes-with-the-switch/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/08/nintendos-u-s-ceo-responds-to-our-biggest-gripes-with-the-switch/\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/08/nintendos-u-s-ceo-responds-to-our-biggest-gripes-with-the-switch/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in 2017</a> that it was built “to be a world-class gaming device, meaning we want you first and foremost to play games on the system.” Still, there's no denying that access to streaming apps on a console is convenient.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It's not as though the idea is alien to Nintendo. The Wii U had a native Netflix app, and the Wii even had a dedicated BBC iPlayer app in the UK. The Wii U also saw Nintendo dabble with integrated TV services with its <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Network#Nintendo_TVii\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Network#Nintendo_TVii\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Network#Nintendo_TVii\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo TVii</a> tool combining content providers into one portal.

Nintendo really shouldn't rule it out.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">More New Games</h2><p class=\"paywall\">This is the big one. A major factor in the original Switch's success was the failure of its own predecessor, the Wii U. Approximately 47 people bought one (OK, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more than 13 million people</a>, but that's a far cry from the 101 million Wii owners or the 146 million and counting who've bought a Switch), which meant a lot of people missed out on some genuinely great games that launched on the console. The likes of <em>Mario Kart 8, Super Mario 3D World,</em> and <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> provided Nintendo with a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-games/\">ready-made pool of titles</a> to port to the Switch, where most players first discovered them.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Courtesy of Nintendo</span></div></figure></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "In his new memoir, Bill Gates doesn’t mention any study of William Wordsworth’s writings. But when I read Source Code: My Beginnings, I thought of the English poet’s famous line from 1802: “The child is father of the man.” Nearly the entire volume is devoted to Gates’ early years, with Microsoft’s origin story entering the narrative in the final chapters. (A second volume will discuss his company, and a third will focus on his work with the Gates Foundation.)\nIn more than 40 years of interactions with Gates, I have found him resistant to self-reflection. He’d often mock my attempts to engage him in a deep biographical mode by making flip comments or dodging the question. But in this book—his fifth—released this February, there are about 300 pages of Bill Gates’ personal journey, told in a somewhat unsparing first person.\nAs he paints it, Gates’ Seattle childhood hit all the notes of a ’50s sitcom, with loving, devoted parents and the trappings of the American Dream. But the family dynamic was fraught, often because of Gates’ personality quirks. His own father once told me that Gates’ mom found their son’s behavior “traumatic”—he refused to submit to his parents’ wishes that he do his homework, listen to simple requests, or even speak to them. With his family, his teachers, and his fellow students, Gates rejected the social contract. He cracked jokes or responded with sarcasm and his favorite phrase, “That’s the stupidest thing I ever heard!” (Those words would later be as familiar to his employees at Microsoft as they were in the hallways of Seattle’s Lakeside School.)\nAt Lakeside, Gates learned that actually studying for class could pay dividends, and that acting in a school play was a great way to get to know popular girls (though one turned him down for a prom date). Most importantly, he discovered that a computer terminal could open up a world to him—and ultimately, with his software, to hundreds of millions of others.\nGates’ description of how he and his friend Paul Allen cofounded Microsoft is a more familiar tale. It was the subject of my very first interview with Gates in April 1983, and in my book Hackers I told the story (as did others) of how, when Gates was 19, the pair created the first version of the BASIC computer language that ran on a microcomputer. But reading Gates’ side of the early Microsoft saga is illuminating. He explains why after commandeering a 60 percent stake in the company, he later browbeat Allen into accepting the butt end of a 64-36 split. Gates says he now feels badly about how he handled it, but that the arrangement reflected who was working harder and making more decisions. (In his own autobiography, Idea Man, Allen would write that the incident “exposed the differences between the son of a librarian and the son of a lawyer.”)\nGates and I met at the Washington, DC, office of Breakthrough Energy, an organization he founded in 2015 to help fund climate tech. The former teenage hellion—who once joked with a friend how crazy it would be to accumulate a $15 million fortune—is now a 69-year-old world-famous centibillionaire and a divorced granddad with his own complex family dynamic. He is respected by the global health establishment and literally demonized by anti-vaxxers and tinfoil paranoids. He has been interviewed thousands of times and sits stone-faced as he mics up for our session. But as he reimmerses himself in the past, he soon is rocking gently—and cracking jokes.\nI know you’ve been thinking of an autobiography for decades. But I didn’t expect you to write a book about your childhood.\nIt’s a project I’ve been working on for some time. But it was only about 18 months ago that I decided to do a book on this first phase of my life—the 25 years up to the start of Microsoft—where my parents, my upbringing, and the luck I was exposed to were the whole story. Once that idea came up, I got quite enthused. It was really fun to try and explain how amazing my father was, my mother, my sisters. And how I found myself more enmeshed in programming than almost anyone by the time I’m about 20 years old.\nThis is very much a bildungsroman, your coming-of-age story. You hold a mirror to yourself. Sometimes the mirror doesn’t portray such a flattering image.\nIt’s not the Immaculate Conception. I had my ups and downs. There was the time I brought friends to the Harvard lab and used a computer, and they were confused about what I was doing. [He was later admonished for improper use of the lab.] Microsoft’s first customer was MITS, and we ended up in a dispute with them. It’s hopefully a very human story.\nIt is a human story. I remember doing a profile of you in 1999, and your father told me that your mother was traumatized by your behavior. You wouldn’t talk for days on end. As you say in the book, the things that really interested you were reading and math and being inside your own head. In some ways you weren’t kind to your parents, and you express remorse for this.\nI give my parents a lot of credit for how they shaped me. My dad was much more setting an example, always being serious about his work. With my mom, it was far more intense. I was often falling short. “Oh, you didn’t get up here as soon as I wanted, or your table manners weren’t as good as I wanted.” She was always pushing me to do better. Eventually she was proud of what I achieved, but that was a complex relationship.\nThey were at their wits’ end with you, and took you to a therapist. At the end of the book you said that if you had grown up in this era, you probably would have been diagnosed on the autism spectrum. What led you to that conclusion?\nBack then, the idea that kids were very different and needed some kind of intervention wasn’t commonplace at all. I was clearly somewhat hyperactive. I could concentrate a great deal. This guy, Dr. Cressey, really got me thinking about what I was trying to achieve in this conflict with my parents. Did I really have some thought in mind, or was I just trying to make trouble? I think the fact I did get to see that therapist was good. Who knows what it would have been like if I’d been diagnosed? Kids now are much more looked over. I was able to go off to the computer center or spend all that time alone, even going out on hikes.\nI couldn’t believe how you and your preteen friends went on epic, dangerous, multi-day hikes.\nNow you’d have a GPS tracker.\nVery late in the book you acknowledge how much privilege is part of your story. You say that you were advantaged as a white male, and your family was well off. But in a sense your life is charmed. Everyone is watching out for you. At several points your father swoops in to give you legal help. Teachers went out of their way to take an interest in you. People had your back at every turn.\nI was so lucky in those things. I had at least five or six teachers who saw a spark in me and really engaged with me. My parents were well off, but compared to the kids at this private school I’d say we were below average. They had bigger houses and they had wealth. [This wasn’t apparent to Paul Allen, who wrote in his book, “Bill came from a family that was prominent even by Lakeside standards … I remember the first time I went to Bill’s big house a block or so above Lake Washington, feeling a little awed.”] I actually had a little chip on my shoulder—“Hey, you guys, your parents gave you a car and you didn’t have to work in the summer.” But you could hardly design a better childhood, you know—including a time-sharing computer terminal showing up at the school when I’m 13 years old.\nYou recount how you acted like the class clown and often responded to people by being, as you diplomatically say, a “smart aleck.”\nLook, there’s a certain clever-boy shortcut use of sarcasm that allows you to communicate efficiently. That whole kind of sparring can be funny. At Harvard, that was my go-to approach, my whole way of engaging with people—procrastination, and being super clever and sarcastic while tearing somebody’s argument apart. The underlying skill is actually worthwhile, but I tended to break those habits later, knowing when not to deploy it. That kind of dialog doesn’t work when you’re managing people.\nWell, I’m thinking about the deposition you gave as a billionaire CEO before the trial for antitrust—you behaved just like a smart aleck kid!\nYou think I was a smart aleck? That lawyer, now that’s a smart aleck!\nMalcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers says that it’s possible to explain why some people are special. They practice at their special skill for 10,000 hours and are alive at the perfect time for their expertise to matter. You certainly spent more than 10,000 hours programming, and the time was right. But that’s true of a lot of people. And there is only one Bill Gates. I can’t crack the code for what makes a person extraordinary. Have you thought about that?\nIt’s not just the circumstances, though that’s gigantic. Yes, there’s still a few million kids who are in the same loop as I am. But through my father I saw the common sense of business. In my early engagement with Digital Equipment Corporation, which was this vaunted company, people embraced me and gave me reinforcement. And there’s something about my desire to succeed using my skill set. My friend Kent Evans helped really cement that.\nHe was your best friend, and more focused on his ambition than you were, reading business magazines as a teenager. His accidental death at age 17 haunts this book, and your life.\nKent helped shape me as a forward-looking person. And then Paul was reading about chip stuff, and he showed it to me. He was two years ahead of me but he sought me out.\nPaul also gave you LSD. Steve Jobs once said that LSD was a formative experience and opened his mind in a way that helped him with creativity and design. I don’t get the impression that taking acid was life-changing for you.\nI think the batch that Steve got must have really been good for product design and marketing. My God, just think if I’d had that batch! Yeah, I did some crazy things when I was young. Paul deserves some credit for that. By the time we got serious about work, we weren’t doing that anymore.\nYou also briefly write about the famous time you got busted for speeding. Were you freaked out by spending a night in jail?\nNo, it was just kind of a funny thing. They thought it was strange that somebody so young had a nice car—what was the story with this kid? Was I a drug dealer or something?\nYou bought yourself a Porsche in your early twenties.\nI clearly didn’t fit their normal pattern. We kept enough cash around that Paul was able to come down and bail me out.\nSpeaking of cash, on the recent Netflix series you host, you did an episode about inequality. You didn’t condemn the idea of billionaires but advocated for more equality. How would that work?\nThe world economy has created some hyper-rich people. Like me. And maybe 50 or 60 others. Elon Musk is at the head of that list, but with Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Ballmer, Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg, there’s a lot of people with a stunning level of wealth. I think that’s OK. I would have a much more progressive tax system, so I would have about a third as much money as I have. It would still be a gigantic fortune.\nThe New York Times reported that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is on track to avoid $8 billion in estate taxes. When you read that, did you think, “I should consult his tax lawyer”? Or say that this is not a good thing?\nI’m quite certain I’ve paid more taxes than anyone alive—over $12 billion. There are techniques I could have used, like to borrow against my Microsoft shares and not sell them. But if people are getting away with paying less in taxes in a legal way, blaming them is a little strange. We ought to change the tax system.\nThey are culpable because they use political pressure to preserve their loopholes and cut funding for the IRS.\nThe votes of these billionaires shouldn’t influence our tax system. Also, several of the 50 hyper-rich are for more progressive taxation. I’ve been surprised that even the Democratic Party hasn’t gone very far to make tax stuff more progressive. I’m a huge defender of the estate tax, I think it’s a fantastic thing. I would make it even tougher to avoid it.\nLet’s talk about artificial intelligence. You’ve been working with it for years, but you were slow to embrace the recent transformational breakthrough of generative AI. It wasn’t until OpenAI did a demo of GPT-4 at your home and aced an AP Biology test that you became bullish on it. What was the reason for your initial skepticism?\nThe idea of AI is pervasive throughout my whole history with computers. Bizarrely, when I left Harvard to start Microsoft, one of the things I thought I might regret was that the progress in AI in academia might move quickly while I was doing BASIC interpreters. That turned out to be so wrong. I expected that when we could encode knowledge in a rich way, where it could read a biology textbook and pass the AP exam, that we would explicitly understand how we’re encoding that knowledge. Instead, we discovered a weird statistical algorithm that we don’t understand. Why does GPT work? We don’t have a clue. But when OpenAI showed me GPT-4, it stunned me that they had crossed a very important threshold. We still have reliability problems, but we have a path now where I think those will all get solved.\nSam Altman says we will have AGI in the next few years. Do you agree?\nAbsolutely.\nWhat will that mean for us?\nAnybody who analogizes this to electricity, tractors, microcomputers, they don’t get it. This is not a productivity aid for humans. This is something that exceeds human capability. It is not bounded in any way, and it is happening very, very quickly. Just looking back on previous tech revolutions and saying, “OK, that all worked out,” is no guide for this one.\nDo we need to regulate it?\nRegulation will call for certain liability, for quality benchmarks. But the main thing people should say is, should we slow it down? It’s very hard to think how you would do that. Whenever somebody in the US says, OK, let’s regulate it, people say, “Well, what about other countries like China?” The key fact is, we don’t have a mechanism to slow it down.\nWe’re also developing weapons with it—there’s a literal arms race for lethal weapons controlled by AI. Do you think that’s a good idea?\nTake what Elon essentially said about the F-35 fighter jet—having a human in it is value subtracted. He’s right. So if you use the logic of, “OK, I want to make the best airplane weapon,” AI is the state of the art.\nWhat’s your relationship with the new administration? In an earlier interview, you told me that Donald Trump urged you and Anthony Fauci to meet with RFK Jr.\nWe did meet with him, and we discussed vaccine safety. It was four people—Robert Kennedy, [former National Institutes of Health director] Francis Collins, Tony Fauci, and myself—and we spent two and a half hours.\nAre you excited that he has been named to head the Department of Health and Human Services?\nDoes he end up taking the job or not? There are people excited that he is willing to shake things up. If you shook it up the right way, maybe it could be better. But I think the National Institutes of Health works very well the way it is. So my counsel, if they are at all interested, is to not be too radical in changes to the NIH. But they’re in charge. At the very least, it’s going to be an interesting period.\nAren’t you terrified that an anti-vaxxer is going to be in charge of vaccines?\nIt’s hard to know. Many radical things get said, and very few radical things get done. In the world of health you have to have an outcome. Are you helping to make people healthy or not? The Foundation’s unique point of view is that we want to help the health of people all over the world, including in poor countries. The thing that I’m most worried about is, will the health needs of the poorest, particularly in Africa, continue to be a priority? The desire to reduce the deficit makes us have to stick up for those things even though the stuff I’m trying to stick up for is only like half a percent of the budget.\nElon might think that’s a waste of money.\nI am worried about the relationship between the United States and the World Health Organization, since various people and politicians had complaints about the WHO during the pandemic. That should all be talked through. But I hope the US doesn’t defund WHO, because they play a very important role in coordinating things when there is a health emergency and preventing a pandemic. [In his first week in office—after this interview took place—President Trump announced that the US would leave the WHO.]\nAre you going to make nice with the Trump people?\nThey’re the government of the United States. So I would say yes.\nLet’s finish with the way you end your book. You write that sometimes you wish you were still that 13-year-old kid living inside your own head and driven by curiosity. With all your success, you really want to roll back the tape?\nI’m not saying I want to go back and change something. I’ve been so lucky. But it was amazing to live through all that. I do miss that wonderful feeling where the whole thing was in doubt. There were days when I thought, “Oh, we are so messed up, and other people are ahead of us.” And, “Who do we think we are to have these wild dreams?” But step by step, we built this incredible thing.\nDo people really change?\nNo. I think you moderate, you become wiser, and you grow. But I’m still 95 percent that same person.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

There’s an official Barbie-branded G-Shock on the way.\nCasio has announced the watch as part of its 2025 lineup, and it’s every bit as bright, bold, and pink as you might imagine it to be … even if it isn't quite as out there as the Impala x Barbie Lightspeed inline skates.\nIt’s based on the popular GMA-S110 watch, a smaller version of the industrial-styled GA-110 that launched in 2010, and features a watch face that layers a number of small components to create a three-dimensional design.\nIn the GMA-S110BE, as the Barbie edition will be known, each of these components has a slightly different pink hue, along with some subtle themed variations. This includes a Barbie logo at 3 o’clock and a heart motif indicator on the inset dial at 9 o’clock.\nThe logo features again on the matching pink strap, while the case back is engraved with Barbie's trademark side profile silhouette.\nAway from the Barbie theme, you can expect all of the features of a regular GMA-S110, which means it is a mixed digital and analog watch, with 29 time zones across 48 cities. It features a shock-resistant structure, with 200-meter water resistance, and the option for five daily alarms, a 1/1,000-second stopwatch and countdown timer, plus an auto LED light.\nIt joins a trio of other pink-hued G-Shock watches launching this year —the GMA-P2100PP, GMD-S5610PP, and the GMA-S140PP—and Casio isn’t alone in betting big on pink once again in 2025. Oris has just announced the ProPilot X Miss Piggy Edition, for example, with its bright pink watch face taking its inspiration from everyone’s favorite Muppets diva (as well as a spyhole on the caseback revealing the character’s glamorous portrait), while Bremont has also launched the Terra Nova 38 in an eye-catching bubblegum pink—limited to 250 pieces.\nWhether this continuing penchant for pink is due to the Barbie effect, 18 months on from the movie's release, it's hard to be sure—but it feels unlikely. However Casio is clearly hoping that the Barbie branding still has some stiletto-wearing legs in it yet. Danielle Thom, the curator of the Design Museum's Barbie exhibition thinks its cross-generational pull is timeless.\n“A key reason for Barbie's appeal as a collaborator is the longevity of the brand, having been a dominant cultural presence since 1959,” she tells WIRED. “Rightly or wrongly, Barbie is also associated with a well-defined set of assumptions and values—femininity, accessible glamour, empowerment, and friendship. Any brand collaborating with Barbie can expect some of that magic to transfer over.”\nThe GMA-S110BE will be available in the US and Europe in March.",

    "content_text": "The recent installation of Elon Musk ally Thomas Shedd atop the federal IT structure has thrown an agency in charge of servicing much of the US government’s technical infrastructure into disarray.\nOver the last few days, workers at the Technology Transformation Services (TTS), which is housed within the General Services Administration (GSA), have been summoned into what one source called “sneak attack” meetings to discuss their code and projects with total strangers—some quite young—who lacked official government email addresses and have been reticent to identify themselves. TTS workers have also received confusing transition guidance and a sudden DC office visit from Musk.\nIt was announced last week that Shedd, who previously worked as a software engineer for eight years at Tesla, Musk’s electric car company, would be the new TTS director. In emails to TTS staff, Shedd reinforced the Trump administration’s commitment to cutting costs and maximizing efficiency—something Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has been charged with carrying out.\nAre you a current or former employee at GSA or other government tech worker? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters at makena_kelly@wired.com or vittoria_elliott@wired.com. You can also contact them more securely on Signal at makenakelly.32 or velliott88.18.\n“I’ve spent my entire career in Silicon Valley,” Shedd wrote in an introductory email to staff last Thursday and obtained by WIRED. “If we work together and execute well we will be able to navigate the policies, leverage our technical expertise and be a critical part of accelerating technology adoption across agencies to enable great gains in efficiency.”\nTTS helps develop the platforms and tools that underpin many government services, including analytics tools and API plugins that agencies can use to deploy tech faster. This means that the group has access to troves of government data and systems across agencies. That access is useful for standardizing the many, not always interoperable, systems that the federal government uses, but could also provide invaluable information to a private company or be weaponized against government employees and citizens.\nEarly Wednesday morning, rumors began to spread at TTS that employees would be receiving surprise one-on-one meeting notifications from management. During these brief meetings, employees would, according to a staff email that Shedd sent later on Tuesday, be asked to identify their biggest “wins” and the most significant “blockers” preventing them from working as efficiently as possible. The email linked to a Google Form questionnaire for employees to fill out ahead of their scheduled meetings. The invites included people without official GSA email accounts who were using Gmail addresses as well as official government accounts, multiple sources told WIRED.\n“These should be items that you completed,” a screenshot of the form obtained by WIRED said. “It is OK to have a mix of big projects and small wins (examples: fixed a critical bug, shipped XYZ feature, saved this amount on a renegotiated contract, ect [sic] … If you are an engineer or designer please include a link to a PR [pull request] or a screenshot of one of your wins from the past 3 months.”\nThe email is reminiscent of one that Musk sent early in his Twitter days, demanding that employees email a one-page description of what they had accomplished the previous month and how it differed from their goals.\nRather than convening with Shedd in these meetings, TTS employees were instead surprised to be met with people they had never seen or worked with before.\n“It was a very confusing call because I expected to be meeting you, and I was instead met by two people reluctant to identify themselves,” one TTS employee told Shedd in an open Slack channel, one of several reviewed by WIRED. “They had not seen the information I submitted in my form, so I was left trying to explain things without the visuals/links I had submitted,” one wrote.\n“Also had the same exact experience,” another employee added. “The individual I had met with had no idea about the google form I submitted and when I did reference it, I was met with avoidance.”\nIn a Slack message to TTS staff on Thursday morning viewed by WIRED, Shedd apologized for the vague and sudden meeting invites, and for including unnamed individuals in the meetings who joined with Gmail addresses.\n“They are each in the onboarding process of obtaining a GSA laptop and PIV card. I take full responsibility for the actions of each of them in the calls. I’ve asked them to start the calls with their first name and confirming that they are an advisor to me,” Shedd said in a screenshot of the Slack message viewed by WIRED.\nShedd told employees that the people on the calls were “vetted by me, and invited into the call.” He said they were physically present with him at the GSA headquarters, and that he had “badged them all into the building.” This implies that those joining the calls did not currently have official government IDs issued to agency staff.\nAt least two of these individuals appeared to be “college students with disturbingly high A-suite clearance,” one TTS source told WIRED. (A-suite clearances tie employees to the GSA administrator’s office.)\nOne person says they were brought into a review with Edward Coristine, a recent high school graduate who spent several months at Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company, whom WIRED has previously identified as a person working at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and reporting directly to its new chief of staff, the former xAI employee Amanda Scales. He has not responded to requests for comment from WIRED, and OPM has declined to comment.\n“We do not have any additional personnel announcements at this time.” a GSA spokesperson told WIRED on Thursday.\nIt’s typical for TTS workers to work in tandem with other agencies across government, with many of their projects containing data external to GSA and subject to sensitivity agreements. Being required to share specific technical achievements, though, spooked some employees who feared they could breach these agreements.\n“The team is correct in feeling nervous sharing details about other agencies in these calls and should continue to follow the normal guidance which is to not share sensitive information,” Shedd wrote in the GSA Slack on Thursday. “The point of these calls is to talk through interesting example problems/wins and dig into how that win was realized. A chance for you to brag about how you solved a problem.”\nThis week, it appears that TTS has become the primary target of these meetings, but members of the US Digital Services—which a Trump executive order has rebranded as Musk’s DOGE—also met with management to go over their recent work last week. The DOGE meetings were conducted similarly in structure to the TTS ones, according to The Washington Post.\nLike many other agencies, GSA has been making changes to DEI initiatives that have put workers on edge. On January 23, TTS deputy director Mukunda Penugonde announced that as part of the GSA’s new initiative to curtail DEIA programs, the agency would be shutting down its “Diversity Guild meeting series” and the “#g-diversity Slack channel effective today,” in an email reviewed by WIRED.\nMusk was seen at the GSA office near the White House on Thursday, but it’s unclear what he was doing there. Shedd was scheduled to lead a meeting with around 40 TTS program supervisors Thursday afternoon. On Wednesday, WIRED reported that Musk has been telling his friends that he’s been sleeping at the DOGE office in DC.\nOf all parts of the government, TTS, perhaps even more so than DOGE, is well positioned to get inside agencies’ technology and data, including government spending data, explaining why it’s such a focus for the new administration.\n“TTS represents the consolidation of 20-plus years of tech and data expertise, brought together by the hard work of hundreds (if not thousands) of civil servants,” Noah Kunin, a cofounder of 18F, a team of designers and engineers within the GSA that help government agencies build and deploy new tech products, and a former infrastructure director at GSA, tells WIRED. “They have the products, platforms, and people to do this work right, within the confines of current law, and fast.”",

    "content_text": "On Thursday morning, President Donald Trump appeared to place the blame for a midair collision that killed 67 people on the previous administration’s approach to hiring aviation professionals. But experts and investigators involved with the crash, which also involved a military helicopter, say the next few weeks will see investigators pore over every element of the crash, and the moments leading up to it, to determine the causes.\n“You need to give us time,” Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, said at a press conference Thursday. The NTSB is an independent US federal watchdog agency that is leading the investigation into the crash. “We have data, we have substantial amounts of information,” she said. “We need to verify information.”\n“We Will Analyze the Facts”\nOn Wednesday evening, a US Army Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter collided with the tail of a Bombardier CRJ-700 jet coming in for landing at Washington, DC’s Ronald Reagan National Airport. Officials say no one on board either the military helicopter or the commercial airliner, operated by the regional airline PSA Airlines on behalf of American Airlines, survived the crash. It is the deadliest US commercial airline crash in 16 years.\nIn a White House briefing Thursday morning, Trump pointed to a program that also existed through his first administration aimed at expanding the talent pool for the US Federal Aviation Administration to individuals with disabilities. There was no proof, he admitted, that the crash was linked to the FAA’s attempts to improve diversity in its workforce. But he made the connection, he said, “because I have common sense and unfortunately some people don’t.”\nLater on Thursday, the White House released a statement criticizing the Biden administration’s “rejection of merit-based hiring” at the FAA in favor of a hiring program that encouraged diversity. Trump also ordered the FAA and the US secretary of transportation to review all of the FAA’s hires and safety protocol changes made during the four years of the Biden administration, “and to take such corrective action as necessary to achieve uncompromised aviation safety,” which might include firings.\nBut experts and the investigators say a thorough and unbiased approach will be critical to determining exactly why and how the collision occurred.\nIn a press briefing, NTSB board member J. Todd Inman said at least seven different working groups will focus on different elements of the flights, made up of federal investigators as well as representatives from the military, aircraft manufacturers, and organizations representing aviation professionals.\nAn operations group will look into the history of the accident and the crew involved. Another group will focus on the body of the aircraft, examining the wreckage and accident scenes to determine what course the aircraft traveled before the collision, including the altitude. Another will zoom in on the engines involved. Others will examine onboard hydraulic, electrical, and pneumatic systems, as well as flight control instruments. A group will look specifically at the role of air traffic control, using recordings and sensor data to determine how professionals at National Airport reacted to the incident. Another will examine the reactions of first responders, and another will examine the helicopter in particular. A “human performance” group will be embedded within several of those organizations, focusing on what role crew fatigue, workload, medication, equipment, and training might have played in the collision.\nInman said the groups would produce a preliminary report on the crash in at least 30 days, but they would surface any pressing issues that might affect wider air safety as soon as they appear. “We will help find out what happened, and we will do it factually and accurately,” he said.\nAfter about a year, the NTSB will likely release a more in-depth report that includes recommendations for the entire air safety system. Officials at the FAA will then choose which of these recommendations to accept and implement.\n“Unbiased Minds”\nLooking at every part of a crash is standard operating procedure for crash investigations, says Daniel Kwasi Adjekum, who teaches aviation safety as a professor at the University of North Dakota. “In investigations, you should always have an unbiased mind,” he says. “You look at everything and rule it out.” That approach is critical, he says, to preserving the credibility of nonpolitical crash investigations. The taint of bias “makes it hard to call for substantial changes” after a tragic crash, he says.\n“Anybody who is rushing to judge or find fault right now is completely inappropriate,” says Michael McCormick, a former vice president of the FAA’s Air Traffic Organization who now coordinates the air traffic management program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “Now is the time to allow the professionals to do their jobs.”\nNo matter what investigators find, the DC crash will very likely lead to significant changes in the way this country operates its aviation systems, McCormick says.\n“Having a midair collision occur in a major metropolitan area while both aircraft are being guided by air traffic control is an event that’s going to generate a lot of attention, a robust investigation, and some significant changes.”\nThe last serious crash that made him feel this certain about change was the 2009 Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash, which killed 50 people outside of Buffalo, New York, and resulted in the FAA adopting new safety procedures. Before that? September 11, 2001.",

    "content_text": "Meta told investors on Thursday that it remains committed to building “an inclusive workplace” full of “cognitive diversity,” even as the social media company moves to end its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The statement was part of an annual earnings filing Meta made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in which it removed mentions of DEI-related “learning and development courses” for employees, as well as statistics on the percentage of staff who identify as disabled, LGBTQ+, or from other underrepresented backgrounds.\n“In early 2025, we announced changes to our diversity programs in light of the shifting legal and policy landscape,” Meta wrote in the filing. “We will continue to work to build an inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve.”\nThe filing, known as a 10-K, maintains language from Meta’s 2023 version about how “a broad range of knowledge, skills, political views, backgrounds, and perspectives” leads to cognitive diversity and “fuels innovation.” The world’s biggest social media company disclosed it has about 74,000 employees globally, up 10 percent from a year ago. Overall, Meta said it grew its daily active users by 5 percent to 3.35 billion in 2024, while sales increased by 22 percent to over $164 billion.\nTwo current Meta employees told WIRED they are still upset about the DEI rollbacks announced earlier this month and believe many of their colleagues share the same sentiments. Janelle Gale, the company’s vice president for human resources, said at the time that Meta was eliminating a program that aimed to ensure candidates from underrepresented groups in the tech industry weren’t overlooked in its hiring practices. Cuts were also announced to efforts that promoted Meta working with a diverse slate of outside vendors, such as businesses owned by military veterans or women, as well as to training programs designed to engender respect in the workplace among people with different backgrounds and abilities.\nMeta spokesperson Tracy Clayton declined to comment on the revisions to its SEC filing. The company did not immediately respond to a separate request for comment on the concerns raised by some employees.\nIn a note to staff earlier this month, Gale cited the changing US legal landscape that is “signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI.” She added that the term had “become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others.\"\nSome Meta employees say they have yet to notice any impacts internally. “I’m not convinced they are going to do anything at all. Could just remove mention of it and move on,” one staffer says. But the changes, which followed the relaxation of Meta’s hate speech policies for content shared on Instagram and Facebook, remain a constant source of discussion among workers, according to one of the employees.\nMeta employees typically vote on which questions executives should address at companywide meetings. Ahead of such a gathering scheduled for Thursday, several of the most-endorsed questions were related to DEI. But Meta leadership have told employees that the popularity of a certain question no longer guarantees that it will be answered by company leadership, according to one of the employees. The New York Times earlier reported the change.\nA number of US companies, including in the tech industry, removed mentions of diversity goals and programs in their annual filings about a year ago amid growing public criticism of the initiatives in the form of civil lawsuits and pressure from activist investors. A new round of cutbacks have been announced by retailers, restaurants, manufacturers, and tech developers as President Donald Trump returned to the White House this month.\nTrump has repeatedly criticized DEI policies and programs, calling them “nonsense” and “discriminatory.” After he was inaugurated on January 20, Trump quickly moved to end DEI programs at agencies across the federal government.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has sought to warm his once-frosty relationship with the president over the past few months. On Wednesday, Meta and Trump reached an agreement to settle a lawsuit Trump filed over the temporary suspension of his user account after the January 6 Capitol insurrection, according to a federal court filing. Meta agreed to pay about $25 million, with most of the funds going toward Trump’s future presidential library, The Wall Street Journal reported. Dani Lever, a Meta spokesperson, confirmed the reporting to WIRED. Trump’s attorneys in the case did not respond to requests for comment.\nZuckerberg didn’t acknowledge the settlement on the company’s quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, but did applaud the president. “We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad,” he said. “And I am optimistic about the progress and innovation that this can unwind.”\nAt Meta, the effect of the DEI cuts may be muted, in part, because the company has been working on trimming them for some time behind the scenes, according to a former Meta employee directly familiar with the changes. “It’s been a slow, painful death,” they say. After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, then chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg spearheaded the company’s increased commitments to diversity, including commissioning an internal civil rights audit. In its 2022 diversity report, Meta noted that it had doubled the number of women and Black staff members since 2019 as part of its diversity goals.\nWith Sandberg’s support, the former Meta employee says, “there was like this huge rush of energy to make a difference.” But in July 2022, Sandberg announced her departure from day-to-day operations at the company. Around that same time, the tech giant announced that it would start identifying teams to let go during upcoming widespread layoffs, which took place several months later. The eventual cuts affected some 11,000 people and were the first blow to Meta’s progress on diversity, the former employee alleges.\n“Managers who were on these DEI teams were forced to either convert to non-manager roles or move to other teams that weren’t DEI. Teams with DEI in their names were disbanded,” the former employee says. They further allege that after the layoffs, Meta stopped hosting quarterly leadership meetings to discuss progress on DEI goals.\nAsked about these allegations, Meta’s Clayton says the layoffs affected employees across the company.\nGot a Tip?\nDiversity advocates maintain that investing in DEI programs helps businesses perform better financially. Some companies, including Microsoft, have not announced recent changes to DEI programs or amended related sections in their SEC filings. This week, Netflix, one of the first major tech companies to publish its fourth quarter earnings report, bolstered its section on diversity. The company now says that it trains not only its recruiters, but also “our people leaders” on hiring “more inclusively.”\nThe streaming giant continues to state that diversity in the workplace is important to attracting subscribers. “We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen—so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve,” Netflix explains in its SEC filing. The company, which employs about 14,000 people, declined to further comment.",

Learn more.\nit wasn’t that long ago that one of Silicon Valley's most prominent and influential venture capitalists, Marc Andreessen, was a major supporter of the Democratic Party. So how did he, in such a short time, transform into a top adviser to the Trump administration? This week, we retrace Andreesen’s steps–from his early days at Netscape to his current role of “unpaid intern” at DOGE.\nYou can follow Michael Calore on Bluesky at @snackfight, Lauren Goode on Bluesky at @laurengoode, and Zoë Schiffer on Threads @reporterzoe. Write to us at uncannyvalley@wired.com.\nHow to Listen\nYou can always listen to this week's podcast through the audio player on this page, but if you want to subscribe for free to get every episode, here's how:\nIf you're on an iPhone or iPad, open the app called Podcasts, or just tap this link. You can also download an app like Overcast or Pocket Casts and search for “Uncanny Valley.” We’re on Spotify too.\nTranscript\nNote: This is an automated transcript, which may contain errors.\nMichael Calore: So, true or false? Silicon Valley is a liberal bastion.\nLauren Goode: Formerly true, currently false.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I would say the same. I feel like it's different whether you're talking to the really, really rich people in Silicon Valley or the rank-and-file workers, but there's definitely been, as New York Magazine would say, a vibe shift.\nMichael Calore: A big vibe shift, and obviously, a big part of that is the leaders of Silicon Valley, some of the CEOs and the billionaires we've been talking about on the show, and we're going to talk about another one of them today.\nLauren Goode: Let's do it.\nMichael Calore: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm Zoe Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nLauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: Today, we're talking about Marc Andreessen. He is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent venture capitalists. He's also the cofounder of the early web browser company Netscape, and until not that long ago, he was a top democratic donor, but in recent years, Andreessen has fully changed his political stripes. These days, he is an adviser to the Trump administration and has been helping recruit people from Silicon Valley to bring ideas into Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. He's even called himself the unpaid intern of DOGE.\nLauren Goode: How is he eating at night?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I feel like that's such a thing that's someone who's never been an unpaid intern would say, like, “Ha, ha, ha.”\nMichael Calore: Picture Andreessen eating a lot of ramen noodles, and I think you can get there. Now, Andreessen isn't just somebody with a long and successful career in tech. He's also a godfather-like figure in the industry who's known for setting the tone for the culture in Silicon Valley. So, how does Andreessen end up making a sharp turn toward the right in his fifties? How did he go from formerly supporting the Clintons, Gore, Kerry, and Obama, to being an essential part of Donald Trump's transition back into the Oval Office? Zoe, let's start this conversation with you. I want to ask you to tell us about Mark Andreessen's worldview.\nZoë Schiffer: Happily, and I will just say that we're going to slap a big “allegedly” onto every single comment that we make on this podcast, because in this here political climate, we should do that. OK, so I want to start by telling you about something that Mark Andreessen calls “the deal.” Have either of you heard about this?\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: Do you know what I'm talking about?\nLauren Goode: Enlighten us, please.\nZoë Schiffer: OK, so the deal is a concept that Mark Andreessen has talked about on a number of podcasts, including Honestly With Bari Weiss back in December.\nMarc Andreessen [archival audio]: The deal was somebody like me basically could start a company. You could invent a new technology, in this case, web browsers and all the other things that Netscape did. Everybody would think that that was great.\nZoë Schiffer: He says it's basically an unspoken agreement wherein if you're an entrepreneur and you make a company and that company does really, really well and you make a lot of money, and eventually you give all that money away, you are seen as an impressive figure in society and you enjoy a sterling reputation.\nMarc Andreessen [archival audio]: And then at the end of your career, you would be left with this giant pot of money, and then what you would do is donate it to philanthropy. That washes away all of your sins, reclassifies you as from a sort of suspect business mogul to a virtuous philanthropist, and that's the arc, and it's all great and wonderful.\nZoë Schiffer: And also, part of the deal is that you're a Democrat and you support Democratic causes. You accept the fact that you are going to be taxed at a pretty high rate, but it's kind of all worth it because, again, you're enjoying enormous wealth and people look up to you.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, and he talks often about the fact that you're just making so much money that you're not even really thinking about taxes and you're not even really thinking about the last chapter of your life. You're just collecting 10X profits on everything.\nLauren Goode: Is the idea that you have this sterling reputation predicated on the fact that you are giving your money away? What happens if you're just a billionaire who hoards it?\nZoë Schiffer: I think that in his mind, it's like society treats entrepreneurship as a good. Capitalism isn't seen as an evil, and so you're already kind of an impressive figure in society, but then the fact that you're giving some of this money away kind of ensures that when you die, everyone's like, look at what an incredible person that was.\nLauren Goode: Got it. OK.\nZoë Schiffer: Except he says that during Obama's second term, this starts to break down a little bit. Marc takes pains to say that he actually supported and voted for Obama. He really liked him during his first term. You guys will remember that Obama's campaign had used social media pretty effectively to bring him to the White House, and this was also around the time of the Arab Spring. So the tech industry was getting a lot of positive coverage for its perceived influence on democratic revolutions around the world, but suddenly, the vibe inside the tech companies, and particularly some of the companies that Marc invested in and was really involved in starts to shift, because employees are coming in and they're asking really pointed questions to the executive team. They're getting really mad about the tech companies working with the government on AI projects, and drones, and things that they feel like run counter to the liberal ethos of Silicon Valley. Marc starts to feel, along with a lot of other tech elites, that there's this sense that suddenly they're not seen as the good guys. If you're a white man, a capitalist, those are evil words, and he feels like everyone's essentially turning on him.\nLauren Goode: So is the deal referring to this time period that includes Obama's first term in the early 2010s?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I think the deal is the unspoken agreement that used to be in place for entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, and then the deal broke down and there was this big vibe shift where it was like you doing all of the things that a successful entrepreneur was supposed to do were suddenly seen as bad things.\nMarc Andreessen [archival audio]: Then the thing that really shook me was when I realized that the philanthropy was being redefined as evil.\nZoë Schiffer: Then he actually cites the fact that Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan were going to give away 99 percent of their wealth, a fact that they would've been lauded for historically, but suddenly they're being criticized.\nMarc Andreessen [archival audio]: They just got hammered with criticism and attacks on that, and the line of argument was literally, oh, they're just slimy rich people, and they're only doing it for the tax break.\nZoë Schiffer: To Marc Andreessen, he's like, whoa, the deal has completely broken down, and so this is what started to change his worldview.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, completely.\nZoë Schiffer: When Trump is elected in 2016, there is this kind of major reckoning in Silicon Valley. The public people in Washington and tech employees felt like social media was to blame for Trump's rise specifically, because these companies hadn't done enough to combat disinformation and foreign influence. Honestly, the research I've looked at suggests that just isn't really true. Those things are just less influential than people previously believed, and Marc Andreessen and others definitely didn't buy it at the time either. Andreessen starts to feel like he was lied to by the media. His views really start to shift.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, it's interesting, Zoë, that you say that. I think we all thought that social media was definitely to blame for that time period. I happened to listen to the Upstream podcast when we were preparing for this episode, and Andreessen went on that podcast a couple of years ago to talk about how that time period around 2015, 2016, how it, I'm quoting, “broke his mental model of the world.” He says that things started to change for him as far back as 2012 when he says that people in authority started saying things that just didn't make sense to him. Then with Trump winning the nomination and the general election in 2016, also he mentions Charlottesville, the George Floyd moment, January 6th, 2021, basically, a whole bunch of events in society that changed the political spectrum. He does say, “Look, as you get older, you don't know if it's the world changing or you are changing,” but basically, he lost all faith in his ability to understand politics. It's funny because I think we talked about this in the Sam Altman episode too. He did what rich men with some extra time do, which is he went on a reading journey.\nMarc Andreessen [archival audio]: So, I decided to read my way out in both directions, both all the way out to the left, all the way to Lenin and Marx and communism on the one hand, and then all the way out to the right on the other hand, and see if I could at least reconstruct a worldview for at least some sense of context for what's happening today.\nLauren Goode: At that time, this is 2022, when he did this Upstream interview, he says he's somewhere in the middle. He acknowledges that he's a prime beneficiary of globalization, says he also works in an industry that's been incredibly enriched by immigration, but you can also get a sense from this podcast at this time that he's starting to get tired of some of the messaging and the social demands of the left.\nZoë Schiffer: I feel like we're going to get trolled for talking a lot about other podcasts on our podcast, but let me just say that it is journalism to listen to these extremely long interviews. Oh, my gosh, we're not just looking at the clips.\nLauren Goode: I know. Can I just say, I used to really enjoy my walks along Ocean Beach and now I'm just like, well, let me pull up another three-hour podcast.\nMichael Calore: Honestly, if you're going to get inside of the mind of somebody like Marc Andreessen who is constantly thinking about 18 different things at once, then listening to him talk for a couple of hours is a good way to get a very complete picture of where his mind is at.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, absolutely, or at least as complete of a picture as we're likely to get.\nMichael Calore: So, through the Biden administration, Marc Andreessen was meeting with the White House in his capacity as a venture capitalist in order to help steer government regulation into territory that would be more favorable to his investments, and things really started to shift with his relationship with Biden. Were there specific issues that they weren't seeing eye to eye on?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, for sure, but one thing that has really stuck out to me when we've been listening to Marc Andreessen talk about these meetings and the issues that they were fighting over is, I guess it's obvious that billionaires meet with high-ranking government officials, but every time I hear it, I'm like, oh, wow, I guess that is how the world works. They're just sitting down talking about their grievances. They get the direct line to the White House.\nLauren Goode: They're talking about memecoins, basically.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, that's what they do. Literally though, Lauren, that seems to be what's happening. So yeah, the three areas that the Biden administration and the Marc Andreessens of the world seemingly really do not see eye to eye on are content moderation, crypto, and AI. So, with content moderation, Mark Zuckerberg has talked about this a lot recently, but there's this sense that the Biden administration is calling tech companies, putting pressure on them, this is actually called job owning, to take down posts or suppress certain narratives. Marc Andreessen, he's implied that he's quite uncomfortable with this. Then with the crypto industry in particular, Marc says that the Biden administration starts a terror campaign against crypto, and this is obviously personal, because his venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has 7.6 billion in crypto assets, and Biden's doing things like issuing executive orders, directing federal agencies to assess the risks of crypto. He appoints SEC chair Gary Gensler, who ramps up crypto enforcement actions pretty significantly, and then the real breaking point is with AI, so leading into the 2024 election between Biden and Trump, Marc Andreessen again has these closed-door meetings, he says, with the Biden administration, and they say that they're going to get very involved in AI. They're basically, according to Marc, not going to allow AI startups to flourish, they're going to have just a few big tech companies that are doing AI, and the government will basically control them. Sam Altman has come out publicly and said this is not his view of those meetings, which he apparently maybe attended, but Marc is like, we cannot allow this to happen. We have to come out in full force for Donald Trump, and that is what he does.\nMichael Calore: Another one of Marc Andreessen's keywords is \"debanking\".” He talks about this a lot when we hear him on podcasts and he blogs about it. What is debanking? What's he talking about?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, so debanking, this is the process wherein if you're a crypto company or an entrepreneur, you're cut off from the US banking system. So, literally, you'll have a bank account and then the bank will close that account. You might have to go to a cash economy, and sometimes the banks will literally say, according to Marc, that they're facing regulatory pressure from the US government, and so they need to cut off business. Of course, from the bank's perspective, they'll say that crypto has a track record of scams and fraud, and working with these companies exposes you to a lot of risks that could harm the bank and other customers, but it's a pretty personal issue for Marc Andreessen and his friends, obviously, and he says it's ruined people's lives, people that he knows specifically. He cites 30 founders backed by Andreessen Horowitz who have been debanked.\nLauren Goode: So, it sounds like what's really changed Marc Andreessen's worldview, to bring it back to Mike's original question, over the past several years … A couple things, and one is this reaction from society collectively to the incredible power and wealth of some of these tech folks and this shifting idea around tech entrepreneurs as rock stars. That's one thing, and then the second part is he just really, really doesn't like some of the regulatory efforts of this most recent administration in particular around crypto and AI.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, exactly.\nMichael Calore: All right. So, now we're up to speed on where Marc Andreessen's mind is in 2025. Let's take a break, and when we come back, we'll go back in time and examine how he got into his position of power in Silicon Valley. You're listening to Uncanny Valley.\n[break]\nMichael Calore: So, let's back up and talk about what Marc Andreessen was like at the dawn of his career. Lauren, I would like to ask you to chart the early Marc Andreessen years for us.\nLauren Goode: Well, first I'm going to start off by saying that I've listened to a lot of podcasts now with Marc Andreessen, and a signature of listening to Marc Andreessen podcasts is that you're constantly checking to see if you accidentally hit the 2X button because he talks—\nZoë Schiffer: So real.\nLauren Goode: … so fast. He says a lot, and he says it quickly. OK. Just for some context, Marc Andreessen was born in 1971. He grew up in Wisconsin. He went to the University of Illinois to study electrical engineering. He ended up switching to computer science, which was really more of his jam. He has said that basically, his timing in life has a lot to do with his success. He said in early interviews there were a couple of federally funded programs happening around the time that he went to college that really supported what became the consumer internet. One of those was the National Science Foundation's NSFNET, and his university, University of Illinois, was receiving funding through that. So he really was sort of in the right place at the right time.\nZoë Schiffer: Seems like a uniquely humble stance for a Silicon Valley billionaire to admit.\nLauren Goode: Easy to say when you're just swimming through your billions every day. You look like that guy from Breaking Bad, just sleeping on the pile of money, and then you're like, yes, I owe my success to the NSFNET grant.\nZoë Schiffer: That's big, magnanimous.\nLauren Goode: So it's while he's at the University of Illinois that he and some other people develop Mosaic. Mosaic was a web browser, and we all know what a web browser is now, but at the time, Mosaic was doing something really different. It was different from the super nerdy text-based internet systems like BBS or bulletin board systems, and it was different from the closed portals or stove-pipes, as Andreessen himself has called them, like AOL, or Prodigy, or CompuServe. Mosaic was a graphical user-friendly portal to the open web, and this really was a huge innovation at the time. This actually ends up playing into Andreessen's ideas around Little Tech, which I think we're going to talk about, because at the time, he really was the Little Tech. He has said that if Apple or Microsoft had developed the browser first, we would probably be even more entrenched in what we think of as Big Tech today, because they were Big Tech at the time and what he was trying to do was Little Tech.\nZoë Schiffer: Mike, do you remember using Mosaic?\nMichael Calore: I do. It came out while I was in college. Marc Andreessen is a few years older than me, so around the time he was leaving college, I was entering college. I remember being in school and within a matter of months, everybody went from checking their email in Pine, a text-based interface, and that's all they were using the computer for, to all of a sudden hanging out for hours, and reading news, and checking the weather, and visiting the libraries of other universities around the world who were putting their hypertext pages into this interface that you could just click and you were just using your mouse all the time to click around instead of typing commands into a keyboard. There was also graphics in Mosaic, so you could go to a page and click on something, see an image. It sounds really rote and basic now, but this was the birth of the web, and it was kind of astonishing how quickly it just flowed in, and I think it's because Mosaic was free. It was easy to get. Everybody’s sort of, “Oh, do you have the browser? You go here, you download it, you install it.” Everybody was helping each other to get onto this new system.\nZoë Schiffer: Feels like a nice era of the internet and also the beginning of the end for us. People used to just live their actual lives, and then we all started spending a shit-ton of time online and look where we are now.\nMichael Calore: They did, and I think it's hard to overstate the importance of a piece of software like the first few web browsers, because it was really an empowering technology. So, for me, in the early part of the web, Marc Andreessen was this amazing figure who brought us this wonderful gift. So, after the success of Mosaic, where did he go from there? What did he go on to do?\nLauren Goode: Well, Mosaic was built within the University of Illinois, and he really wanted to commercialize the browser. So, he ended up moving away from the Mosaic project to cofound Netscape and then called that browser the Netscape Navigator because the university owned the rights to the Mosaic name, and he ends up selling Netscape. It gets acquired by AOL. He and Jim Clark sell it for 10 billion dollars. I think the time the deal was announced in 1998, it was a $4.2 billion deal, and by the time it went through a year later, it somehow became $10 billion. So, I guess, never just take the first offer, folks. I don't know what you're supposed to take away from that, just billions of dollars in difference. So, they become very rich. I think Jim Clark was more rich, but Andreessen certainly made his millions too, and then a few years later, this is a big moment. He becomes an early investor in Facebook and he joins the board. There's one point in Facebook's history where Facebook is considering getting acquired, and Andreessen talks Zuckerberg away from this. He tells him to keep growing the company. This is quite literally where Andreessen makes billions of dollars.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, that seems like a good decision for Mark Zuckerberg.\nLauren Goode: Right, and Marc Andreessen. Good decision for all the Marks.\nMichael Calore: So, the Facebook investment is around the time that he starts getting serious about becoming a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. So what happens next?\nLauren Goode: So, in 2009, he and Ben Horowitz start a venture capital firm and they call it Andreessen Horowitz. A lot of people refer to this as a16z. That's what the firm calls itself, because it's the letter a, 16 letters, and the letter z. a16z is interesting because it is absolutely one of the premier firms of Silicon Valley. It sets a lot of the culture of the Valley. It has tens of billions of dollars invested across all kinds of companies, but it also really set new standards for how VCs interact with startup founders. I was talking with a friend recently about … We were talking broadly about workplaces where people feel supported and workplaces where there tend to be these misaligned structures, and we ended up talking about a16z and the fact that early on what they did in the Valley was create this kind of support system for founders. The partners at the firm there get really involved with some of their investments, for better or worse, because sometimes founders don't want all that meddling, but that really kind of compelled other VC firms to start thinking about these wrappers of support that they can provide when they're also giving money to a startup. Guys, this firm has everything. They have invested in every possible company you can think of, not just Facebook and Twitter, but Airbnb, Slack, Instacart, Oculus, Databricks, Lyft, Roblox, Pinterest, GitHub, OpenAI. It is crazy. They also, as Zoë mentioned earlier, have funds dedicated to crypto investments. They're very big on crypto.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, the BeamPro founder feels like a real hallmark of Andreessen Horowitz because I feel like, previously, or maybe it's just other VC firms, they'll invest in a founder that they really believe in, but then they'll bring in a professional CEO at a certain point. I feel like Andreessen Horowitz is very big on the founder is the person with the vision, and we should support them and help them grow.\nLauren Goode: Right. They might recommend a COO or a CFO that's going to take them public at some point, but yes, they really do invest in and believe in their founders. I think in some ways they all want them to feel like they're the micro celebrity of their company world, and Andreessen's own celebrity has only grown through this firm. He has a really, really strong personality. He says a lot. Like I said earlier, he talks really fast. Let me just say what Zoe said earlier too. He allegedly gives off feral vibes on the internet.\nZoë Schiffer: Exactly. It's my personal view.\nLauren Goode: He talks in podcasts about how he learned some things about management and how to handle sticky situations as he got older, but he also has gotten edgier. He tweets a lot.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: We should talk about Twitter.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. He's PMARCA on Twitter and everywhere else, and he loves Twitter because he loves stirring the pot, so to speak.\nLauren Goode: Is he actually still tweeting today? Because I haven't gone on Twitter in so long.\nZoë Schiffer: We can't know because one of the core parts of his Twitter usage is that he blocks journalists with abandon.\nLauren Goode: He's tweeting sporadically now it appears. All I can see is November 7th, 2024, November 12th, December 20th, and then another one on January 19th. So, wait, we have an update. Our producer just jumped in to say that she can see a lot more tweets, so we're not going to say her name because then Marc Andreessen is going to go block her, but apparently, I am still blocked and I can't see all the tweets. So, to me, it looks like he's tweeting sporadically, but he is still a very prolific tweeter, this guy, and for some reason that we have never quite fully understood, he started blocking journalists. Do you guys know why he blocked you?\nMichael Calore: I think just in general, Marc Andreessen is hostile towards the media. He doesn't really like to sit for interviews with people that he doesn't consider already ideologically aligned with him. From the outside looking in, that's what it looks like.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I agree with that. He really does seem to have this view that a lot of Silicon Valley now has, that the idea that you would invest all of this time and money in a startup and then one New York Times article could tank it is completely uncomfortable and unacceptable. For me personally, my old beat was labor in Silicon Valley, so I think that that was probably a no-go for me and Marc's relationship.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I'm not quite sure of the moment when I was blocked. Obviously, he's entitled to do what he wants, but it is funny to think of him as this … He is a godfather figure in Silicon Valley to a lot of people, and we write about these companies and the culture of Silicon Valley where you have people like his pal, Mark Zuckerberg, who kind of ironically now leans so heavily on the idea of free speech and opening up communication. Meanwhile, Andreessen is someone whose tweets we as journalists can't even really access directly. We see them posted elsewhere, and we sort of have a sense of where he's coming from, but that direct access to journalists is cut off in some cases.\nMichael Calore: Andreessen Horowitz famously likes to go direct, as they say. He's tweeting constantly. He is making his ideas known. He also blogs a lot. His firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has its own blog platform. The founders and other partners often seed op-eds at other publications. There are three key memos that Marc Andreessen has made. I want to call them blog posts, but really they're memos that I think we should talk about.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. On a side note, I think it's really funny that they're very anti the mainstream media, but then when they want to write on op-ed, the mainstream media is not the enemy anymore.\nLauren Goode: Well, I think the most famous one was in The Wall Street Journal, and that's the one that people cite all the time now. Software is eating the world. Mike, tell us about this one.\nMichael Calore: Yes. So, in 2011, Marc Andreessen published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. It is called “Why Software Is Eating the World,” and if you don't have a Wall Street Journal subscription, you can just read this on the Andreessen Horowitz website, because it's also published there. It was written in 2011 at a time that is really an interesting time for Silicon Valley, because it's a few years after the financial crisis. It's also a few years after the launch of the iPhone, but it is before many of the big technological revolutions that we know happened in the 2010s. What he posits is that technology has reached the point where you can run a big company completely online, and all of the next big companies are going to maintain their dominant positions in the marketplace through software. So, the world is moving from the physical world of business into software as a service, and he says this is going to create a fundamental shift in the world economy, because all of these big companies are going to be doing their business online. They're all going to be using cloud computing, and it's going to just change the structure of how business works in the world. It's kind of fascinating to read it now, 14, 15 years later, because he was right. If you look at what happened after that memo came out, Netflix basically ate Blockbuster, and then it completely changed the way that we consume content through our televisions. Airbnb ate the hotel industry. Uber ate the taxi service and car service industry, and you can just look at a lot of examples where software did actually take over a complete sector of the business.\nLauren Goode: Mike, when you were going back and reading this and acknowledging that he was right, did it change the way you thought about Marc Andreessen from a decade ago? Because we're obviously coming into this today talking about this very particular political moment, but going back to Netscape and Mosaic and early Facebook investment, and software is eating the world, he is right about a lot of things.\nMichael Calore: Yes, absolutely. I would say there are a lot of things that he says on podcasts and in his memos and on social media that I just do not agree with. He has this view of who CEOs are as people, that they're really just trying to be better people and that they're not really as concerned about profit as everybody seems to think they are. The idea that if you have any disagreements with how venture capital works and how capitalism works, that you are a Marxist and you are a far-left individual. There are all these things that I'm just like, no, that's not the way the world works, man. He sees things as very black-and-white, and he sees things from his point of view, and I don't share those views, and I certainly don't look at the world the same way that he does. However, he's very smart. He completely understands how technology works in business, and he was right about a great many things. So Marc Andreessen tends to come along at these times of crisis in the country and in the world and put out these missives about how we should move forward. Lauren, I want to tee you up for this next part because I know that you want to talk about “It's time to build.”\nLauren Goode: “It's time to build.” Yeah, so this was the early pandemic era, and the whole world is in this position of being caught flat-footed by it. In the US, you all remember, we're in this place of scarcity. Where's the toilet paper, but also more critically, where are extra hospital beds and ventilators, and where are the vaccines, and also the stimulus checks and bailouts to help American enterprise and the American people? Andreessen uses these examples as framing for why America just has to build more in general, like schools and housing. He critiques the ideologies of both the left and right in this manifesto, but ultimately, he's a staunch capitalist. He says if the left can prove that the public sector can build things faster, sure, have at it, but he really believes that more solutions are going to come from the private sector. This does resonate with some people, and not a year later, a lot of the stuff he was crowing about in this April 2020 essay is no longer as much of a critical problem. America did in fact race to find solutions, particularly around the vaccines, but really these solutions were only short-term, but it is also clear from this manifesto that he still has this kind of romantic notion of capitalism, this idea that capitalism is how we take care of the people we don't know. I could see how you believe that to be true when you are this innovator directly responsible for creating jobs for millions of people you'll never actually meet, but I think we also have to acknowledge some of the societal imbalances that come from pure capitalism. But once again, this essay lands at a moment. He's really good at hitting that moment with these manifestos.\nZoë Schiffer: You know, that one sounds a lot like the Techno-Optimist Manifesto, which I really hope that I never have to talk about publicly again, but this was his most recent blog post where he talks about the idea that growth is progress, and technology is a primary driver of economic and social advancement and basically pits people who are negative about technology and growth and capitalism against people who are positive about it. Techno-optimists like Marc Andreessen believe in free markets, and he says in this blog that they, meaning techno-optimists, have a lot of enemies. He says, “Our enemies are not bad people. They are bad ideas.” The ideas that he views negatively in this are things like ESG, so environmental, social, and governance, social responsibility, tech ethics, trust, and safety. So, content moderation is kind of said quietly here, and he ends the manifesto by saying, “It's time to be a techno-optimist, and it's time to build.”\nLauren Goode: Oh, so he says, “It's time to build” in this one too?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Well, it's almost like he needs an editor just to point out there's some redundancies there.\nZoë Schiffer: No, no, no.\nMichael Calore: There's an echo. Lauren, to your point, here's a memo, a manifesto that is filled with a lot of interesting and good ideas, but that just feels misguided because the things that he's telling us to stay away from are the things that I think are a net positive for society, and he feels are a net negative for society. I think a lot of people sort of felt that way when they read this. They were like, what is this guy talking about? It felt kind of unhinged because you're talking about tearing down these things that we've set up to protect people.\nZoë Schiffer: It doesn't seem to me like he's gotten less smart. He's obviously a very smart dude, but in my reading, it definitely feels like he's become a little less tethered to the reality that regular people live in because he's not going to be impacted by Meta rolling back its commitment to trust and safety and content moderation the way other people are.\nMichael Calore: OK. I think we have a pretty clear picture of his worldview, and for anybody who wants to read more, you can follow the show notes to read all of those manifestos. Clear off a couple of days on your calendar, because you will need it. Let's take another break and we'll come back with more Uncanny Valley.\n[break]\nMichael Calore: So, before we end, we have to look forward. Marc Andreessen has his thumb on the scale in Washington. What is his relationship like with the Trump administration, and how is that going to change our future?\nZoë Schiffer: I think we're still kind of seeing how it's going to shape up. As we said at the beginning of the show, he's a close adviser to now President Trump, and he's really working to reshape the US government to be optimistic about tech, to be a techno-optimist, if you will. He's focused on deregulation, specifically with crypto and AI, and efficiency, which is a huge tenet of DOGE, Elon Musk's government project. I think on a more subtle level, although I don't know if you could call it subtle, he's resetting the culture so that being a rich capitalist is once again seen as a good thing, not a bad thing, except I don't see them giving away their money this time around. What about you guys?\nLauren Goode: It is my personal opinion that Marc Andreessen is very allegedly going to have huge influence over this administration's policies. Hot take.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. Based on his un-permanent residence at Mar-a-Lago.\nMichael Calore: Lauren, I agree with you because, as we've talked about and as history has shown, his ideas definitely do shape the way that technology and business and government all work together, and I don't see that changing, especially now that he has such a large platform.\nLauren Goode: I just think for guys like Marc Andreessen, there's probably no amount of power or land or money that's ever really enough. It's hard to say exactly what the outcome of his influence on the current administration is going to be. We're probably going to see a lot of pro-tech policies and regulations, or lack thereof I should say, that really support the tech industry. It feels like what a lot of these rich and powerful guys are very good at and have gotten very rich from is world building, and the world that they're building right now is probably great for them, but like Zoë said earlier, not really applicable to the rest of us.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Our country has just rolled back a bunch of green energy initiatives and gone hard into fossil fuels again in order to create boom times for the energy industry. That's also going to be boom times for crypto and for AI, which require a lot of computing resources. So, you can see the influence that these tech leaders, not just Marc Andreessen, but all of them who are crowding around the White House right now are having on policy, and you can see them sort of shaping the world that is going to be very beneficial towards them and their investments, to state the obvious.\nLauren Goode: Well, I don't know, Mike. How much do you have in crypto right now? Because I got to tell you, I'm going to open my Robinhood app and look at the … Did you know that you guys can also trade the Trump coin now on Robinhood?\nMichael Calore: Oh, gosh. OK. So, here's the real question that we need to answer. Is he ever going to unblock us?\nZoë Schiffer: No.\nLauren Goode: No. Don't hold your breath.\nZoë Schiffer: It depends on how many positive profiles you write about his founders I think.\nMichael Calore: Probably. I can say that I'll never know, because I'm not on X anymore, and I know that's where he primarily hangs out because that's his crowd. I hang out on the platform that he loves to make fun of, which is Bluesky. He says it's the place where all the libs go. It's the blue zone.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, we're happily in our respective echo chambers now.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: We won't have to interact.\nMichael Calore: And may it forever be thus.

He acknowledges that he's a prime beneficiary of globalization, says he also works in an industry that's been incredibly enriched by immigration, but you can also get a sense from this podcast at this time that he's starting to get tired of some of the messaging and the social demands of the left.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> I feel like we're going to get trolled for talking a lot about other podcasts on our podcast, but let me just say that it is journalism to listen to these extremely long interviews. Oh, my gosh, we're not just looking at the clips.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> I know. Can I just say, I used to really enjoy my walks along Ocean Beach and now I'm just like, well, let me pull up another three-hour podcast.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Michael Calore:</strong> Honestly, if you're going to get inside of the mind of somebody like Marc Andreessen who is constantly thinking about 18 different things at once, then listening to him talk for a couple of hours is a good way to get a very complete picture of where his mind is at.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> Yeah, absolutely, or at least as complete of a picture as we're likely to get.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Michael Calore:</strong> So, through the Biden administration, Marc Andreessen was meeting with the White House in his capacity as a venture capitalist in order to help steer government regulation into territory that would be more favorable to his investments, and things really started to shift with his relationship with Biden. Were there specific issues that they weren't seeing eye to eye on?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> Yeah, for sure, but one thing that has really stuck out to me when we've been listening to Marc Andreessen talk about these meetings and the issues that they were fighting over is, I guess it's obvious that billionaires meet with high-ranking government officials, but every time I hear it, I'm like, oh, wow, I guess that is how the world works. They're just sitting down talking about their grievances. They get the direct line to the White House.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> They're talking about memecoins, basically.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> Yeah, that's what they do. Literally though, Lauren, that seems to be what's happening. So yeah, the three areas that the Biden administration and the Marc Andreessens of the world seemingly really do not see eye to eye on are content moderation, crypto, and AI. So, with content moderation, Mark Zuckerberg has talked about this a lot recently, but there's this sense that the Biden administration is calling tech companies, putting pressure on them, this is actually called job owning, to take down posts or suppress certain narratives. Marc Andreessen, he's implied that he's quite uncomfortable with this. Then with the crypto industry in particular, Marc says that the Biden administration starts a terror campaign against crypto, and this is obviously personal, because his venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has 7.6 billion in crypto assets, and Biden's doing things like issuing executive orders, directing federal agencies to assess the risks of crypto. He appoints SEC chair Gary Gensler, who ramps up crypto enforcement actions pretty significantly, and then the real breaking point is with AI, so leading into the 2024 election between Biden and Trump, Marc Andreessen again has these closed-door meetings, he says, with the Biden administration, and they say that they're going to get very involved in AI. They're basically, according to Marc, not going to allow AI startups to flourish, they're going to have just a few big tech companies that are doing AI, and the government will basically control them. Sam Altman has come out publicly and said this is not his view of those meetings, which he apparently maybe attended, but Marc is like, we cannot allow this to happen. We have to come out in full force for Donald Trump, and that is what he does.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "A conspiracy-theory-laden conference featuring anti-vaccine speakers, including one man known for pushing toxic bleach as a cure for cancer and autism, will take place in May at the Trump National Doral Miami resort in Florida.\nThe “truth seekers” conference, held at a hotel owned and frequented by President Donald Trump, is being organized by Charlie Ward, an antisemitic conspiracy-theory peddler who lives in Spain and has a huge following online where he discusses QAnon, 9/11, the purported flatness of the earth, lizard people, and more.\nIt will be a who’s who of US anti-vaxxers and Covid deniers. The event will feature dozens of speakers, including many who led the effort to undermine the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, as well as QAnon promoters, election deniers like disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn (though his name was subsequently removed from the website promoting the event), and anti-immigrant campaigners like Christie Hutcherson, who leads Women Fighting for America.\nThe conference’s website also listed Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as a headline speaker, though the event organizer told WIRED that her presence is still not fully confirmed. Hours after WIRED contacted the organizers, her name was removed.\nAndreas Kalcker, a German man who has promoted a bleach-like solution as a cure for autism and cancer, will also be in attendance. In an interview this month on Rumble, Kalcker said he would be presenting data and testimonials from users of his solution at the conference.\nKalcker is largely viewed as the inventor of chlorine dioxide solution, also known as Water Purification Solution, Chlorine Dioxide Protocol, or MMS in other similar circles. (The letters stand for Miracle Mineral Supplement, Miracle Mineral Solution, and other similar variants.) Whatever name it goes by, it is a toxic liquid that has been peddled in alternative health circles for years as a “cure” for everything from autism to cancer, HIV/AIDS, and Covid-19. In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration warned that “ingesting these products is the same as drinking bleach.” Among the possible side effects listed are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and acute liver failure.\nKalcker has focused much of his efforts on selling the solution in Latin America, and his promotion of the toxic solution is credited with helping persuade the Bolivian government to approve it as a cure for Covid.\nIn 2021, Kalcker was charged by authorities in Argentina “with illegal practice of the medical profession and selling fake medicines,” Business Insider reported, following the death of a 5-year-old boy whose parents gave him Kalcker’s solution with the belief that it would ward off Covid.\nIt’s his presence at the conference that’s most concerning to activists who have spent years trying to highlight the dangers posed by selling the toxic bleach-like solution.\nAs the Trump administration pushes to confirm anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy to head up the Department of Health and Human Services, activists are deeply concerned that dangerous alternative health solutions, such as chlorine dioxide, could become mainstream by being associated with members of the Trump family.\nFiona O’Leary, an Ireland-based activist who has autistic children and has spent years trying to highlight the dangers of toxic bleach solution being sold as an autism cure, worries that the Miami conference will “platform” Kalcker and allow him to increase his influence in the US.\n“Andreas Kalcker has been giving bleach to autistic children for many years,” O’Leary, who has tracked Kalcker’s activities closely, tells WIRED. “Kalcker is not a doctor. His protocol for autism involves poisoning autistic children with chlorine dioxide, bleach. Autistic children are forced to drink this poison all day long and forced to suffer burning bleach enemas. It is child abuse.”\nKalcker did not respond to a request for comment.\nTickets for the two-day conference, which is taking place following a charity golf event also organized by Ward, range from $50 tickets for basic access to $2,300 VIP guests that include accommodation at the hotel and access to the speakers.\nWard, who claims to have been to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on a number of occasions, rose to prominence online in 2020 for spreading Covid-19 and QAnon conspiracy theories on YouTube before his account was banned. Now, Ward primarily livestreams on the alternative video platform Rumble, where he is a verified user and has over 200,000 subscribers. He is very well connected in Trump world: His previous guests on the show have included Flynn, former Trump adviser Roger Stone, and Trump’s current nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel.\nStuart Leary, the conference’s director, told WIRED that the majority of attendees are from the US, but up to one third of guests will travel from abroad to attend. Between 900 and 1,000 people will be attending the conference, Leary says.\nWhen asked if Eric Trump would be speaking alongside his wife, Lara Trump, Leary told WIRED he didn’t know. However in a conversation with O’Leary, the activist, a recording of which was shared with WIRED, Leary says he has “heard unofficially that two [members of the Trump family] will be there,” adding that they would not be making that public due to security concerns.\nLeigh Dundas, a California attorney who became a prominent pusher of Covid-19 conspiracies before attending the January 6 attack on the Capitol, will be in attendance, as will Sherri Tenpenny, an anti-vaxxer who shot to fame when she claimed the Covid vaccine makes you magnetic. Tenpenny also claims vaccines cause autism.\nScott McKay, known as the Patriot Streetfighter, is also slated to speak. He streams on Rumble and, in addition to promoting QAnon conspiracy theories, has inserted himself into local school board debates about mask mandates. McKay has pushed wildly antisemitic conspiracy theories in the past, including claims that Jewish people orchestrated the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as well as the assassinations of presidents Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, and William McKinley. He routinely pushes the centuries-old claim that Jewish people torture children and drink their blood.\nIn 2023, McKay was banned from speaking at another conspiracy-filled conference at Trump’s Doral resort after media reports revealed his antisemitic comments. That event was one of dozens of stops on the ReAwaken America tour, a traveling conspiracy circus organized by Flynn and filled with Christian nationalists, election deniers, conspiracy theorists, and numerous members of Trump’s own family.\nWard was also banned from that event, due to his history of spewing antisemitic and Hitler-praising social media content. Media watchdog Media Matters outlined multiple occasions where Ward’s official Telegram channel, which was subsequently deleted, posted deeply antisemitic content, including a post that said “Hitler was warning us” about Jewish people.\nWhen WIRED asked Ward about these posts, he denied making them, claiming initially that the channel referenced in the Media Matters article was a fake channel.\nWhen it was pointed out to Ward that an archived copy of his own website linked to that channel directly, and it had been promoted on his livestreams, Ward claimed that the account may have been hacked. He also claimed he had never posted anything on Telegram and that he had a team of people who did that for him.\nWard did, however, admit to saying that more people were killed by the Covid vaccine than in the Holocaust. “How many people in here know that more people have been killed by the jab than were killed in the Holocaust? And they're still doing it because nobody can stop them,” Ward said at a ReAwaken America tour stop.\nWard told WIRED that 15 million people were killed by the Covid-19 vaccine, “and that’s a fact.” This is not true. When asked for evidence to back up his claim, Ward could not provide it.\nIt appears, however, that Ward’s antisemitic comments have not damaged his relationship with the Trump organization. “Interestingly, it was Trump Doral who approached us to come for our event this year,” claims Ward. “So maybe they realize the truth.”\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the event.",

    "content_text": "Investigators are scrambling to figure out why a military helicopter and a passenger airplane collided and plunged into the Potomac River in Washington, DC, late Wednesday, the first major US air crash in 16 years.\nFrom the little that’s known, human error likely played a role, raising questions about a chronic shortage of air traffic controllers and pilots. During a press conference Thursday morning, President Donald Trump at times appeared to blame diversity programs within the Federal Aviation Administration and the helicopter’s pilots for the crash, though he admitted there were no known links between FAA hiring policies and the crash beyond “common sense.” Authorities may also be looking at coordination between military and civilian aviation.\nUS officials say an Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers plowed into the tail of a Bombardier CRJ-700 jet out of Wichita, Kansas, as the airliner was less than a mile from landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport. Video of the incident appeared to show the flaming remains of both aircraft tumble a few hundred feet into the shallow, icy river.\nThe passenger jet, which was operated by regional carrier PSA Airlines on behalf of American Airlines, had 64 people on board, and police boats have already recovered 27 bodies. Officials said Thursday morning they expect there to be no survivors. The last aircraft tragedy this deadly in the United States was the Colgan Air crash in New York state in 2009.\nIn a video released on Thursday morning, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that the helicopter was associated with the Army’s 12th Aviation Battalion, which is based less than 20 miles from DC’s national airport. The secretary said the “fairly experienced” crew was conducting a required annual night evaluation and were equipped with night-vision goggles. The identity of those on board is known, and their next of kin are being informed.\nIn a grainy video from the nearby Kennedy Center, a smaller light, presumably the helicopter, can be seen overtaking the brighter light of the plane, both of them flying low to the ground. The two collide in a massive explosion, splitting into several burning fragments.\nA few minutes before the American Airlines flight’s arrival, air traffic control asked if it could land on runway 33, a shorter runway. The pilots said yes, apparently switching runways during their approach. Some have wondered whether this change in flight path could have caught the Black Hawk off guard.\nBut retired Air Force Brigadier General John Teichert told NewsNation television that this shouldn’t have caused a crash. “I think that while they would have been told to switch runways, it’s not this aggressive maneuver in a regional jet that would prompt them to reposition and be a surprise to the Black Hawk,” he said.\nEighty percent of aviation accidents worldwide can be attributed to human error, and that is a prime candidate in this case, Marco Chan, a former pilot who now heads pilot programs at Buckinghamshire New University, told WIRED. “Perhaps safety protocols, human factors were at play,” he says. In recent years, the FAA has struggled to replace retiring air traffic controllers, even as the number of air passengers and flights rebounded after the pandemic. The FAA said last fall that it had exceeded its internal air traffic controller hiring goals for the year.\nShortly before the crash on Wednesday night, air traffic control asked the helicopter if it had seen the aircraft and told it to “pass behind the CRJ,” which would have had the right of way unless the Black Hawk was on an urgent military mission. It’s not known if the helicopter responded.\nMilitary flights sometimes operate on different radio frequencies than passenger flights, so the passenger jet’s crew may not have heard the tower radioing the Black Hawk. Or there may have been a jammed transmission: If more than one party on a channel are radioing at the same time, that can prevent others from hearing the whole conversation.\nThe airline pilots probably didn’t see the helicopter, and even if they had, it would likely have been too late, Chan says. “They would be very focused on the final approach on the actual landing on the runway. It would be very difficult to do anything at the end,” he says. “[The Black Hawk] would have been under the wing and flying toward the tail, and the pilots in the cockpit, they are at the front. It would have been very difficult for them to spot the helicopter.”\nUntil the black box recorders are retrieved from the passenger plane, it’s impossible to know for sure what the passenger pilots didn’t know or didn’t see as they came in for landing.\nSeveral hours after the accident President Trump posted on Truth Social, stating that air traffic control should have told the helicopter how to maneuver to avoid the jet. “This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented,” the president said. Trump posted again on the platform on Thursday morning, thanking emergency responders and saying he had been fully briefed and that he was monitoring the situation.\nDuring a press conference later on Thursday, the president then appeared to blame FAA diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives for the crash, though he said he didn’t have any evidence demonstrating clear links. He also seemed to ascribe the tragedy to former US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. New Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the crash “preventable.”\nAllegations of overwork and fatigue have been plaguing air travel. The number of people flying has recovered since Covid and even exceeded pre-pandemic numbers. Hiring hasn’t been able to keep up.\nAir traffic controllers are particularly understaffed. Twenty-six critical air traffic facilities are staffed below the FAA’s 85-percent threshold, according to the US Department of Transportation.\nIn July, the FAA agreed to increase mandatory rest time to 10 to 12 hours between shifts for air traffic controllers after a handful of near accidents.\nLast year, a controller cleared a FedEx plane to land on a runway in Austin, Texas, while a Southwest Airlines flight was taking off from it. Fatigue was not explicitly cited as a factor in the investigation, but controllers have complained of being overworked. “If you can’t plug the hole, if it’s only at 85 percent, someone will have to work harder,” Chan says.\nSome in the aviation industry hope that computers can take up some of the slack. A Korean company has developed a robot that can pilot planes, including military jets. There is also research into using AI to help control air traffic or pilot planes. AI could monitor fatigue among pilots or controllers, Chan says, but we’re unlikely to see a pilotless commercial plane any time soon.\n“Actual humans as pilots overseeing the operation of the computer is a safer bet at this moment,” he says.\nAdditional reporting by Aarian Marshall.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nTake it from someone who records music: The world of high-end audio is often tainted with bullshit. Precious (and often snake-oily) materials and terms are exploited to sell products for inflated prices. Faux science is deployed to trick you into thinking you need overpriced accessories like 2-inch-thick speaker cables.\nOnce you start shopping for gear that approaches four figures, it's tough to distinguish what's good-sounding from what's simply good-looking. Never fear! Our experts have spent thousands of hours listening to music in acoustically treated home studios through many of the most-loved high-end headphones, speakers, and amps on the market. Below you'll find our favorites and some information about what each item does.\nBefore reading on, be sure to check out our cheap (or free!) tips on how to get more out of your home audio setup.\nInterested in other audio advice? Check out the tips in our other guides, including the Best Wireless Headphones, Best Bookshelf Speakers, Best Turntables, Best Bluetooth Speakers, and Best Gear for Learning Music.\nUpdated January 2025: We've updated some other gear options and added the Outlaw Audio RR2160 Mk II.\nConsider where you will be listening before you decide what you should be listening with.\nThe quality of the sound you hear in your room will only ever be as good as the room itself. A pair of $250 speakers will sound better in a room that's been acoustically treated than a pair of $10,000 speakers will sound in an empty room with bare floors and walls.\nWhat exactly is \"bad\" when it comes to room dynamics for high-end listening? Typically it means sound waves bounce around too much, creating frequency issues like muddy bass and giving the room what's known as a long reverb decay time. This is the length of time it takes for sound to die out as it bounces off the walls.\nTry this: Clap your hands loudly in the middle of your room and listen for the decay—the audible echoing of that clapping sound. The best way to shorten that decay time is to fill the room with as much soft, porous mass as possible. This helps control audio reflections, damping them so you hear more of the focused sound waves coming out of the speakers, and fewer of the messy sound waves bouncing around the room. To treat a room, use acoustic panels (typically Rockwool insulation wrapped in cheap fabric and hung from the walls or ceiling) to provide the recommended amount of coverage for the space.\nThrobbing and thumping bass frequencies, which are harder to tame than higher frequencies like splashy cymbals and twangy guitars, will typically degrade the audio quality in smaller rooms. Significant porous absorption is required to make large speakers sound great in a tighter space like a bedroom. If you like big speakers with big bass, set up your system somewhere more spacious.\nIn general, the softer and bigger your room is the bigger you can go in terms of speaker systems, and the better they'll sound. If you're stuck setting up your stereo in a room that's either small or particularly reverberant and acoustically “bright,” I recommend buying smaller speakers or just sticking with headphones. (Don't worry, great headphones are awesome.)\nWhen improving your listening room, it's worth noting that investing in some acoustic treatment is much more cost-effective than investing in more expensive audio gear. You can buy or build enough panels for a medium-size space with just a few hundred dollars, and they can actually make your room look pretty neat. In my experience, hanging some panels and curtains over your bare walls will increase the quality of your sound more than any single piece of equipment.\nBecause they take problems with room acoustics out of the equation, a quality pair of headphones is the place most budding audiophiles should start.\nOpen-backed headphones like the Sennheiser/Drop HD6XX ($239) are a great first buy for those with a quiet listening room. “Open-back” means they don't seal out the outside world like the “closed-back” over-ears you might be used to. There's little to block sound in or out—not only will other people hear your music, but you'll be able to hear sounds other than your music. However, open-back headphones sound more natural and speaker-like. They are the perfect headphones to plug straight into a phone or a stereo, though you will notice that using a dedicated headphone amp improves the sound. (More on those later.)\nIf you want more sound isolation, I also really like in-ear headphones like the Shure Aonic 3 ($199), which cut out very nearly all outside noise, and pack up super small for travel. Sound quality is excellent, especially with an outboard headphone amp in tow.\nAt the higher end, my current favorite in-ears are from Portland-based brand Campfire Audio (the 3D-printed Supermoon ($1,099). I also love custom-molded in-ears from Ultimate Ears Pro like the brilliantly transparent UE Reference Remastered and the beefier UE 18+ Pro, both of which are among the most comfortable and accurate earbuds you'll find. There are many other high-end in-ears to choose from, with new models and technologies like xMEMS' solid-state drivers poised to increasingly shake up the market.\nIf you prefer over-ear headphones, our entire audio team really likes the French brand Focal. The Celestee closed-back headphones ($999) are as gorgeous to listen to as they are to look at, and the Bathys ($699) are wireless and offer noise-canceling, making them some of the best for travel. They produce one of the widest soundstages you'll find in wireless headphones. (In headphone lingo, the soundstage is the imaginary three-dimensional space you find yourself in when you shut your eyes and listen.) Other great wireless options that compete with wired headphones are the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 ($699) and the Master & Dynamic MW75 ($599), both of which feature beautiful design and high-end materials.\nI still have yet to encounter a pair of wireless earbuds that sound amazing, but the best I've tested are the Astell & Kern UW100 ($299), which have some of the most realistic sound you'll find, thanks to the company's excellent processing.\nFans of open-back listening with big budgets should check out the Elex ($599), a collaboration between Drop and Focal that brings elements of Focal's more expensive Elear and Clear headphones to the sub-$1,000 mark. They sound better than many pricier closed-back models. Another solid pair are the Neumann NDH 30 ($649), which are aimed at more studio-style sound. If you've got unlimited cash, the Audeze LCD-5 ($4,500) are exceptional. They offer the cleanest, clearest sound I've ever heard from a pair of headphones—great for high rollers without perfect listening rooms.\nA quality pair of wired speakers will last a lifetime with a little TLC, while powered/active speakers may have less longevity, but should still last many years. Speaker size and power output is an important factor when determining what to buy. For most people, smaller, “bookshelf-style\" speakers are the best fit. If you have a big listening space, though, consider going bigger. It's not always true, but larger speakers typically have better bass response and a wider, more expansive soundstage.\nYour first speaker purchase should be a quality pair for your desktop. After all, it's where you probably spend a lot of your time at home. For listening at my desk, I love the iLoud Micro Monitors ($350). They're a small pair that sound exceptional for their size and have surprisingly awesome bass response.\nIf you're looking for the best bookshelf speakers, my favorite pair is the KEF LS50 Wireless II ($2,500 per pair). They have the biggest, most detailed sound I've ever heard from a pair of speakers their size. The cheaper KEF LSX II ($1,300-1,400 per pair) are also great, as are the wired KEF LS50 Meta ($1,600 per pair). We've also recently tried and enjoyed the Q Acoustics M20 HD ($499 per pair), which are a solid option for those who want a small but great-sounding pair for a turntable or desktop with Bluetooth streaming.\nThe models I just mentioned are powered. They have amplification and connections built in, and they draw their power from a wall socket, so they can be used without a dedicated amplifier. If you already have an amp (or if you plan to buy one), a pair of passive speakers is the best way to go. Those hook up with regular speaker cables, and you won't need to worry about plugging them into the wall.\nSome passive bookshelf models I love are the ELAC Debut 2.0 ($380 per pair) and JBL 4309 ($1,100-2,000 per pair), though the latter is getting harder to find. The ELACs are a great entry-level speaker that will easily take you into audiophile territory with the right amp, whereas the 4309 more or less sound amazing with anything powering them. I'm a fan of fun, energetic sound when I'm listening on speakers, and both of these models deliver that, but with enough detail that you won't feel you're sacrificing anything.\nMore recently, we've tested some excellent options at relatively accessible pricing, like Focal's smooth and detailed Theva No 1 ($1,000 per pair) and the more taut and punchy SVS Ultra Evolution ($1,200 per pair), both of which are among our favorite reference speakers right now. If you like a brighter sound that really brings the bass, the Bowers & Wilkins 606 S3 ($1,100) are also worth considering.\nMoving away from bookshelves and onto passive floorstanding speakers, I'll highlight two very different models. The Paradigm Monitor SE 6000F ($1,000 per pair) are a great pair of speakers for those who like things a bit more clinical and precise—they're amazing for classical music, jazz, and folk, thanks to their incredible detail. Some audiophiles prefer the type of tight precision you get from speakers like the Paradigms. The more lively Klipsch Forte IV ($4,998 per pair) are perfectly tuned, mid-century–inspired masterpieces with hand-made wooden cabinets and gorgeous horn tweeters. Their 15-inch passive bass radiators at the back help them punch deeper and with more authority than a professional boxer. If you're looking for the most fun you've ever had listening to Hendrix at high volume, these are the way to go.\nYour taste may differ from mine! The best way to find your favorite high-end speakers is to use your ears. Find a local dealer and go listen to several models before you buy. For reference, other brands that make excellent speakers these days include Yamaha, Bang & Olufsen, and Polk Audio, among many other boutique brands.\nYou'll never know how a pair of speakers truly sounds in your room until you get them there, so try to test them at home. Most high-end dealers allow a trial option, but big-box retailers may not so check the return policy on anything you buy.\nDigital-to-analog converters (DACs) take the digital audio signal from your audio files and convert them to analog audio that you can send (via an amplifier) to headphones and speakers. Every piece of digital technology you own that comes with a headphone jack already has a DAC chip inside it, but it's usually a pretty cheap one. If you route your signal through a dedicated DAC—one with better components and a higher build quality than whatever's in your phone or computer you'll get higher fidelity from your digital files.\nIn my experience, if you have good headphones or speakers, it's worth investing in a proper outboard DAC. On the more affordable side, I love the options from AudioQuest ($120), Schiit ($259), and S.M.S.L. ($400). All of these connect to your computer or phone over USB or a digital audio cable. If you are willing to spend even more, the best DAC I've heard is the Chord Electronics Mojo 2 ($775). You can spend more, but higher-priced models typically also come with a headphone amplifier or other amplification on board.\nMany higher-end headphones sound their best when driven by a more powerful amplifier than what's built into your laptop, phone, or tablet. Headphone amplifiers take the signal from your DAC and amplify it with better overall fidelity than the cheapo amps found in most personal electronics. A good headphone amp can really bring more life and a more realistic soundstage to your music, mostly by providing better signal-to-noise ratio.\nAs with headphone amps, some of the best affordable options are from Schiit ($179) and S.M.S.L. ($199). You can spend a ton of money at the high end, but you probably don't need to go higher-end than the Rupert Neve Designs RNHP ($599). Neve was a legendary engineer who designed some of the most famous recording equipment in history, and he didn't cut any corners making his headphone amp either. It sounds warm and open, bringing even the densest mixes to life.\nQuality amps range from fully-fledged streaming models with color displays to old-school tube behemoths. Each has its place. Your main concern when shopping for a stereo amp should be how much power per channel you want and what kinds of analog and digital inputs you need.\nI'm a pretty lazy listener, which is why I love modern streaming amps. These amps have controls for Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and other streaming services built directly into easy-to-use interfaces. Streaming amps have gotten really great over the past few years. It used to be that anything with an internet connection sounded terrible, but that's not the case with the latest models. My high-end favorites right now are the Cambridge Audio Evo 150 ($2,999) and the Naim Uniti Atom ($3,799), which both feature gorgeous color displays and some of the best fidelity (and most glorious knobs) I've ever experienced. Both work with every major streaming service imaginable, and you can connect to them over Bluetooth.\nA good step-down option is Yamaha's R-N1000A ($1,800) stereo network receiver. It's loaded with high-end components like a SABRE ES9090Q DAC for high-resolution digital audio and enough A/B amplification for nearly any pair of speakers in your arsenal. Just as important, it provides rock-steady performance and loads of connection options, from tons of streaming services and internet radio stations to a turntable input and HDMI ARC for connecting to your TV. Its retro design, which skips a color screen for a slim digital display set below tactile knobs, stokes nostalgia while delivering excellent sound quality.\nFor something further stripped down that keeps the sound, Outlaw Audio's RR2160 Mk II ($999) is an intriguing option. The Mk II builds on the rushing clarity and punch for which the original was beloved with updates like hi-res Wi-Fi streaming and Ethernet. This isn’t the pick if you want all the modern trappings—there’s no HDMI ARC port for simplified TV connection, and even streaming stalwarts like Bluetooth and AirPlay are omitted. Instead, this economical power plant rewards your investment with fabulous fidelity and plenty of ways to connect, including a solid phono input for both Moving Magnet and Moving Coil cartridges. You will know it once you hear it, making this a great foundation for a streamlined system that puts the sound front and center.\nIf you don't have that kind of money, I highly recommend checking out the Canadian brand NAD. Its amps, like the NAD C 316 V2 ($399) aren't the flashiest, but they sound amazing for the money. Like the options above, the C 316 even comes with a phono channel on board so you can hook up a record player—a nice touch, seeing how NAD's model doesn't have built-in streaming. If you want to stream, you can find the proper dongle to connect your phone to it.\nVinyl is back! And turntables are more fun—and better-sounding—than ever. If you're looking for a starter deck with audiophile-grade sound quality, I would check out options like the Pro-Ject T1 ($399) or Debut Carbon Evo ($599). On the higher end, we like the Rega Planar 2 ($775), which has a bit more open and dynamic sound, and U-Turn's Orbit Theory ($999), which sounds fantastic thanks to extras like a custom-made magnesium tonearm, the part that sets the needle to the groove.\nIf you have a vintage stereo, it likely has a phono preamp built in, meaning you can plug a turntable directly and get straight to listening. But if you have a modern stereo, you may need to buy a dedicated phono preamp to play your records through your headphones or speakers. Check both your turntable and your stereo, because setups differ, and some turntables come with phono amps inside them that you can activate by flipping a switch. Still, while some built-in options like the one inside the Orbit Theory above perform well, others may not sound as good as you'd like.\nOutboard models like the Pro-Ject Phono Box DC ($129) and Fluance PA10 ($100) will raise the sound of many built-in models, but for truly high fidelity, I recommend more expensive models. My current favorite for the money is the Cambridge Audio Alva Solo ($229), but other acclaimed options include the Rega Fono MM ($445) and Pro-Ject Phono Box S2 Ultra ($349).\nPeople might tell you to spend more money than this on a phono stage, but I generally think those people are foolish. The signal profile for phono stages is set by the RIAA, the recording industry's big trade group. In theory, every good phono amp should sound nearly identical.\nAccessories are where the vast majority of audio snake oil shows up. The worst offender? Cables. The first thing to know is that unless you're running speaker cables for hundreds of feet, you just don't need to worry too much about cable quality. People will try to sell you crazy-expensive cables. Laugh at them and buy standard cabling—which isn't as cheap as it used to be due to the material costs of copper alone, but it’s still pretty affordable.\nYou're essentially paying up for looks and durability, not fidelity; cheaper speaker cables are more susceptible to fraying or breaking, but they carry audio signals just as well. Just buy modern wire and you'll be fine. Anyone who tells you otherwise doesn't understand physics.\nI also recommend grabbing some banana plugs, which you can easily twist speaker wire ends into to make quick plug-and-play connections between your amp and speakers.\nIn terms of sources, I'm a die-hard vinyl and Spotify listener, so I typically enjoy music in those two ways. I know Spotify's streams are compressed, but even through high-end gear, I can't hear any degradation on most tracks. (You probably can't, either.)\nI will say that a good portable player like the Astell & Kern SP3000 ($3,999) is a great option if you're on the go, though in most cases, your phone will provide excellent digital audio quality via its USB port.\nThere are also excellent new plug-and-go DACs made just for mobile phones. I've never used one, but the Chord Mojo 2 ($403) is beloved by many. I also like the THX Onyx ($200), which comes with a standard USB adapter in addition to USB-C, so you can also use it with iPhones and laptops.",

    "content_text": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nPizza night? Don’t open Uber Eats or DoorDash. The 44-year-old California chain called Pizza My Heart now lets you text a number and chat with an artificial intelligence chatbot to place your order. The chatbot’s name is Jimmy the Surfer, a nod to a recurring character from the company's old TV commercials.\nI texted “Jimmy” and asked if I could get a pineapple and anchovy pizza, then followed up asking if that was a good combo. “Pineapples and anchovies can make for a bold combination! It's all about that mix of sweet and salty flavors. Some folks dig it, while others have different tastes.” A political answer. After some suggestions, I asked Jimmy for a picture of one of his recommendations and he sent over a beaut. Finally, I picked a pie and asked for delivery—it wasn't clear how I was supposed to pay, so I asked and Jimmy clarified I could pay the delivery driver with cash or a credit card upon arrival.\nThis chatbot experience lives alongside several other ways to order from the pizza chain, including delivery apps, the company's website, and even traditional phone calls with a real human. (Pizza seems ripe for automation; Domino's has previously experimented with Alexa integration and text-to-order systems.)\nBut Palona AI—the company whose technology powers Jimmy—believes its solution can alleviate work for people in the store, make the ordering experience richer for the customer, and help brands form a deeper bond with their clientele.\nThe team behind Palona AI, which emerged from stealth mode last week after announcing $10 million in seed funding, has an impressive pedigree. CEO and cofounder Maria Zhang previously was a vice president of engineering at Google, general manager of the AI for Products group at Meta, and the chief technology officer at Tinder. Steve Liu, Palona's chief scientist, had a similar role at Samsung and is a professor at McGill University. CTO Tim Howes is the co-inventor of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and was the CTO at both Netscape and HP.\nZhang says Palona AI is already in use with a small business called MindZero, a contrast therapy spa in South Carolina, and will soon be deployed on the website of Wyze, the company known for its affordable security cameras. I tried the experience with MindZero's chatbot, which is accessible if you directly message the brand on Instagram. That's the thing about Palona—it can take various forms depending on the brand's needs. For Wyze, it will appear as a little chat window on the company's homepage. For Pizza My Heart, there's a dedicated number you can text or call. For MindZero, it's injected into the company's DMs.\nI asked MindZero's chatbot what the therapy does and how much sessions cost and had a back-and-forth not unlike what I had with Jimmy. Zhang says people are asking more questions than they did to a human person over the phone, and they're asking questions they didn't ask before. That includes “Can I be naked in the sauna,” which Zhang posits is a question someone might have felt a little awkward to ask a real human but had no such qualm asking over an Instagram DM. (It's worth noting that it wasn't clear I was chatting with an AI chatbot until I asked MindZero if it was a bot. Jimmy also did not indicate that it was an AI bot.)\nZhang says Palona AI is trying to help brands strengthen their identity and name recognition. A company like Wyze may be perceived as just a white-labeling outfit for Amazon, one of many faceless providers of smart home hardware. Also, Wyze's reliance on the mega-retailer means it has less access to customers and customer data. Deploying Palona's chatbot—whether through Wyze's website or social channels—can craft an identity consumers interact with and potentially help those shoppers form a stronger connection with the brand.\nPalona is trained on the brand's existing catalog and knowledge base and is designed to then be a personalized sales agent. The tech is powered by several large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, but Howe says the company has a separate patent-pending model that acts as a supervisor for all conversations. So if the chat deviates from all things Wyze, the supervisor model knows how to bring it back around to stay on topic. Zhang says Palona is built with an \"emotional intelligence\" language model designed to be effective in sales; the bot is familiar with things like humor, modern messaging etiquette, and “gentle persuasion.”\nWyze's chatbot is personified as a wizard, so its responses are on theme. When I asked it what the best security camera was, it said, “Let me guide you through some enchanting options.” The results were all obviously Wyze products, but that doesn't mean you can't ask about competitors. When I asked if the Nest Cam is better, the Wyze Wizard offered up pros for Wyze's Cam V4 and a few for the Nest Cam but ultimately said the Nest has a heftier price. “Ultimately, if you're seeking magical protection without breaking the bank, Wyze Cam V4 stands out as a beloved choice by many.”\nIt also uses that opportunity to upsell Wyze's subscription plan. Almost every time I asked a product-related question to Wyze's Wizard, it ended with a recommendation to snag Wyze's Cam Plus Plan. (Just like a real salesperson!) There's a memory capability in Palona too. It can build a customer profile so the chatbot can remember your preferences the next time, though it may be more useful for Jimmy the Surfer to remember that you like pineapple pizza than for Wyze's Wizard to know your security camera concerns.\n“We believe that this is going to be the preferred interactive model for consumers,\" Zhang says, citing that younger people are faster to embrace conversational interfaces. Think about asking ChatGPT a question versus a traditional Google Search. Now you can ask a brand directly anything about its catalog instead of trying to find it through a normal Amazon search, or at least that's what Palona envisions.\nPalona AI isn't the first or only company to employ AI as a salesperson—Big Sur AI is another that promises a similar chat-style experience that lets you ask questions about products but is also trained to help companies boost sales. Unlike human salespeople, these AI bots don't get a commission. That just might make them all the more enticing for businesses to use.",

    "content_text": "This week, some auto industry observers felt a creeping sense of déjà vu. Seemingly out of nowhere, a Chinese firm made international headlines by besting Western companies at the tech they supposedly invented.\nNo, it wasn’t BYD, the 20-year-old automaker that gained sudden global recognition in recent years as it began to export low-price electric vehicles all over the world. (BYD built more electric vehicles in 2024 than Tesla.) This week’s buzz was about DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that shocked techies when it released a new open-source artificial intelligence model with seemingly a fraction of the funding US competitors have hoovered up to build their own. DeepSeek’s success saw US tech stocks slide earlier this week, and investors scramble to reexamine their bets.\nIn some ways, experts say, the startup’s success follows the auto industry’s playbook. And the lesson was similar: Chinese firms can still build it better and more cheaply. “There is an underestimation of Chinese innovation and ingenuity,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow researching Chinese policy at the nonprofit Center for Strategic and International Studies. “There is resourcefulness even when there may not be access to the best technology.”\nMany of China’s major global economic success stories have emerged out of a similar national strategy, says Susan Helper, an economist with Case Western Reserve University who studies global supply chains and manufacturing and worked on EV policy in the Biden administration. Cars, solar panels, batteries, steel: “It’s basically, decide on an industry that's critical, and put a lot of money towards it for a long time,” she says. (Compare that with the US approach to cars, “where we change our minds on electric vehicles every few years.”)\nIn the case of cars, the Chinese government has for nearly two decades subsidized electric-vehicle-makers, given tax breaks to electric vehicle customers, and created policies that require the entire country to reduce emissions and go electric—a push in the EV direction. Chinese AI investment is much more recent, but growing bigger. In the past decade, the Chinese government has poured over $200 billion into AI-related firms, Stanford researchers estimate. Just this month, it announced a new $8.2 billion AI investment fund.\nAdditionally, Helper says, Chinese industry benefits from blurrier boundaries between the government, private firms, and the military.\nThe result is an AI ecosystem that’s certainly not identical to the auto one, but has a few echoes. The history of the Chinese auto industry demonstrates sophisticated research networks and firms’ abilities to build on the success of their predecessors, says Kyle Chan, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University who writes about Chinese industrial and climate policy. Witness the success of Geely, which began the late 1980s as a refrigerator parts company before transitioning to autos in 1997. For its first four years, it didn’t actually have a license to operate in China; today, it produces 3.3 million vehicles and sells internationally, in addition to owning major stakes in Volvo, Polestar, and Aston Martin. Geely and other automakers that emerged in the same time frame—Chery, BYD, Great Wall Motor—have now produced a new wave of manufacturers. Today, about 100 domestic brands are selling in China.\nSimilarly, research papers involving DeepSeek employees show the startup’s workers are also embedded in the same networks as the larger and more established Chinese tech giants that came before, including ByteDance and Baidu. The startup seems to have recruited young people from the same well-regarded, state-run universities, including Tsinghua University and Zhejiang University.\nChinese automakers “built on the foundation that was there before,” says Chan. Now, “DeepSeek is one of many startups that have emerged that benefited from an earlier generation of tech foundation builders.” Because of that deepening bench of technology talent, Chan says, there is no guarantee that just because DeepSeek seems to be winning Chinese AI right now means it’ll be winning next year, or even next month.\nThe major difference between the growth of homegrown Chinese auto and AI industries, of course, is speed. Automotive supply chains are global and complex, and building them required marshaling not only new software, but also battery minerals, battery mineral processing capabilities, parts suppliers, and factories. So maybe it is no surprise: It took Chinese firms many years to develop a domestic technology that could give other nations a run for their money. “This was a slow-moving train,” says Mazzocco.\nChinese large language models, by contrast, have emerged very quickly. “Everything is just compressed now. It’s happening much faster,” says Chan. The biggest lesson seems to be that, globally, everyone should start paying attention.",

And the lesson was similar: Chinese firms can still build it better and more cheaply. “There is an underestimation of Chinese innovation and ingenuity,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow researching Chinese policy at the nonprofit <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.csis.org/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.csis.org/\" href=\"https://www.csis.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a>. “There is resourcefulness even when there may not be access to the best technology.”</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Many of China’s major global economic success stories have emerged out of a similar national strategy, says Susan Helper, an economist with Case Western Reserve University who studies global supply chains and manufacturing and worked on EV policy in the Biden administration. Cars, solar panels, batteries, steel: “It’s basically, decide on an industry that's critical, and put a lot of money towards it for a long time,” she says. (Compare that with the US approach to cars, “where we change our minds on electric vehicles every few years.”)</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">In the case of cars, the Chinese government has for nearly two decades subsidized electric-vehicle-makers, given tax breaks to electric vehicle customers, and created policies that require the entire country to reduce emissions and go electric—a push in the EV direction. Chinese AI investment is much more recent, but growing bigger. In the past decade, the Chinese government <a href=\"https://sccei.fsi.stanford.edu/china-briefs/government-venture-capital-and-ai-development-china\">has poured over $200 billion</a> into AI-related firms, Stanford researchers estimate. Just this month, it announced a new $8.2 billion AI investment fund.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Additionally, Helper says, Chinese industry benefits from blurrier boundaries between the government, private firms, and the military.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The result is an AI ecosystem that’s certainly not identical to the auto one, but has a few echoes. The history of the Chinese auto industry demonstrates sophisticated research networks and firms’ abilities to build on the success of their predecessors, says Kyle Chan, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University who <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.high-capacity.com/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.high-capacity.com/\" href=\"https://www.high-capacity.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">writes about</a> Chinese industrial and climate policy. Witness the success of Geely, which began the late 1980s as a refrigerator parts company before transitioning to autos in 1997. For its first four years, it didn’t actually have a license to operate in China; today, it produces 3.3 million vehicles and sells internationally, in addition to owning major stakes in Volvo, Polestar, and Aston Martin. Geely and other automakers that emerged in the same time frame—Chery, BYD, Great Wall Motor—have now produced a new wave of manufacturers. Today, about 100 domestic brands are selling in China.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Two years ago, developer Valentin Squirelo went on a mission. With Twitch fans at his side, he and his viewers began work on a face-recognition program that allows disabled individuals to control game inputs through their expressions. For Squirelo and his community, the program—dubbed PlayAbility—was the answer to the limitations of accessible hardware.\n“We are huge believers of connecting everything together,” Squirelo says. “We have created PlayAbility not to replace everything but to connect with everything. So that's why we choose to focus on face gestures, being able to move analog triggers, analog sticks, stuff that you can't really do with other software.”\nHaving software that can enable a player to use facial movements rather than a game controller is huge. Despite being designed for disabled gamers, Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller and PlayStation's Access Controller don’t work for everyone. They're also cost-prohibitive for some players.\nOther adaptive third-party controllers exist but aren't compatible with all systems. Combine that with the fact that each piece of accessible hardware primarily addresses only a certain set of needs and you’re left with a scenario where there’s no universal device that can serve the more than 450 million disabled players who exist worldwide. And it's all but impossible to create one.\n“When you’re looking at accessible hardware, the number one thing that you need to do is look at your client first,” says Erik Johnson, an occupational therapist and the chief medical officer of Warfighter Engaged, a nonprofit that makes modified game controllers for veterans. “Time and time again, what I will find is that people will try and match the hardware with the client rather than the client with the hardware. In the community of people with disabilities, there’s always going to be something they can’t do.”\nPlayAbility, Squirelo hopes, can bridge the gap between accessible hardware and disabled individuals who need it.\nSquirelo’s passion for accessibility is twofold. He grew up around friends and family members living with disabilities and also had ADHD. Beyond that, he has a strong desire to help people. The release of PlayAbility, which began rolling out late last year, is the culmination of years of collaborative efforts with his Twitch community to create a program that pushes the boundaries and understandings of accessible software.\n“I always had a community on Twitch of people with disabilities and we were already trying to find stuff,” he says. Those players have been helping Squirelo from the start, offering advice, testing new features, and ultimately giving people tools to help them play.\nSquirelo’s creation attempts to target the individualistic nature of the disabled experience. While adaptive hardware like the Xbox Adaptive Controller and PlayStation’s Access Controller offer customization through different buttons, switches, sticks, and button placement, disabled players are still limited to aspects like desk space, individual strength and energy levels, and even their finances. A basic PlayAbility account is free, and lets players control pretty much any game available on PC through whatever facial motions they have.\nFor Eduard Poch, Squirelo’s vision is clearly working. As a kid, Poch's strength and dexterity allowed him to use standard controllers. Yet, as he grew older and his disability progressed, restricting his hand movements, he needed to rely on adaptive equipment. While accessible hardware was beneficial, his individualistic experience prevented him from fully using devices on the market.\n“That's why I bought a computer, because it was easier for me to use the keyboard and mouse,” Poch says. “Even so, I have trouble reaching certain buttons, since I can only have one hand on the left part of the keyboard. Thanks to PlayAbility, I can use a larger number of buttons immediately with a simple movement of the face.”\nPoch’s experience of buying numerous devices to find the right solution speaks to an issue every disabled person encounters in gaming: the cost of playing. For those who rely on fixed incomes, they can expect to spend upwards of $300 for a complete Xbox Adaptive Controller setup, and approximately $250 for a complete set of Access Controllers. Combine that with the need to purchase additional switches, buttons, and sticks from third-party vendors, and adaptive equipment can cost the same as a console.\nPlayAbility costs significantly less. Even the unlimited premium plan is just a one-time payment of €129 ($132). The only equipment needed is a standard web cam. And while the cost of PlayAbility is an expense that disabled players must account for, it pales in comparison to finding an adaptive hardware setup that may not even work as an individual's disabilities progress.\nIn some of the program’s promotional materials, PlayAbility refers to the technology used as “cutting-edge AI,” but Squirelo admits the technology behind the software isn’t the high-powered stuff people think of when they hear “AI” these days. “We are using computer vision in a way, but we can call it AI,\" he says. Instead, PlayAbility functions using algorithms that translate facial movements into game actions. This was especially beneficial when it came to the cost of developing the program.\n“We don't need to buy expensive hardware,” he said. “For me, the most essential benefit of using AI is to bring technology without [that] expense. We don't need to adapt for the people. It's automatically adapted to people.”\nAs Poch praises PlayAbility’s function, not every user experience is the same. Marijin Rongen, the news editor of gaming site Can I Play That?, says PlayAbility’s face-recognition software struggles to accurately detect those with facial differences. (Full disclosure: This writer was previously an editor at Can I Play That?) Currently, the program greatly benefits motor-related disabilities but cannot account for all forms of physical disabilities. And even though Rongen acknowledges its importance, its flaws demonstrate the multifaceted nature of disabilities.\n“My face is asymmetrical, with features on my right side being somewhat less developed (smaller) than on my left,” Rongen says. “Due to this, the software detects certain gestures by default even while my expression is neutral. Performing facial gestures, like moving my mouth a certain way, causes several other gestures to trigger as well. This does limit the number of different gestures I can map to actions and perform with comfort and accuracy.”\nPoch and Rongen's experiences with PlayAbility highlight the current dilemma of accessible equipment. There is no perfect solution, and players often need to rely on both hardware and software to play games.\nThe relationship between hardware and software is equally similar and distinct—both serve the disabled community, but both serve in different ways, with some individuals requiring one over the other.\nOf the two first-party devices currently on the market, the Xbox Adaptive Controller embraces full customization, but sacrifices the compact layout of a standard controller that can benefit those with limited reach. Meanwhile, PlayStation’s Access Controller's nine buttons are more akin to a traditional PS controller, but it doesn't offer every function of a DualSense, forcing disabled players to either purchase a second Access Controller or sacrifice actions in a game.\nRegardless of hardware or software, more choice is crucial to creating an accessible industry. Thanks to playAbility, disabled individuals can access games through software alone, or with a combination of both hardware and software. That’s what Squirelo wants. Whether it’s through casual play or therapeutic treatments, PlayAbility has the potential to revolutionize the way the gaming industry approaches accessibility.\n“In the last few months we started working with many people with cognitive disabilities, developmental disabilities,” Squirelo says. “We are working with kids with autism and it's so good for them to be able to have feedback and real-time interaction between moves. We see so much potential for this. But at this point, I think my goal is that we can all play together on a Sunday afternoon.”\nPlayAbility is not the ultimate solution but rather a bridge that creates a more inclusive and accessible environment between disabled individuals and the games they play. Will it successfully break down every barrier? No. And that's ultimately OK. Choice will do more for accessibility than a single device or piece of software. As Johnson notes, the goal of the gaming industry isn't to own the rights to accessibility—it's to let people play, and more importantly enjoy, games.\n“PlayStation wants it, Xbox wants it, individual game developers want it,\" Johnson says. “You'll see a lot of people saying ‘How did you do that?’ and nobody says ‘We're not going to tell you because it's a trade secret.’”",

    "content_text": "Dr. Phil filming a ride-along with ICE agents, interviewing apparent migrants, and making it look like an episode of Cops feels like something I’d dream up after taking a little too much melatonin and scrolling TikTok before bed.\nBut instead, the “contentification” of President Donald Trump’s policy is indeed the logical next step for a team that won the election with the help of influencers and content creators. Following suit, Trump’s cabinet has basically created the White House’s own cinematic universe.\nOnly a few days after her confirmation, Kristi Noem, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security secretary, was filmed alongside Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducting an operation. “I’m here in New York City,” Noem told the camera in a vertical video, wearing a bulletproof vest and with a fresh blowout. “We’re getting these dirtbags off these streets.”\nBack in December, I wrote that we should not only expect the government to continue its work with influencers but also to become influencers themselves. This week it became clear that this is what the Trump administration has been planning to do with its cabinet leaders all along. They’re not just leading the government, they’re making content while doing it.\nLook at who Trump nominated for cabinet positions. Nearly across the board, these nominees have experience playing it up for the camera. Noem is a MAGA media veteran, often appearing on networks like Newsmax to discuss topics of the day. Linda McMahon, wife to former WWE CEO Vince McMahon, has gotten in the wrestling ring a time or two herself. Over the course of his presidential campaign, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. couldn’t get enough of the media, appearing on Joe Rogan’s podcast and anywhere else that would have him. And of course, Pete Hegseth is a former Fox News host. On Tuesday, CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter wrote that these ICE raids were crafted with television and the internet in mind.\nBefore his first week in office, Trump had played casting director. Now, we’re getting the pilot episodes.\nStill, it’s not like all that much has changed in terms of digital infrastructure at these agencies. It might just be that the GOP is doing it better—and giving their audience what it wants. Even under the Biden administration, DHS and ICE organized ride-alongs with the media, especially with MAGA-friendly broadcasters like Fox News. The agencies would often post photos of enforcement officers cuffing alleged migrants on platforms like X as well. Most of the multimedia staffers are career employees with few slots for political appointees, according to a source familiar with DHS’s public affairs office.\nBut as Stelter wrote yesterday, the tone of the content is different. And that’s likely a result of the onscreen talent. You’re going to get an entirely different product when working with media veterans like Dr. Phil and Noem. The only Biden cabinet secretary that could rival those two was Pete Buttigieg.\nWhile all of this is happening, the Democrats are waiting to elect a new director before they can even think about casting. On Saturday, Democrats will be voting on their next party chair. There are nearly a dozen people running to fill the spot, but the election is mainly seen as a two-man race between Wisconsin party chair Ben Wikler and Ken Martin, a DNC vice chair.\nWikler, Martin, and many other candidates appeared on a virtual forum Tuesday night specifically focused on the DNC’s future in tech and media. For about an hour, they were asked how they would revamp the party’s data infrastructure and tackle new media. Many of them appeared anxious to take it on.\nWhen I first started covering this beat, Wikler was constantly pitched to me as an example of a Democratic party official who was doing digital the right way. I spoke with him in December, where he reinforced that Democrats needed to respond to the changing media environment quickly if they planned to win elections in the near future. On Tuesday night, Wikler went on to suggest that the DNC create its own innovation lab focused on keeping up with their opposition.\n“You need to build a culture of curiosity, innovation, experimentation, and iteration, knowing that many things won’t work,” Wikler said Tuesday night. “So you need to try even more things.”\nMartin wants to do something similar by building an “Information War Room” more focused on fighting misinformation.\n“That Information War Room will become the hub for better, ongoing, constant digital communications with real-time analytics and also with social listening, so we understand where the misinformation and disinformation is being pumped out, and as part of that, we need to recruit trusted messengers, influencers, creators, and their networks to communicate over the long haul,” Martin said.\nThat war room already exists on the right. The Trump campaign hosted influencers for special debate war rooms, and the same person who ran the Trump campaign’s war room has now been appointed “war room director” for the White House.\nFaiz Shakir, a former Bernie Sanders adviser and the executive director of More Perfect Union, is also running for DNC chair, and he sees things differently. Instead of simply partnering with creators, he envisions a DNC that acts as its own media network. “You don't just sprinkle fairy dust on a Mobilize link or YouTube link,” he said. “We should be raising money right now for the national Meals on Wheels Association, Head Start for America, just raise money for them and build engagement. Do actions on the ground with people, send videographers. This is what I'm doing right now at More Perfect Union.”\nOn Saturday, Democrats will choose who they want leading the party and taking on what will likely be a massive digital rebrand. During Tuesday’s forum, many of the candidates promised to move past the “boom-and-bust” periods of investing in digital and then stripping programs down to the bones between election cycles.\nBut it’s hard to imagine they’ll be able to keep up. Republicans have invested in this for years, and Trump has clearly brought it all to the White House. Plus, season two has just begun.\nThe Chatroom\nEarlier this week, Ryan Broderick, who writes the fantastic Garbage Day newsletter, posted about how difficult it’s been to keep up with all of the news coming out of the White House. I’ve made a career out of staring at news on the computer (amongst other things), and my feeds were full of an unending cycle too.\nSo I want to check in. Are you even trying to keep up with all of this? Gone full Luddite? Or maybe you’ve created the ultimate anti-brain-rot system and every piece of verifiable Trump news flows directly through your Neuralink chip and into your head.\nYou can leave a comment or send your thoughts to mail@wired.com.\nWIRED Reads\nElon Musk Lackeys Have Taken Over the Office of Personnel Management: Musk allies have flooded the OPM with new hires linked to xAI, Neuralink, the Boring Company, and Palantir.\nElon Musk Is Running the Twitter Playbook on the Federal Government: My colleague Zoë Schiffer, who wrote an entire book on Musk’s Twitter takeover, blogged about how the US federal government is following the same playbook the billionaire applied to the social media platform.\nFederal Spending Freeze Threatens Ecosystems and Public Safety: The White House’s funding freeze stops funding for disaster relief, clean drinking-water programs, and apparently the Green New Deal, which was never passed.\nWant more?

Marc Andreessen, tech investor and Trump ally, says the quiet part out loud. A previously dull subreddit for federal workers is now a major source of #hopecore.

    "content_text": "For reasons that were not immediately clear, SpaceX founder Elon Musk took to his social media site X on Tuesday evening to make a perplexing space-based pronouncement.\n“The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible. We will do so,” Musk wrote. “Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.”\nNow generally, at Ars Technica, it is not our policy to write stories strictly based on things Elon Musk says on X. However, this statement was so declarative, and so consternation-inducing for NASA, it bears a bit of explication.\nFirst of all, the most plausible explanation for this is that Elon is being Elon. “He’s trolling,” said one of my best space policy sources shortly after Musk’s tweet. After all, the tweet was sent at 4:20 pm in the central time zone, where SpaceX now has its headquarters.\nEven if it is trolling, it will still cause headaches within NASA.\nForemost, NASA has gone to great lengths to stress that the two astronauts referenced here—Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams—are not stranded on the International Space Station. There is some debate about whether there was a period last summer when the pair, who flew to the space station on a Boeing Starliner vehicle in early June, were briefly stranded. That mission was hobbled by technical issues, including problems with Starliner’s propulsion system. (Ultimately, Starliner flew home without its crew.) However, since the arrival of SpaceX’s Crew-9 mission with two empty seats in late September, Wilmore and Williams have had a safe ride home. The Dragon vehicle is presently docked to the space station.\nThen along comes Musk, with one of the world’s loudest microphones, shouting that NASA’s astronauts are stranded and that President Trump wants them saved. It’s a bombshell thing for the founder of SpaceX, who has become a close adviser to Trump, to say publicly.\nIt is also possible that Musk was not trolling and that Trump asked SpaceX to return Wilmore and Williams earlier for political reasons—namely to, in their view, shame the Biden administration.\nNeither NASA nor SpaceX responded immediately to a request for comment on Tuesday evening.\nCould They Come Back?\nIf Trump demanded that NASA bring the astronauts back now, the Crew-9 mission could return to Earth earlier. It is presently scheduled to splash down in the Pacific Ocean in early April. According to NASA, and the astronauts themselves, Wilmore and Williams are doing fine in space. They have plenty of food and clothes, and plenty of work to do. Privately, sources have told Ars the same. Although Wilmore and Williams were not initially expecting to spend 10 months in space, they're taking no serious risks in doing so. In fact, it’s part of their jobs to tackle these kinds of contingencies.\nThe current return date is being driven by the launch of the Crew-10 mission, also on a SpaceX vehicle. This mission is flying a new Dragon spacecraft, and SpaceX previously asked for a little more time to process and prepare the spacecraft for its debut launch. This moved the target for flying this mission from February to March 25. To meet this date, sources indicated that it’s possible SpaceX may need to appropriate a different, previously flown Dragon—possibly the Dragon intended for use by the Axiom-4 mission—to complete Crew-10.\nNASA would very much prefer the four astronauts on Crew-10 arrive before Crew-9 departs. Why? Because if Crew-9 were to depart sooner, it would leave just a single astronaut, Don Pettit, on board the station. Pettit is a very experienced and capable astronaut, but having just a single NASA astronaut on board to operate the US segment of the station is far from optimal. In addition to leaving Pettit in a difficult position, it would cancel a planned spacewalk in March and leave just a single person to prepare a Northrop Grumman cargo spacecraft for departure. This is apparently a big deal.\n“It takes time to load trash; everything has to be packed in certain bags in certain locations for various reasons,” a NASA source told Ars. “For example, any batteries that are being trashed have to be in a fireproof container. Bags have to be loaded in certain locations to maintain the proper center of gravity. And you’ve got seven crew members’ worth of trash that have already been waiting since the last disposal flight.”\nAnother consideration is if Crew-10 were to slip further from its late March launch date. Pettit flew to the space station on a Russian Soyuz vehicle, and it is due to return on April 20. The Soyuz spacecraft is certified to remain in orbit for 210 days, and April 20 is already 221 days after their launch. April 20 is probably a hard end date for that mission.\nSo technically, yes, the “stranded” astronauts on the space station probably could come home as early as next week. But if they were to do so, it would create a lot of headaches for NASA, its international partners, and probably even for Musk’s human spaceflight team at SpaceX.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

We will do so,” <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1884365928038563880\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1884365928038563880\" href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1884365928038563880\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Musk wrote</a>. “Terrible that the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/joe-biden/\">Biden</a> administration left them there so long.”</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">Now generally, at Ars Technica, it is not our policy to write stories strictly based on things Elon Musk says on X. However, this statement was so declarative, and so consternation-inducing for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/nasa/\">NASA</a>, it bears a bit of explication.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">First of all, the most plausible explanation for this is that Elon is being Elon. “He’s trolling,” said one of my best space policy sources shortly after Musk’s tweet. After all, the tweet was sent at 4:20 pm in the central time zone, where SpaceX now has its headquarters.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Even if it is trolling, it will still cause headaches within NASA.</p><p class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe iDXPAN callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Foremost, NASA has gone to great lengths to stress that the two astronauts referenced here—<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/boeing-starliner-astronauts-stranded-until-march-nasa/\">Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams</a>—are not stranded on the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/international-space-station/\">International Space Station</a>. There is some debate about whether there was a period last summer when the pair, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/boeing-starliner-launch-spacex-international-space-station/\">who flew to the space station on a Boeing Starliner vehicle in early June</a>, were briefly stranded. That mission was hobbled by <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/starliner-return-nasa-spacex-boeing-iss/\">technical issues</a>, including problems with Starliner’s propulsion system. (Ultimately, Starliner <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/09/the-future-of-boeings-crewed-spaceflight-program-is-muddy-after-starliners-return/#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=starliner%20landed%20boeing%20berger&amp;gsc.sort=\">flew home without its crew</a>.) However, since the arrival of SpaceX’s Crew-9 mission with two empty seats in late September, Wilmore and Williams have had a safe ride home. The Dragon vehicle is presently docked to the space station.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Then along comes Musk, with one of the world’s loudest microphones, shouting that NASA’s astronauts are stranded and that President Trump wants them saved. It’s a bombshell thing for the founder of SpaceX, who has become a close adviser to Trump, to say publicly.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It is also possible that Musk was not trolling and that Trump asked SpaceX to return Wilmore and Williams earlier for political reasons—namely to, in their view, shame the Biden administration.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Neither NASA nor SpaceX responded immediately to a request for comment on Tuesday evening.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Could They Come Back?</h2><p class=\"paywall\">If Trump demanded that NASA bring the astronauts back now, the Crew-9 mission could return to Earth earlier. It is presently scheduled to splash down in the Pacific Ocean in early April. According to NASA, and the astronauts themselves, Wilmore and Williams are doing fine in space. They have plenty of food and clothes, and plenty of work to do. Privately, sources have told Ars the same. Although Wilmore and Williams were not initially expecting to spend 10 months in space, they're taking no serious risks in doing so. In fact, it’s part of their jobs to tackle these kinds of contingencies.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The current return date is being driven by the launch of the Crew-10 mission, also on a SpaceX vehicle. This mission is flying a new Dragon spacecraft, and SpaceX previously asked for a little more time to process and prepare the spacecraft for its debut launch. This moved the target for flying this mission from February to March 25. To meet this date, sources indicated that it’s possible SpaceX may need to appropriate a different, previously flown Dragon—possibly the Dragon intended for use by the Axiom-4 mission—to complete Crew-10.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "The Chinese generative artificial intelligence platform DeepSeek has had a meteoric rise this week, stoking rivalries and generating market pressure for United States–based AI companies, which in turn has invited scrutiny of the service. Amid the hype, researchers from the cloud security firm Wiz published findings on Wednesday that show that DeepSeek left one of its critical databases exposed on the internet, leaking system logs, user prompt submissions, and even users’ API authentication tokens—totaling more than 1 million records—to anyone who came across the database.\nDeepSeek is a relatively new company and has been virtually unreachable to press and other organizations this week. In turn, the company did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment about the exposure. The Wiz researchers say that they themselves were unsure about how to disclose their findings to the company and simply sent information about the discovery on Wednesday to every DeepSeek email address and LinkedIn profile they could find or guess. The researchers have yet to receive a reply, but within a half hour of their mass contact attempt, the database they found was locked down and became inaccessible to unauthorized users. It is unclear whether any malicious actors or authorized parties accessed or downloaded any of the data.\n“The fact that mistakes happen is correct, but this is a dramatic mistake, because the effort level is very low and the access level that we got is very high,” Ami Luttwak, the CTO of Wiz tells WIRED. “I would say that it means that the service is not mature to be used with any sensitive data at all.”\nExposed databases that are accessible to anyone on the open internet are a long-standing problem that institutions and cloud providers have slowly worked to address. But the Wiz researchers note that the DeepSeek database they found was visible almost immediately with minimal scanning or probing.\n“Usually when we find this kind of exposure, it’s in some neglected service that takes us hours to find—hours of scanning,” says Nir Ohfeld, the head of vulnerability research at Wiz. But this time, “here it was at the front door.” Ohfeld adds that the “technical difficulty of this vulnerability is the bare minimum.”\nThe researchers say that the trove they found appears to have been a type of open source database typically used for server analytics called a ClickHouse database. And the exposed information supported this, given that there were log files that contained the routes or paths users had taken through DeepSeek’s systems, the users’ prompts and other interactions with the service, and the API keys they had used to authenticate. The prompts the researchers saw were all in Chinese, but they note that it is possible the database also contained prompts in other languages. The researchers say they did the absolute minimum assessment needed to confirm their findings without unnecessarily compromising user privacy, but they speculate that it may even have been possible for a malicious actor to use such deep access to the database to move laterally into other DeepSeek systems and execute code in other parts of the company’s infrastructure.\n“It's pretty shocking to build an AI model and leave the backdoor wide open from a security perspective,” says independent security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who was not involved in the Wiz research but specializes in discovering exposed databases. “This type of operational data and the ability for anyone with an internet connection to access it and then manipulate it is a major risk to the organization and users.”\nDeepSeek’s systems are seemingly designed to be very similar to OpenAI’s, the researchers told WIRED on Wednesday, perhaps to make it easier for new customers to transition to using DeepSeek without difficulty. The entire DeepSeek infrastructure appears to mimic OpenAI’s, they say, down to details like the format of the API keys.\nThe Wiz researchers say they don’t know if anyone else found the exposed database before they did, but it wouldn’t be surprising, given how simple it was to discover. Fowler, the independent researcher, also notes that the vulnerable database would have “definitely” been found quickly—if it wasn’t already—whether by other researchers or bad actors.\n“I think this is a wake-up call for the wave of AI products and services we will see in the near future and how seriously they take cybersecurity,” he says.\nDeepSeek has made a global impact over the past week, with millions of people flocking to the service and pushing it to the top of Apple’s and Google’s app stores. The resulting shock waves have wiped billions from the stock prices of US-based AI companies and spooked executives at firms across the country. On Wednesday, sources at OpenAI told the Financial Times that it was looking into DeepSeek’s alleged use of ChatGPT outputs to train its models.\nAt the same time, DeepSeek has increasingly drawn the attention of lawmakers and regulators around the world, who have started to ask questions about the company’s privacy policies, the impact of its censorship, and whether its Chinese ownership provides national security concerns.\nItaly’s data protection regulator sent DeepSeek a series of questions asking about where it obtained its training data, if people’s personal information was included in this, and the firm’s legal grounding for using this information. As WIRED Italy reported, the DeepSeek app appeared to be unavailable to download within the country following the questions being sent.\nDeepSeek’s Chinese connections also appear to be raising security concerns. At the end of last week, according to CNBC reporting, the US Navy issued an alert to its personnel warning them not to use DeepSeek’s services “in any capacity.” The email said Navy members of staff should not download, install, or use the model, and raised concerns of “potential security and ethical” issues.\nHowever, despite the hype, the exposed data shows that almost all technologies relying on cloud-hosted databases can be vulnerable through simple security lapses. “AI is the new frontier in everything related to technology and cybersecurity,” Wiz’s Ohfeld says, “and still we see the same old vulnerabilities like databases left open on the internet.”",

DOGE is based out of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, just steps from the White House.\nAt an exclusive black-tie dinner hosted by the Alfalfa Club last week, Musk told associates that he’d even been invited to spend the night in the White House itself in the Lincoln Bedroom.\nThe news shows how deeply Musk has embedded himself in President Donald Trump’s orbit—and how closely he’s following his tried-and-true playbook from Tesla and Twitter (now X).\nDuring busy periods at Tesla, Musk was known for sleeping on the factory floor. “It was my primary residence,” he claimed during an interview with Ron Baron in 2022. He said the move was strategic, as he wanted employees to see him. “This is important because if the team thinks their leader is off somewhere having a good time, drinking Mai Tais on a tropical island, which I definitely could have been doing … since the team could see me sleeping on the floor during shift change, they knew I was there, and that made a huge difference, they gave it their all.”\nThe vision of a leader drinking cocktails on a tropical island resurfaced after Musk became Twitter’s biggest shareholder in the spring of 2022. In text messages to his friend, the podcaster and angel investor Jason Calacanis, Musk said Twitter’s newly appointed CEO Parag Agrawal was on a 10-day vacation in Hawaii. At the time, Musk had been toying with the idea of joining Twitter’s board of directors, but was growing increasingly frustrated with Agrawal. He doubted the two could work together.\n“Btw, Parag is still on a ten day vacation in Hawaii,” Musk told Calacanis. “No reason to cut it short … in your first tour as ceo (!!!),” Calcanis responded, presumably with a hint of sarcasm. “Shouldn’t he be in a war room right now?!?” Musk then said: “Does doing occasional zoom calls while drinking fruity cocktails at the Four Seasons count?” (The messages were later revealed as part of the discovery process in a lawsuit between Musk and Twitter).\nUltimately, Musk decided he could not save Twitter with Agrawal at the helm, and he bought the company instead.\nAfter the acquisition was complete, Musk began sleeping at the Twitter offices in San Francisco. Employees saw him pacing the floor late at night and being escorted to the bathroom by his security guards. He even tried to get a bathroom installed next to his office so he wouldn’t have to trek across the floor during his stays.\nMusk’s lieutenant Steve Davis, CEO of the Boring Company, who has reportedly been recruiting staff to work at DOGE, also temporarily moved into Twitter HQ with his wife and newborn baby.\nEarlier this week, the US Office of Personnel Management, which is already stacked with Musk lackeys, sent an email to federal workers titled “a fork in the road.”\n“The federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work,” the email read. It directed employees to return to the office five days a week, and commit to a culture of excellence, or effectively resign and continue receiving benefits and pay through September.\nThe memo closely echoed a note Musk sent to Twitter staff shortly after buying the company. In that note, sent November 16, 2022, Musk told staffers they’d need to commit to working long, intense hours to realize his new vision for the company—otherwise they should resign. “Going forward, to build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be extremely hardcore,” he wrote. “This will mean working long hours at high intensity.

    "content_text": "This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nA sudden pause in federal assistance is sowing disarray and outrage across the country, throwing into doubt a wide range of programs that help protect Americans from disasters, provide access to clean drinking water and affordable energy and help protect ecosystems, among many other issues.\nThe order, which came in a memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget on Monday, directed agencies across the government to suspend federal assistance that might not be aligned with the policies of President Donald Trump, “including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, [diversity, equity and inclusion], woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.” The Green New Deal, never enacted into law, was a proposal for climate and economic spending.\nThe memo, copies of which were posted by news organizations, directed agencies to review all their assistance programs “and supporting activities consistent with the President’s policies and requirements,” pointing to executive orders Trump has issued covering immigration, foreign aid, energy, climate change and other issues. It ordered agencies to provide detailed information on these programs by February 10 and to “cancel awards already awarded that are in conflict with Administration priorities.”\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the order right before it was set to take effect after groups including the American Public Health Association sued, according to The New York Times. In a separate action Tuesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, said on social media that she and a coalition of states were also suing to block the White House order.\nWhile the memorandum said assistance given directly to individuals, including Medicare and Social Security benefits, is excluded, it gave little guidance for what it would apply to.\nAn accompanying list of instructions shared with Inside Climate News, however, lists more than 2,500 programs at agencies across the government. The instructions include a series of questions for agencies to answer about those programs, including whether they are affected by Trump’s revocation of funding for the US International Climate Finance Plan, impose what the document calls “an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources” or focus on environmental justice.\nThe order to freeze assistance reflects some of the goals of Project 2025, a policy blueprint written by conservatives for a second Trump administration that sought drastic funding cuts and reorganization of the federal government. Russell Vought, one of the blueprint’s coauthors, is Trump’s nominee to lead the office that issued the new order.\nLegal experts, government officials and others across the country were warning Tuesday that the memo could put in jeopardy everything from early childhood education and food assistance programs to efforts to clear land mines in war zones.\nThe list includes a wide array of environmental programs, from state efforts to install drinking water pipes and limit air pollution to disaster recovery programs.\nEnvironmental advocates warned that the order could have immediate and dire consequences for Americans if it takes effect.\n“From the White House, this is the reckless stroke of a pen,” said Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. “On the ground, it’s a cold home in the dead of winter. It’s a child going hungry at school. It’s a family that can’t pay the rent.

    "content_text": "“We're making new Pebble watches,” writes original Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky on the “rePebble” launch page.\nEight years after Pebble's time as an upstart watchmaker came to an end, Migicovsky says that he's working with a small team on “a Pebble-like smartwatch that runs open source PebbleOS.” There should be some new features, but new watches would stay “true to the core Pebble vision.” With enough sign-ups, the site claims, that watch gets built.\nPebble, launched in 2012, was one of the first smartphone-era smartwatches, selling 2 million models and serving as an early success story for hardware crowdfunding. After the relatively inexperienced hardware firm ran into funding gaps and stiff competition from the Apple Watch, Pebble stopped making its own watches after an IP-only sale to Fitbit in 2016. Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, gaining some original Pebble workers as well, who then helped the Rebble project launch replacement web services for the watch and kept the watch working on the newest Android phones.\nKeeping Things Simple\nWhy would someone want to make 2016's e-paper watches again? One big reason is that Google, pushed along by its in-house Pebble vets and Rebble volunteers, has released most of the source code for Pebble's operating system. It's missing some blobs of proprietary chipset and Bluetooth stack code, but it can be built, if not fully compiled. There is “a non-trivial amount of work to do in finding replacements” for those pieces, as well as bringing years-old source code up to date, Google's post notes. But anyone who wants to make a Pebble-ish watch can now use Pebble's code.\nWith that code, Migicovsky can address the second reason for a new Pebble—nothing has really replaced the original. On his blog, Migicovsky defines the core of Pebble's appeal: always-on screen, long battery life, a \"simple and beautiful user experience\" focused on useful essentials, physical buttons, and \"hackable,\" including custom watch faces.\nMigicovsky writes that a small team is tackling the hardware aspect, making a watch that runs PebbleOS and “basically has the same specs and features as Pebble” but with “fun new stuff as well.” Crucially, they're taking a different path than the original Pebble company:\nStill Not an Apple Watch—by Design\nArs Technica asked Migicovsky by email if modern-day Pebbles would have better interoperability with Apple's iPhones than the original models. “No, even less now!” Migicovsky replied, pointing to the Department of Justice's lawsuit against Apple in 2024. That lawsuit claims that Apple “limited the functionality of third-party smartwatches” to keep people using Apple Watches and then, as a result, less likely to switch away from iPhones.\nThe core functionality Migicovsky detailed on his post, he wrote, was still possible on iOS. Certain advanced features, like replying to notifications with voice dictation, may be limited to Android phones.\nMigicovsky's site and blog do not set a timeline for new hardware. His last major project, the multi-protocol chat app Beeper, was sold to WordPress.com owner Automattic in April 2024, following a protracted battle with Apple over access to its iMessage protocol.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "Brandon Russell, arguably one of the most influential figures in the American neofascist revival of the past decade, is on trial this week over an alleged plot to knock out Baltimore’s power grid and trigger a race war.\nThe 29-year-old cofounder of the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi guerrilla organization that was responsible for five homicides and a number of bomb plots before the FBI dismantled it in 2020, Russell was arrested by federal agents in February 2023 along with his girlfriend, Sarah Clendaniel. If convicted of his charges of conspiring to destroy an energy facility, Russell could face 20 years behind bars thanks to a prior conviction and the potential penalty for his current charges.\nRussell’s case represents one of the last gasps of the Biden administration’s hard-charging approach to tackling violent far-right extremism that is all but guaranteed to change during US president Donald Trump’s second term in office. It also offers a unique look inside federal law enforcement’s investigation into an insidious accelerationist propaganda network that mixes neo-Nazi ideology with nihilist, Columbine-style violence to inspire mass casualty events in the United States and beyond.\nRussell allegedly hatched the plot to black out Baltimore while, according to prosecutors, participating in a noxious, prolific propaganda network hellbent on fomenting violence and chaos. The Terrorgram Collective, which took its name following a massive influx of neo-Nazis to Telegram at the end of the last decade, ran several channels on the messaging app and developed a series of “how-to” domestic terrorism manuals that sought to inspire disaffected young men and women into committing mass casualty events. Terrorgram is currently designated a “tier one” extremism threat by the US Department of Justice.\nTo date, Terrorgram has released four publications—a blend of ideological motivation, mass-murder worship, neofascist indoctrination, and how-to manuals for chemical weapons attacks, infrastructure sabotage, and ethnic cleansing. Court records indicate there are at least three unreleased Terrorgram Collective compendiums, including “The Saint Encyclopedia” of the far-right mass killers they venerate, including Anders Breivik, Brenton Tarrant, and Timothy McVeigh; and “The List,” a collection of politicians, government officials, business leaders, journalists, activists, and other people deemed legitimate assassination targets.\nThe screeds appear to have directly inspired a series of ideologically motivated attacks around the world, including a 2022 mass shooting at an LGBTQ bar in Bratislava, Slovakia, successful attacks on power infrastructure in North Carolina and similar failed plots in Baltimore and New Jersey, and a stabbing spree in the Turkish city of Eskisehir. There are currently more than a dozen separate federal prosecutions around the United States that involve people alleged to be core Terrorgram Collective members or individuals allegedly inspired toward violent attacks on infrastructure or civilians.\nIn one of the Biden administration’s last policy moves against right-wing extremism, on January 13, the State Department formally classified the Terrorgram Collective as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a listing usually reserved for militant groups that hold territory and have a formal real-world paramilitary structure as opposed to a loose propaganda network that seeks to inspire mass casualty events. While it is not unique—the British Home Office formally proscribed Terrorgram as an extremist organization last May, and Russell’s Atomwaffen Division was banned by the UK, Australia, and Canada—it is likely to be the last such action taken toward neo-Nazi groups by the United States government for the foreseeable future.\nThe Trump administration appears to be engaged in a wholesale shift away from violent far-right extremism, best illustrated by the unprecedented pardons given to more than 1,500 individuals charged or convicted of crimes during the failed insurrection of January 6, 2021, as well as the reassignment of senior Justice Department attorneys in the National Security Division.\nIn a set of pretrial hearings and motions over the limits of evidence in Russell’s trial, federal prosecutors convinced US District Court judge James K. Bredar to allow in evidence of Russell’s deep neo-Nazi indoctrination, including background about his founding role in the Atomwaffen Division. Russell’s alleged involvement in the Terrorgram Collective is bolstered by a pendant allegedly recovered by FBI agents in a search of his home after his February 2023 arrest: The necklace is made of swastika-bearing beads that contains a larger golden swastika pendant with “Terrorgram” inscribed along the side.\nThe court is taking extra precautions as the US attempts to convict Russell. Journalists’ use of phones and laptops in the courtroom is forbidden, and the judge granted some witnesses permission to testify anonymously over fears of retaliation by Russell's compatriots, some of whom have indicated in Terrorgram chats cited in court filings that they have sought to identify informants and agents involved in their cases. Clendaniel, Russell’s girlfriend, pleaded guilty in May and was later sentenced to 18 years in federal prison. It is unclear whether she will be one of the witnesses testifying against Russell.\nThe prosecution of Russell also offers insight to how American law enforcement and intelligence agencies collaborate with their foreign counterparts to combat the transnational far-right milieu that spawned the Terrorgram Collective.\nIn an unusual alliance over the past two years, lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project weighed in on Russell’s behalf during pretrial motions in an effort to reveal evidence of warrantless surveillance of the fascist figurehead by either the National Security Agency or its counterparts. Although Judge Bredar ultimately denied the ACLU’s efforts on the grounds that the material was classified, the government’s response spoke volumes about the intelligence community’s role in surveilling Russell. American intelligence documents reviewed by WIRED show the Five Eyes alliance of American, Canadian, British, Australian and New Zealander intelligence agencies were keeping tabs on the Terrorgram Collective as far back as 2021.\nThe presence of Terrorgram Collective members in Croatia, Denmark, Slovakia, South Africa, Canada, and elsewhere overseas, coupled with the State Department’s designation of the propaganda network as a foreign terrorist organization, also point to additional reasons the group would be subjected to the highest level of official surveillance.\nRussell was on court supervision when he was picked up for the Baltimore plot nearly two years ago. In 2018, he was convicted on federal charges for possession of homemade hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, a highly unstable compound. He served a little over three years in prison and was released in August 2021. Russell’s arrest, in 2017, on illegal explosives charges, stemmed from a macabre internecine squabble within the Atomwaffen Division and a double homicide at the Tampa, Florida, apartment Russell shared with three other extremist comrades.\nUpdated 7:35 am EST, January 29, 2025: Corrected the maximum sentence Russell could receive if convicted.",

    "content_text": "Each year, about 185,000 people in the United States undergo amputation. Nearly half of those are due to injured blood vessels cutting off circulation to a limb. Surgeons can transplant an intact vein from somewhere else in a patient’s body to avoid amputation, but not everyone has a suitable vein to harvest.\nA new advance in tissue engineering could help. In December, the Food and Drug Administration approved a bioengineered blood vessel to treat vascular trauma. Made by North Carolina–based biotech company Humacyte, it’s designed to restore blood flow in patients with traumatic injuries, such as from gunshots, car accidents, industrial accidents, or combat.\n“Some patients are so badly injured that they don't have any veins available,” says Laura Niklason, founder and CEO of Humacyte. Even when a patient has a usable one, a vein often isn’t a good replacement for an artery. “Your veins are very thin. They're weak little structures, and your arteries are very strong,” she says.\nNiklason first became interested in the idea of growing spare blood vessels in the 1990s, when she was training to be a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. She remembers observing a patient undergoing a heart bypass, which involves using a healthy vessel to reroute blood flow around a blocked coronary artery. The surgeon opened up both of the patient’s legs, arms, and finally, the stomach, in search of a suitable blood vessel to use. “It was just really barbaric,” Niklason says. She figured there had to be a better way.\nShe started with growing blood vessels in the lab from just a few cells collected from pig arteries. When she transplanted them into the animal, they worked like the real thing.\nAfter those early experiments, it was a long road to an FDA-approved product for humans. Niklason and her team spent more than a decade isolating blood vessel cells from human organ and tissue donors. They tested cells from more than 700 donors and found that those from five of those donors were the most efficient at growing and expanding in the lab. Niklason says Humacyte now has enough cells banked from these five donors to make between 500,000 and a million engineered blood vessels.\nThe company currently makes the vessels in batches of 200, using custom-designed degradable polymer scaffolds that are 42 centimeters long and 6 millimeters thick. The scaffolds are placed in individual bags and seeded with millions of the donor cells. The bags then go into a school-bus-sized incubator to soak in a nutrient bath for two months. While the tissue grows, it secretes collagen and other proteins that provide structural support. Eventually, the polymer scaffold dissolves and the cells are washed away with a special solution. What’s left is “de-cellularized” flexible tissue in the shape of a blood vessel. Because it doesn’t contain living human cells, it won’t cause rejection when implanted into a patient.\n“People have been trying to come up with a tubular material like this one for a long time,” says Anton Sidawy, president-elect of the American College of Surgeons and a vascular surgeon at the George Washington University Medical Center, who isn’t involved with Humacyte.\nCurrently, synthetic alternatives made of Teflon or a type of polyester called Dacron are sometimes used when a patient doesn’t have an available blood vessel. But they’re not ideal. “Every time you put a foreign body in the human body, the chance of infection goes up. Bacteria love to sit on the foreign body and cause an infection,” Sidawy says.\nThe safety and effectiveness of the engineered vessel was tested in 51 civilian patients and 16 military patients with traumatic injuries, and the results were compared with previous studies of people who received synthetic versions. At 30 days after implantation, nearly 92 percent of the vessels remained open and functioning, compared with 79 percent for synthetic grafts. About 4.5 percent of patients required amputation, much lower than the 24 percent in tests of synthetic grafts. In addition, less than 1 percent of the bioengineered vessels became infected compared with more than 8 percent for the synthetic options. The results were published in the journal JAMA Surgery in November.\n“This actually becomes part of the patient's body,” says Michael Curi, chief of vascular surgery at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, who coauthored the paper. “The body grows its own cells into this vessel wall, and it mimics a natural vessel.”\nWhile the December approval means Humacyte’s vessel can only be used in trauma patients, the company is pursuing other uses for its technology. It has tested the bioengineered vessel in patients on kidney dialysis, which requires connecting an artery or vein to a dialysis machine, as well as in individuals with peripheral artery disease, when arteries in the legs or arms become blocked. In monkeys, a smaller version of the engineered blood vessel has also shown promise in treating heart bypass.\n“It’s truly a remarkable scientific achievement,” Curi says. “And in my opinion, it is the future of medicine.”",

    "content_text": "Elon Musk is only one week into his role in President Donald Trump’s new administration, but the US federal government is already rolling out the Twitter playbook to manage its spending and personnel. Just like Musk did when he took over the social media platform, Trump’s team is attempting to drastically reduce the number of government staffers and ensure those who remain are loyal to the president’s agenda.\nOn Tuesday, federal employees received an email that mirrors the “Fork in the Road” missive sent to Twitter (now X) staff shortly after Musk bought the company in 2022. The email asks federal workers to resign by February 6 if they do not wish to return to the office five days a week and commit to a culture of excellence. Those who choose to resign will continue to get pay and benefits until September, according to the memo.\n“The federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work,” reads the email, which was later published on the US Office of Personnel Management website. “Employees will be subject to enhanced standards of suitability and conduct as we move forward.”\nThe news comes as Musk’s minions take over the US Office of Personnel Management, which acts as a human resources department for the federal workforce. Elon Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. The Office of Personnel Management also did not respond to a request for comment.\nMusk and his advisors, including Trump’s newly appointed AI and crypto czar David Sacks, used a remarkably similar strategy at Twitter. About a week after the acquisition was complete, Musk laid off half the workforce. Sacks helped advise him on which teams and people would be cut.\nAbout two weeks later, remaining employees received an email with the subject line “A Fork in the Road.” Musk said that they would need to be “extremely hardcore” in order to realize his vision for Twitter 2.0. This meant “working long hours at high intensity.” He noted that \"only exceptional performance” would receive “a passing grade.\" Employees were asked to opt into this vision via a web form. Anyone who failed to do so by the following day would receive three months severance, Musk said. Thousands of Twitter employees would later sue, arguing that they were not paid their full severance. Musk ultimately was able to get the suit dismissed.\n“We are all shaking our heads in disbelief at how familiar this all feels,” says Yao Yue, a former principal engineer at Twitter. “Except, the federal government and its employees have specific laws in terms of spending, hiring, and firing.”\nIn this case, federal employees are being asked to send an email with the word “Resign” in the subject line in the next 10 days. “Purging the federal government of dedicated career civil servants will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government,” Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers, said in a statement. “This offer should not be viewed as voluntary. Between the flurry of anti-worker executive orders and policies, it is clear that the Trump administration's goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.”\nIn the wake of Musk’s ultimatum at Twitter, hundreds of employees resigned—many more than Musk had expected, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. The move caused widespread chaos inside the company as Musk’s lieutenants scrambled to figure out who simply hadn’t filled out the form yet and who was actually leaving the company. In some cases, Twitter employees who had quit were later called and asked to reconsider staying.\nOne former Twitter employee noted that the OPM letter appears slightly more buttoned up than the version they received years ago. “Clearly this was more thought out and went through lawyers unlike what they did with Twitter employees,” says a former engineering manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they do not want to incur Musk’s wrath. “I’m sickened to even be part of the connection honestly.”\nThe latest email from the Office of Personnel Management stresses that federal employees must return to the office five days a week, though some may be asked to move to new locations due to “meaningful consolidation and divestitures” of existing buildings. Musk has spoken repeatedly about his distaste for working from home—a practice he has called “morally wrong.” At Twitter, he told workers during an all hands meeting shortly after buying the company that if they could physically make it to an office and chose not to show up, their “resignation” would be accepted. Under former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, employees had been told they could work remotely forever.\nOn Monday, the US Office of Management and Budget (which encompasses Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE) sent a memo abruptly freezing all grants and loans disbursed by the federal government. “Federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal,” the memo read, according to NBC News.\nThis approach to spending—where a budget starts at zero, and employees have to justify every expense—is called “zero based budgeting,” and it too is a popular Musk tactic.\nOn Tuesday, a subreddit for federal employees was inundated with comments from people discussing the email. “Don’t trust this email, there is no guarantee they will pay you, and they most likely won’t!” wrote one user. “Look at what happened to Twitter employees.”",

    "content_text": "Centibillionaire Elon Musk’s takeover of the former US Digital Service—now the United States DOGE Service—has been widely publicized and sanctioned by one of President Donald Trump’s many executive orders. But WIRED reporting shows that Musk’s influence extends even further, and into an even more consequential government agency.\nSources within the federal government tell WIRED that the highest ranks of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)—essentially the human resources function for the entire federal government—are now controlled by people with connections to Musk and to the tech industry. Among them is a person who, according to an online résumé, was set to start college last fall.\nScott Kupor, a managing partner at the powerful investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, stands as Trump’s nominee to run the OPM. But already in place, according to sources, are a variety of people who seem ready to carry out Musk’s mission of cutting staff and disrupting the government.\nAmanda Scales is, as has been reported, the new chief of staff at the OPM. She formerly worked in talent for xAI, Musk’s artificial intelligence company, according to her LinkedIn. Before that, she was part of the talent and operations team at Human Capital, a venture firm with investments in the defense tech startup Anduril and the political betting platform Kalshi; before that, she worked for years at Uber. Her placement in this key role, experts believe, seems part of a broader pattern of the traditionally apolitical OPM being converted to use as a political tool.\n“I don't think it's alarmist to say there's a much more sophisticated plan to monitor and enforce loyalty than there was in the first term,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.\nGot a Tip?\nAre you a current or former employee with the Office of Personnel Management or another government agency impacted by Elon Musk? We’d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Vittoria Elliott at vittoria_elliott@wired.com or securely at velliott88.18 on Signal.\nSources say that Riccardo Biasini, formerly an engineer at Tesla and most recently director of operations for the Las Vegas Loop at the Boring Company, Musk’s tunnel-building operation, is also at the OPM as a senior adviser to the director. (Steve Davis, the CEO of the Boring Company, is rumored to be advising Musk on cuts to be made via DOGE and was integral in Musk’s gutting of Twitter, now X, after his takeover of the company in 2022.)\nAccording to the same sources, other people at the top of the new OPM food chain include two people with apparent software engineering backgrounds, whom WIRED is not naming because of their ages. One, a senior adviser to the director, is a 21-year-old whose online résumé touts his work for Palantir, the government contractor and analytics firm cofounded by billionaire Peter Thiel, who is its chair. (The former CEO of PayPal and a longtime Musk associate, Thiel is a Trump supporter who helped bankroll the 2022 Senate campaign of his protégé, Vice President JD Vance.) The other, who reports directly to Scales, graduated from high school in 2024, according to a mirrored copy of an online résumé and his high school’s student magazine; he lists jobs as a camp counselor and a bicycle mechanic among his professional experiences, as well as a summer role at Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company.\nAmong the new highers-up at the OPM is Noah Peters, an attorney whose LinkedIn boasts of his work in litigation representing the National Rifle Association and who has written for right-wing outlets like the Daily Caller and the Federalist; he is also now a senior adviser to the director. According to metadata associated with a file on the OPM website, Peters authored a January 27 memo that went out under acting OPM director Charles Ezell’s name describing how the department would be implementing one of Trump’s executive orders, “Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce.” This has to do with what’s sometimes known as Schedule F—a plan to recategorize many civil service jobs as political appointees, meaning they would be tied to the specific agenda of an administration rather than viewed as career government workers. The order would essentially allow for certain career civil servants to be removed in favor of Trump loyalists by classifying them as political appointees, a key part of the Project 2025 plan for remaking the government.\n“I think on the tech side, the concern is potentially the use of AI to try and engage in large-scale searches of people's job descriptions to try and identify who would be identified for Schedule F reclassification,” says Moynihan.\nOther top political appointees include McLaurine Pinover, a former communications director for Republican congressman Joe Wilson and deputy communications director for Republican congressman Michael McCaul, and Joanna Wischer, a Trump campaign speechwriter.\n“OPM is not a very politicized organization,” says Steven Kelman, a professor emeritus at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. “My guess is that typically, in the past, there have been only one or maybe two political appointees in all of OPM. All the rest are career. So this seems like a very political heavy presence in an organization that is not very political.”\nAnother OPM memo, concerning the government’s new return-to-office mandate, appears, according to metadata, also to have been authored by someone other than Ezell: James Sherk, previously at the America First Policy Institute and author of an op-ed advocating for the president to be able to fire bureaucrats. Formerly a special assistant to the president during Trump’s first term, he is now a part of the White House Domestic Policy Council.\nThe return-to-office policy, according to the November Wall Street Journal op-ed authored by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is explicitly geared toward forcing the attrition of federal employees.\nLast week, many federal workers received test emails from the email address HR@opm.gov. In a lawsuit filed last night, plaintiffs allege that a new email list started by the Trump administration may be compromising the data of federal employees.\n“At a broadest level, the concern is that technologists are playing a role to monitor employees and to target those who will be downsized,” says Moynihan. “It is difficult in the federal government to actually evaluate who is performing well or performing poorly. So doing it on some sort of mass automated scale where you think using some sort of data analysis or AI would automate that process, I think, is an invitation to make errors.”\nLast week, federal employees across the government received emails encouraging them to turn in colleagues who they believed to be working on diversity, equity, inclusion, and access initiatives (DEIA) to the OPM via the email address DEIAtruth@opm.gov.\n“This reminded me,” says Kelman, “of the Soviet Stalinism of turning in your friends to the government.”\nThe OPM did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the people whom sources say now sit atop the bureaucracy.\n“I am not an alarmist person,” says Kelman. “I do think that some of the things being described here are very troubling.”\nTim Marchman contributed reporting.",

    "content_text": "The volunteer cartographers who power the maps on platforms like Facebook, Lyft, and Strava have been intensely debating over the past week about whether to honor US president Donald Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. When should they update? Will the change affect all of the gulf, or just the US portion? Should it be reflected for everyone, or only Americans?\nThese are some of the questions the cartographers have been asking one another. Their discussions and edit wars provide a glimpse into the confusion over what may be one of the first orders of the new Trump administration generating visible changes across the internet.\nOn OpenStreetMap, a volunteer-run mapping platform that provides cartography data for a number of popular apps, online discussions show some contributors pushed to immediately update the gulf’s name to the Gulf of America. “This isn’t meant as vandalism, but more of starting the discussion,” one user wrote. They tried to make it only the name for English-speaking users, but the change was quickly rolled back by another contributor, who wrote, “Something isn't renamed just because a president says so.”\nThe original submitter replied, referring to Trump’s order, “Well, if he utters the idea in passing during a speech, that's one thing. But signing an EO and moving federal agencies to officially rename it is a vastly different thing. I hope you agree,” replied the original contributor. (They declined to comment beyond their post.)\nIn an executive order issued last Monday, Trump said that rebranding the gulf would recognize “this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our nation’s economy and its people.” He also ordered that Alaska’s tallest mountain, Denali, return to being known as Mount McKinley in recognition of former president William McKinley, whom Trump has said he admires. Critics have written off the moves as “very silly” and “petty.” Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum has said the body will continue to be known as the Gulf of Mexico to the rest of the world.\nOn Friday, the Department of the Interior announced that the new names had become official and federal agencies needed to update any relevant signage and paperwork. Private companies, however, aren’t required by law to follow suit. But on Monday, Google Maps became the first major mapping provider to publicly announce that it will switch to the new names for US users as soon as the federal government publishes them to a key database. “When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name,” Google wrote. “Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names.”\nDisputes over names and boundaries are common in the maps industry, with a number of countries having enacted laws requiring mapmakers to adopt specific titles and borders. Trump’s order, in particular, follows scant public input and is disputed even within the US.\nOpenStreetMap has various ways of labeling names. For instance, it’s possible to list Mexico as the colloquial name for the country while also displaying its official name, Estados Unidos Mexicanos, or United Mexican States. Other labels allow for different names to be shown in different countries and languages. Apps that license OpenStreetMap data can choose which of the labels to reflect to their users or add their own naming conventions.\nAltogether, around 10 attempts to change the gulf’s name have been reverted over the past week on OpenStreetMap. Several contributors have contended that OSM should wait for common usage in society to change before making an edit to the main name of the gulf. “OSM’s primary goal is to reflect what people on the ground believe is correct, striving for accuracy and neutrality in the face of diverse perspectives,” says Clifford Snow, a member of the organization’s Data Working Group who has reversed some of the edits allegedly made without consensus.\nA similar back-and-forth has played out over Denali. But reaching agreement may wind up proving difficult. “I do not believe that OSM will ever be able to pick one [name], without offending some user somewhere,” one contributor wrote. “We need a path out of this quagmire that does not involve edit wars.”\nOther contributors discussed when it would be appropriate to make the changes. Mapping providers, including Google, say they follow the US Geological Survey’s Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), but that database hasn’t been updated with the new names yet. Interior Department spokesperson Elizabeth Peace declined to speculate about when USGS staff might get around to processing the updates.\nUnder a 1947 law, decisions about which geographic names the US government will use are to be made by the secretary of the interior and the Board on Geographic Names, or BGN, a panel of officials from a smattering of government agencies. The GNIS is a repository of BGN-approved names.\nAs of Tuesday, at least one listed member of the BGN had received no correspondence or records related to changing the name of the gulf, according to a request filed by WIRED under the Freedom of Information Act. That suggests either that the usual mechanisms have not been engaged, or that some other authority is being exercised to change the official name. The Interior Department spokesperson declined to comment.\nAnother point of uncertainty has been whether the entire gulf should be renamed. The president’s order addressed “the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba.”\nBut as one contributor on OpenStreetMap wrote, “the Gulf of Mexico is much bigger than this. So it seems rather than a renaming, this executive order is creating a new name for a sub area of the Gulf of Mexico.”\nThe White House didn’t respond to WIRED’s request to clarify the intended boundaries for the new name. If the change were to apply to any non-US territory, the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency would have to update what’s known as the Geographic Names Server, a database of names for foreign locations. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency declined to comment.\nMikel Maron, a spokesperson for the OpenStreetMap Foundation, which helps steward the volunteer efforts, says the debate over the Trump order highlights the value of having an open community trying to represent the complexity of the world. For now, their discussion continues. “Ultimately the OSM Foundation Data Working Group has stepped in to put a hold on any big changes in the OSM database until things are more clear,” he says.\nSnow, the working group member, says the trending consensus is leaving the Gulf of Mexico and Denali as the primary names and adding a label to each for the new official US name. But if Gulf of America catches on, the open source map may have to follow.\nAdditional reporting by Tim Marchman.",

Dell is offering a healthy discount on the Alienware AW3225QF, an impressively equipped gaming panel that will give even the Nvidia RTX 5090 Founders Edition (7/10, WIRED Recommends ) some room to breathe.\nAlienware tends to have pronounced styling, with this screen in particular sporting rounded edges and light-colored panels. If that bothers you, the stand is replaceable for any VESA 100 x 100 mount, and it's not like you'll see the back while using it anyway.\nAt the heart of this gaming monitor, you'll find a slightly curved 4K QD-OLED panel, which should result in deeper, darker black levels, as well as beautifully rich colors. While 32 inches might not be the largest panel size, I think it strikes a nice balance between pixel density and usability. The 240-Hz refresh rate is among the highest available at that resolution, which should give this screen plenty of life over the next few years.\nFor anyone who can't quite keep up with the 240-Hz refresh rate right now, the Alienware has Nvidia G-Sync. This adaptive refresh technology keeps your display's panel tied to the frame rate of the game you're playing, reducing tearing and flickering when the two don't line up. While G-Sync only works with Nvidia graphics cards, AMD users can still take advantage of the VESA AdaptiveSync standard, which has the same core functionality.\nI also appreciate both the inputs provided here, as well as the included cables.

All of the best TVs support 4K, as do most new TV shows and movies, with the exception of traditional broadcasting—and even that is poised to make the jump (eventually). Riding alongside 4K's resolution revolution is HDR (high dynamic range), another exciting video enhancement that's arguably even more impactful to your viewing experience than 4K.\nBut what is HDR, and why is it so integral to getting the best out of modern TVs? It's a common misconception that HDR simply makes things brighter, but it does so much more than that. HDR's key advantage is improved contrast, providing brighter brights, darker darks, and a more expansive color palette to make everything you watch look more realistic. Not all HDR is created equal, however, and you need the proper hardware and video content to take advantage. Here's everything you need to know about HDR to get the most out of your TV time.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nWhat Is HDR for TVs?\nNot to be confused with the camera format of the same name, HDR for TV is both a video and a hardware technology. It requires an HDR-compatible TV and an HDR content source to do its thing. As the name implies, HDR provides a more expansive (and yes, dynamic) range of contrast and colors than its predecessor, SDR (standard dynamic range). This doesn’t mean HDR video makes your TV brighter—rather, it helps to unlock your TV’s brightness potential.\nAt its most basic, HDR content provides a road map for your 4K HDR TV to follow. To an extent, the brighter your TV can get, the more impactful your HDR experience will be. This has its limitations, constrained by both your TV’s maximum or “peak” brightness—the brightest your TV gets in small windows and highlights—and the brightness at which the content was originally mastered.\nAs a general guideline, you'll want a TV with a peak brightness of at least 500 nits (a unit for measuring display brightness) to experience HDR's impact. That shouldn't be difficult, considering that even budget TVs these days regularly meet or surpass that level. That said, HDR's impact is also highly affected by your TV's total contrast, the difference between the brightest and darkest images. For example, HDR content on an OLED TV that provides perfect black levels will look more impactful than on a brighter LED TV with poor black levels and contrast.\nUnlike with SDR content, your HDR TV’s lighting system will be set at full power when viewing HDR content. That’s because video mastered in HDR provides more information to your TV by better adhering to the creator’s intent, so you won't just be blasted with brightness. Instead, HDR video is designed to take full advantage of what your HDR TV can do, coaxing darker black levels and richer shadow detail, brighter and more intense highlights, and more expressive colors thanks to its higher “range” of contrast and color shading than SDR video.\nHDR Formats: HDR10, Dolby Vision, HDR10+\nHDR comes in a variety of formats, from the basic open-source version, HDR10, to the one you've probably heard most about, Dolby Vision. Every HDR TV and content source supports HDR10, so even if you’re watching an HDR video in a format your TV doesn’t support, you’ll still reap the benefits of HDR. The biggest difference comes down to how the HDR metadata is implemented.\nHDR10 is a “static” HDR format, meaning it sets the HDR range for your TV to follow at the outset and doesn't change. Dolby Vision, on the other hand, is a dynamic format that can adjust a compatible TV's HDR road map on the fly for a more finely tuned performance from scene to scene or even frame by frame. Dolby Vision video usually generates its own picture mode on your TV, one that's often more constrained than other formats due to Dolby's specifications. You’ll hear a lot about Dolby Vision's superiority over other formats, and it's the most prevalent dynamic format on most streaming services right now.\nSome TVs, like those made by Samsung, don't support Dolby Vision. Samsung, Panasonic, and 20th Century Fox created their own dynamic HDR format called HDR10+ which, unlike Dolby Vision, is royalty-free. Like its cousin, HDR10+ provides a compatible HDR TV with more finely tuned contrast and color adjustments when viewing supported content than standard HDR10.\nAll things being equal, you're unlikely to see a major performance difference between the two formats right now. Both support the highest peak brightness and color bit depth of the current TV pipeline, at 4,000 nits and 10-bits respectively (more on that below). Dolby advertises support for up to 10,000 nits peak brightness and 12-bit color depth, but since you won't find much (if any) supported content for those specs, any major differences are mostly theoretical at present. The biggest HDR performance boost is more likely to come from the quality of your TV panel and its internal processing. Even basic HDR10 content will look leaps and bounds better than similar SDR content on a great TV.\nOne other HDR format to know is HLG (Hybrid-log Gamma). Developed by the BBC and NHK, this format is royalty-free like HDR10 and HDR10+. It was developed for broadcast TV and is designed to be backward compatible with SDR TVs. Because you'll rarely find HDR broadcasts in the US right now this format is rare, but like HDR10, it's supported by virtually all HDR TVs.\nWhat Is Wide Color Gamut?\nAlongside enhanced resolution, modern 4K HDR TVs allow for more expansive color shading and a higher color bit depth. Where previous displays maxed out around 16.77 million color hues (8-bit depth), today's best TVs can display up to 1.07 billion hues (10-bit depth), also called Wide Color Gamut (WCG). HDR can enhance WCG, as its higher luminance range provides a better display of the full range of colors available in the current TV ecosystem.\nWCG's expanded color spectrum is measured using more advanced display color standards than the previous Rec. 709 standard. These currently include DCI-P3 and the superior BT.2020 (aka Rec 2020), which covers an even wider color space than DCI-P3. It can all get pretty complicated, but the bottom line is, with better brightness and contrast comes the ability to display a higher range of colors. The closer a 4K HDR TV or display gets to producing the full spectrum of the BT.2020 standard, the more vivid and realistic its colors will look.\nAlong with richer and more expressive colors, today's best HDR TVs allow for more intricate shading between colors with WCG content. This allows for images that look more like what we see in real life with less “banding” or visible distortion between color hues. Banding is especially noticeable in images like a fiery sunset or a brightly colored object against a dark background. Banding is still relatively common in HDR, especially with compressed streaming video or lower-quality TVs. You'll get the best colors, contrast, and overall HDR quality from 4K HDR Blu-rays or video files from services like Sony Pictures Core.\nWhere Can I Find HDR Content?\nHDR is now available in a ton of places, from streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, Max, and Amazon Prime to games on systems like the PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series X and S, and PCs. HDR video is often bundled with 4K resolution, but that's not always the case, especially for live broadcasts. Amazon Prime's Thursday Night Football, for instance, is broadcast in HDR but its resolution is currently constrained to 1080p HD likely due to the challenges of 4K video file sizes.\nWhile 4K HDR Blu-rays provide the best HDR experience right now, it's not clear for how much longer. You can find virtually every new film on 4K HDR Blu-ray, some of which (like Mad Max: Fury Road) push HDR to its current limits, but Blu-ray players are becoming increasingly less common. Only a few brands still sell them in the US, including Sony and Panasonic, which makes some of our favorite models. For testing purposes, we use Panasonic's DP-UB820-K and the fancier DP-UB9000, in part because they support all major Blu-ray HDR formats.\nHowever you get your HDR, it's well worth the upgrade. From deeper and more impactful contrast to vastly superior color shading, high dynamic range is arguably the most exciting element in modern display technology, allowing for a more natural and immersive viewing experience. As we move into the next stage of display innovation, from the way video is shot and mastered to the panels on which it's displayed, HDR will help lead the way. And its future is only getting brighter.",

More than 2.1 million battery-powered vehicles are driving around the state, and last fall, over a quarter of new cars sold there were electric. Lawmakers are trying to ensure the future holds even more. In December, California received special permission from the US government to enact regulations that would require automakers to sell only zero-emission new vehicles in the state by 2035.\nThe permission, in the form of a federal “waiver,” should extend well beyond California’s borders. Seventeen other states have said they would follow California’s lead on stricter emissions standards, with 11 targeting the 2035 gas car phase-out. Together, these states account for more than 40 percent of US new light-duty vehicle registrations.\nOr maybe not. Last week, in a wide-ranging executive order targeting green energy policies, the Trump administration said it would seek to “terminate” state emissions waivers “that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles.” The order, at this point more political messaging document than anything with the force of law, puts California’s clean car goals in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. Whoever wins this fight could determine the future of electric vehicles not just in the US, but—given the number of vehicles both sold and made in the country—globally, too.\nThe Trump administration has not yet officially moved to revoke the waiver, but California says it will not back away from its more stringent vehicle emissions standards. “California will continue to defend its longstanding right and obligation to protect the health of its residents,” Liane Randolph, the chair of California’s emissions regulating agency, the Air Resources Board, wrote in a statement.\nOld Fight\nIf this all sounds familiar, that’s because the country has sort of been through this before.\nCalifornia’s waiver dates back to 1967, when congressional lawmakers decided to create a special California exemption within national air regulations because the state had such a thorny air pollution problem, and because it had been a pioneer in regulation, creating its own vehicle emissions regulations for more than a decade. Since then, California has applied for more than 100 waivers.\nIn 2019, President Donald Trump announced by tweet that his administration would revoke the California waiver allowing it to set its own auto emissions standards. The move, he said then, would increase auto safety and create “JOBS JOBS JOBS.” But even as the first Trump administration moved to withdraw California’s waiver, state lawmakers struck a deal with four global automakers—Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW—to preserve some auto emissions standards.\nAutomakers were willing to come to the table with California six years ago because they feared a market in which they must make two sets of vehicles—one cleaner fleet for the California-and-its-allies market, and another for the rest of the country.\nThe California market is large enough that even automakers with headquarters far from the US are paying attention to how this shakes out. The state’s aggressive stance towards climate regulation would require automakers lagging on electrification to race to catch up. Toyota, for example, has argued that consumers aren’t ready for battery electrics, and followed a strategy that has seen the automaker churn out more hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Last year, an executive for Toyota Motor North America said the California rules “look impossible.” But keeping those rules in place would require Toyota to invest more in getting electric vehicles on the road.\nThe Biden administration reissued the waiver in 2022. Last year, it approved a new California program allowing the state to, over the course of a decade, ratchet up the share of zero-emission cars sold in the state. Under the rules, 35 percent of model year 2026 cars must be zero-emission; 68 percent of model year 2030 must hit that goal. The state says the rules will, by 2037, reduce light-duty vehicle emissions by a quarter. Automakers will be able to use plug-in hybrid vehicles, not just all-electric ones, to reach their goals.\nThis month, the country’s lead auto lobbyist seemed to praise the Trump administration’s new waiver threat. “There’s a mismatch between current EV market dynamics and the emissions and EV sales targets called for in recent regulations—especially in the states that adopted California’s gas-powered vehicle ban and EV sales requirements,” John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, wrote in a statement. He called the California rules “by any measure not achievable.”\nLegal Tussle\nBecause the feds approved this particular waiver before President Joe Biden left office, revoking California's zero-emission car rules will prove legally tricky for Trump, and cannot be done by fiat. The US Environmental Protection Agency will have to go through a months-long public rulemaking process to nix the waiver. If the federal government goes through with revoking it, experts say, that move will be challenged in court.\nAny effort to get rid of California’s 2035 rules “stands on shaky legal footing,” says Julia Stein, the deputy director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA’s School of Law. For one thing, California’s special waiver ability is explicitly written into the landmark Clean Air Act. And the state needs the vehicle emissions rules to achieve its federal ambient air quality standards. Some 10 million people in the San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles areas live where ozone levels are far above federal rules, and suffer from higher than average rates of asthma and heart disease.\n“Zero-emission vehicles are a critical part of the plan to protect Californians,” the California Air Resources Board says.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIn the five years since its launch, Bookshop.org has amassed quite the loyal following. The online retailer shares its sales revenue with bookstores around the US, and has become a popular destination for online customers who would rather help keep their local bookstore in business than send money to big retailers like Amazon. Until now, Bookshop has found success through the sale of physical books. Today, Bookshop is expanding its efforts into the digital realm.\nBookshop.org officially sells ebooks now. Or, as the company would put it, Bookshop now enables local bookstores to sell those ebooks themselves through its marketplace. The company launched its official ebook platform today, complete with an app (on Android and iOS) for shopping and reading digital books.\nBookstores can use the platform to sell ebooks directly to customers, and when they make a sale, the store gets all of the money. Customers can also browse all of the ebooks for sale on the website, then choose which bookstore to support with their purchase. In that case as well, the chosen bookstore gets all the money. (If the customer doesn't pick a store to support, Bookshop puts a chunk of the profits into a sharing pool that's distributed among independent stores, but keeps the rest to fund its operation.)\nBookshop CEO Andy Hunter sees a burning need for a better way to buy ebooks.\n“It’s crazy that bookstores can’t sell ebooks to their customers right now,” Hunter says. He says he wants this program to continue his company’s mission of propping up local bookstores, but he also hopes this move will help take Amazon down a peg as well.\n“I know tons of people who love their local bookstore, support them in every other way, but when they need an ebook, they have to go to Amazon to buy that ebook even if they love and support their local bookstore and have ethical concerns about Amazon. We want to change that.”\nBookshop launched in January 2020, mere weeks before the world shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Physical book stores, like many IRL retailers, faced an existential threat when great masses of people shuttered themselves indoors. Many stores had already been struggling against the Goliaths of Amazon, Walmart, and Target well before pandemic restrictions drove more purchases online. Bookshop landed at just the right time to provide something of a crutch for struggling bookstores and offer an alternative to funneling more money into Amazon’s maw.\nIt may not have saved every bookstore or toppled any ecommerce empires, but Bookshop has done quite well—and proven popular among readers eager to support independent stores. At the time of this writing, Bookshop says it has raised more than $35 million for local bookstores.\n“Everybody wants diversity in the landscape,” Hunter says. “Whether you like Amazon or not, everybody understands it’s a healthier market for books when you have a whole bunch of players selling and in competition with each other.”\nThere are some other places to buy ebooks that support independent sellers—a handful of small publishers sell ebooks directly, and the ebook retailer Kobo has an affiliate program that sends a percentage of your ebook purchase to your favorite local bookstore—but Bookshop’s one-stop shop is a unique experience that adds a needed layer of convenience.\nRights and Wrongs\nThe copyright and ownership arguments around ebooks are sticky. Unlike physical books, which you can freely loan out or resell, digital books have more draconian restrictions placed on them by both publishers and marketplaces. Amazon, for instance, has a proprietary ebook file type that can only be opened by a Kindle device, or within the Kindle app. Publishers also tend to hold on to the rights on their ebooks, which limits what customers can do with the titles they purchase.\nCara Gagliano, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who focuses on copyright law, also cautions that ebooks are almost always just licensed to the reader—even when you buy an ebook, you don’t actually own the ebook itself. If something goes wrong with that publisher, or if it decides to pull its ebooks from retailers’ stores, then you run the risk of losing access to the book you bought.\n“The problem with a licensing model is that it gives them the ability to include terms that go beyond copyright law,” Gagliano says. “We've especially been looking into the use of end user license agreements and terms of service to try to expand copyright. So you might also find you’re limited in other ways.”\nIt is these kinds of machinations that Hunter hopes will entice people to use Bookshop instead. The new marketplace is not exactly the anti-Amazon, and there are some caveats. First, many ebooks you can buy on Bookshop are in an e-pub format that cannot be loaded directly onto Amazon’s Kindle devices, which are the most popular e-readers in the world. Second, some books will have digital rights management restrictions that publishers use to limit how a book can be distributed. If the books don’t have DRM, then you can swap that book between devices. If it does have DRM, then you can’t.\nGagliano says the solution to these kinds of problems is only likely to be reached through some kind of legislative action. Hunter knows that won’t happen overnight, but he hopes his new store will push things in the right direction.\n“The first step is to launch the platform,” Hunter says. “Our second step is to make it popular, so we have leverage. And then we can start fixing what we consider to be the industry problems around ebooks.”\nBuying an ebook on Bookshop.org works a little differently than buying a physical book on the platform. Shipping physical books requires storage and labor, so Bookshop takes a cut of the proceeds from sales. For physical books, Bookshop lets buyers direct 30 percent of the proceeds of a sale to their favorite participating bookstore. An additional 10 percent of those sales, plus the sales of books that are not earmarked for a specific store, gets split up and distributed to every store on Bookshop's platform.\nEbook sales through Bookshop, however, will see 100 percent of the proceeds going to the store that sells them through the platform. If a user buys an ebook directly from Bookshop without naming a bookstore they want to support, then a third of that profit will go into the pool of funds that gets divided between stores. The rest will go to pay for Bookshop.org’s engineers and server costs.\nHearts and Minds\nPerhaps the biggest thing Bookshop’s new model is going to have to contend with is what Gagliano describes as “lock in.” Many readers may already have so many books in their Kindle library that it could be hard to just move to a new platform. It’s sort of like the effort of making a switch from a Mac to a PC. The more costs you’ve sunk into a particular ecosystem, the harder it is to pry yourself out.\nHunter gets that, but his hope is that his app is good enough to make the jump—and that people will see the extra value in keeping their local bookshops around. He views it as an important, almost existential step.\n“There’s a future that we’re all getting pulled into where technology and people and governments that don’t have our best interests at heart and don’t have humanity’s best interests at heart and are putting their own agendas ahead of the general good of humanity,” Hunter says.\nHe sees independent bookstores as bastions of community—places in small towns or big cities where people can meet, share culture and knowledge, and make roots. Keeping them in business is good for everyone.\n“It’s motivating, being able to make a difference, even as the ground erodes beneath our feet,” Hunter says. “We’re trying to replenish the topsoil and keep the sustainable systems around the culture of reading and writing strong.”",

    "content_text": "A powerful new open-source artificial intelligence model created by Chinese startup DeepSeek has shaken Silicon Valley over the past few days. Packed with cutting-edge capabilities and developed on a seemingly tiny budget, DeepSeek’s R1 is prompting talk of an impending upheaval in the tech industry.\nTo some people, DeepSeek’s rise signals that the US has lost its edge in AI. But a number of experts, including executives at companies that build and customize some of the world’s most powerful frontier AI models, say it's a sign of a different kind of technological transition underway.\nInstead of trying to create larger and larger models that require increasingly exorbitant amounts of computing resources, AI companies are now focusing more on developing advanced capabilities, like reasoning. That has created an opening for smaller, innovative startups such as DeepSeek that haven’t received billions of dollars in outside investment. “It’s a paradigm shift towards reasoning, and that will be much more democratized,” says Ali Ghodsi, CEO of Databricks, a company that specializes in building and hosting custom AI models.\n“It’s been clear for some time now that innovating and creating greater efficiencies—rather than just throwing unlimited compute at the problem—will spur the next round of technology breakthroughs,” says Nick Frosst, a cofounder of Cohere, a startup that builds frontier AI models. “This is a clarifying moment when people are realizing what's long been obvious.”\nThousands of developers and AI enthusiasts flocked to DeepSeek’s website and its official app in recent days to try out the company’s latest model and shared examples of its sophisticated capabilities on social media. Shares in US tech firms, including the chipmaker Nvidia, fell in response on Monday as investors began to question the vast sums being poured into AI development.\nDeepSeek’s technology was developed by a relatively small research lab in China that sprang out of one of the country’s best-performing quantitative hedge funds. A research paper posted online last December claims that its earlier DeepSeek-V3 large language model cost only $5.6 million to build, a fraction of the amount its competitors needed for similar projects. OpenAI has previously said that some of its models cost upwards of $100 million each. The latest models from OpenAI as well as Google, Anthropic, and Meta likely cost considerably more.\nThe performance and efficiency of DeepSeek’s models has already prompted talk of cost cutting at some big tech firms. One engineer at Meta, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly, says the tech giant will most likely try to examine DeepSeek’s techniques to find ways to reduce its own expenditure on AI. “We believe open source models are driving a significant shift in the industry, and that’s going to bring the benefits of AI to everyone faster,” a spokesperson for Meta said in a statement. “We want the US to continue to be the leader in open source AI, not China, which is why Meta is developing open source AI with our Llama models which have been downloaded over 800 million times.”\nThe true price of developing DeepSeek’s new models remains unknown, however, since one figure quoted in a single research paper may not capture the full picture of its costs. “I don't believe it's $6 million, but even if it's $60 million, it's a game changer,” says Umesh Padval, managing director of Thomvest Ventures, a company that has invested in Cohere and other AI firms. “It will put pressure on the profitability of companies which are focused on consumer AI.”\nShortly after DeepSeek revealed the details of its latest model, Ghodsi of Databricks says customers began asking whether they could use it as well as DeepSeek’s underlying techniques to cut costs at their own organizations. He adds that one approach employed by DeepSeek’s engineers, known as distillation, which involves using the output from one large language model to train another model, is relatively cheap and straightforward.\nPadval says that the existence of models like DeepSeek's will ultimately benefit companies looking to spend less on AI, but he says that many firms may have reservations about relying on a Chinese model for sensitive tasks. So far, at least one prominent AI firm, Perplexity, has publicly announced it's using DeepSeek’s R1 model, but it says it is being hosted “completely independent of China.”\nAmjad Massad, the CEO of Replit, a startup that provides AI coding tools, told WIRED that he thinks DeepSeek’s latest models are impressive. While he still finds Anthropic’s Sonnet model is better at many computer engineering tasks, he has found that R1 is especially good at turning text commands into code that can be executed on a computer. “We’re exploring using it especially for agent reasoning,” he adds.\nDeepSeek’s latest two offerings—DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek R1-Zero—are capable of the same kind of simulated reasoning as the most advanced systems from OpenAI and Google. They all work by breaking problems into constituent parts in order to tackle them more effectively, a process that requires a considerable amount of additional training to ensure that the AI reliably reaches the correct answer.\nA paper posted by DeepSeek researchers last week outlines the approach the company used to create its R1 models, which it claims perform on some benchmarks about as well as OpenAI’s groundbreaking reasoning model known as o1. The tactics DeepSeek used include a more automated method for learning how to problem-solve correctly as well as a strategy for transferring skills from larger models to smaller ones.\nOne of the hottest topics of speculation about DeepSeek is the hardware it might have used. The question is especially noteworthy because the US government has introduced a series of export controls and other trade restrictions over the last few years aimed at limiting China’s ability to acquire and manufacture cutting-edge chips that are needed for building advanced AI.\nIn a research paper from August 2024, DeepSeek indicated that it has access to a cluster of 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, which were placed under US restrictions announced in October 2022. In a separate paper from June of that year, DeepSeek stated that an earlier model it created called DeepSeek-V2 was developed using clusters of Nvidia H800 computer chips, a less capable component developed by Nvidia to comply with US export controls.\nA source at one AI company that trains large AI models, who asked to be anonymous to protect their professional relationships, estimates that DeepSeek likely used around 50,000 Nvidia chips to build its technology.\nNvidia declined to comment directly on which of its chips DeepSeek may have relied on. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement,” a spokesman for Nvidia said in a statement, adding that the startup's reasoning approach “requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.”\nHowever DeepSeek’s models were built, they appear to show that a less closed approach to developing AI is gaining momentum. In December, Clem Delangue, the CEO of HuggingFace, a platform that hosts artificial intelligence models, predicted that a Chinese company would take the lead in AI because of the speed of innovation happening in open source models, which China has largely embraced. “This went faster than I thought,” he says.",

    "content_text": "Karen Tautges Malinak watches her herd of 20 goats from the kitchen window as she waits for her family to arrive. It’s a clear summer day in Independence, Minnesota—population 3,644, half an hour outside Minneapolis. She holds a pink coffee mug in her hands. “Moms make everything better,” it reads.\nKaren’s life revolves around her farm, which is also the home base for her goat soap business, Rapha Farms. It’s easier for her family to visit her here than it is for her to leave the goats. As we lean against her cluttered kitchen counter, Karen, who is 58, tucks her bobbed silver hair behind an ear and checks the time. “They should be here soon,” she says, her vowels drawn out by her native Minnesota accent. I feel as if I’m in some sort of rural sitcom: I’m due to meet each of Karen’s four daughters, four sons-in-law, and 12 grandchildren over the next two days. Although I’ve spoken to many of them on the phone, I have a strange feeling that almost anyone could walk through the door.\nAdding to the strangeness, Karen and her husband Dave only recently moved to this farm. Because their workshop remains under construction, the soap-making happens wherever there’s space. The living room is filled with racks of finished bars, labeled by scent: tea tree, lilac, lemongrass. Silicon molds cover a long table, and vats of essential oils line the walls. The small kitchen is stacked high with hand blenders; taped to the floor is a sign that says “Poop buckets here.” (One of the joys of working with goats.) There is no room for furniture, hardly space to walk. Where, then, to put the family that will soon arrive?\nAs if on cue, a driveway sensor chimes: Karen’s daughter Michelle, along with her husband and two sons, pulls in. Highlighter shimmers on Michelle’s cheekbones. Her boys, aged 9 and 7, hop out of the car and hand over gifts: a jigsaw puzzle for Dave and a handmade condolence card for Karen. The day before, Karen had to put down Angel, her elderly Maltese.\nKaren pins the card on her refrigerator, beneath a photo of three other grandsons—boys who Michelle, her husband, and her sons have never actually met. That’s because Michelle and her brood aren’t, exactly, Karen’s real family. In fact, none of the people I’m supposed to meet on this visit have any blood relation to Karen. They are families she found online and “adopted” as a surrogate grandmother in the lonely years after her own biological daughters turned her away.\nKaren and Michelle met in November 2023 on a Facebook group called Surrogate Grandparents USA, a place where older and younger Americans connect over a mutual need for family. Many of the posts read like tiny, tragic personal ads:\n“We want grandparents who want to have pizza nights with us, attend baseball and basketball games, have ice cream dates, take bike rides, just genuinely have fun with us and our boys.”\n“My children need more than just me to love them. I can’t be their mama, daddy, aunt, uncle, grandma and grandpa forever! We joke about it, but it’s true and it sits as a pit in my stomach.”\n“One lonely grandma here. I would love to share affection and attention with a nearby family.”\nDonna Skora, a 68-year-old retired paralegal from Summerfield, Florida, created Surrogate Grandparents USA in 2015. “Everybody needs some kind of support system, emotionally,” she tells me. Some members of the group have lost loved ones, while others have never had families of their own. But what the group really represents, Donna says, is a refuge for the estranged. “I realized it was a growing problem, not only in the United States but worldwide.” Scrolling through the messages only confirms this: Many of the posters report being the victims—or initiators—of estrangement.\nToday, around 27 percent of American adults have cut off contact with a family member—one of the highest estrangement rates in the world. And it seems to be on the rise, according to Joshua Coleman, the psychologist and author of the buzzy 2021 book Rules of Estrangement. “Online support groups, Instagram influencers, TikTok influencers,” Coleman says, “all are huge contributors to this phenomenon.” While estrangement has always existed—abuse and divorce are common causes, as are disagreements over money, religion, sexual orientation, and politics—“never before was it characterized as a pathway to personal growth and identity the way it is today,” he says. But just as social media can lead to alienation, it can also bring people together. After all, Coleman runs his own private Facebook group for estranged parents and grandparents.\nI’ll be the first to say it: Facebook? Yes. It might seem lame to younger generations, but Facebook, whose monthly user base comprises a third of the human population, remains a behemoth. It also remains one of the better places online to form and maintain genuine connections. Many of us have been on Facebook for decades, using our real names, checking on our real relatives, posting photos from our real lives, and “friending” our real friends.\nSurrogate Grandparents USA attracted a mere 30 members in its first six months. The group was only as useful as its size—the more members there were, the easier it’d be to find matches. So Donna posted dozens of free ads and contacted local TV stations. By 2019, the group had 3,700 members. Today, it has more than 11,000.\nKaren has two biological daughters. When she divorced their dad in 2019, the eldest, then a college student, cut Karen out of her life. The dad had autism and a brain injury—the older daughter felt Karen had an obligation to him. Karen, meanwhile, felt emotionally abused in the relationship. “She sided with him,” Karen says. Four years later, in 2023, Karen’s younger daughter, with her older sister’s help, left too. The split was a heartbreaking final dissolution, Karen’s family of four whittled to two: Karen and Dave, her second husband. “I stopped sleeping for a month,” Karen says. “It was devastating.”\nBut, soon enough, she figured she needed to move on. “I knew I had gotten through it before,” she says. “I’m not going to live my life being sad, and there are people out there who want relationships with people like me.” That’s when she found Surrogate Grandparents USA.\nKaren lurked on the group for six months before deciding to post a message. “I’d love a mother/daughter relationship, and we are hoping for grandkids,” she wrote. “We have a goat farm … so lots of fun for kids.” The premise didn’t feel so strange to Karen. As a girl, she’d been taken under the wing of her childless next-door neighbors. They took her to a lakeside cabin each summer and bought her presents—a bike, jewelry, glass animals. When they died, Karen inherited the majority of their estate. So why couldn’t something similar happen again? Karen added a selfie to her Facebook post, along with a photo of her and the goats. Ten women responded.\nOne was Michelle. Michelle’s sisters had recommended the group to her—their mother had died six years earlier, and Michelle didn’t have family nearby. She longed for someone to watch her boys’ sports games or take them out to dinner. For a few years, she had watched as Facebook posts flooded in. Nobody was ever located nearby. Until Karen.\nConnecting was, Karen says, “almost like online dating.” They DM’d first, before progressing to texting, calling, and finally arranging to meet up IRL. The group’s moderators encourage people to vet prospective surrogates. Michelle didn’t do that, though she did browse Karen’s social media. It was, needless to say, goat-heavy.\nThey met at a Panera Bread for lunch. Michelle was eager for Karen to like her—the stakes felt high. “I literally had pink eye at the time,” Michelle says, “and I was like, ‘I’m not this ugly, I promise.’” With the holidays on the horizon, they felt the absence of their loved ones. “We both cried at some point,” Michelle says.\nBiological families often have a sense of obligation to spend time together, as well as a lifetime of shared experiences. Not so with surrogate grandparents and their surrogate adult children, who need to become actual friends. Karen and Michelle bonded over their loss and their shared faith as Christians but didn’t involve the boys until they were mutually serious about pursuing the connection. It, indeed, became serious. Karen’s pink coffee mug? A Mother’s Day gift from Michelle.\nAfter introductions, Karen, Michelle, and I suggest moving outside. The kids complain about the bugs that hum up from Karen’s lawn. “I’m not an outside person,” announces the 9-year-old, who wears a shirt with bearded dragons on it. Karen had warned me that these “city kids” are a little less rough-and-tumble than some of her other surrogate grandchildren. I suspect the boys are being dramatic.\nMichelle says that her sisters, who live far away, would also benefit from surrogate grandparents like Karen and Dave, and she hopes they find their own matches. (As she tells me this, I swipe a mosquito off my arm.) Michelle and Dave have connected over their love of Naked and Afraid, and Karen and Dave watch the boys’ soccer games. (I swat a blood sucker from a sliver of bare ankle.) They all celebrated one of the boys’ birthdays recently with a trip to a malt shop, where they split two family-size portions of fries. (I slap a monstrous bug as it lands on my forehead. Listen to the children, I note, for they are wise.) I can tell there’s a real relationship developing between Karen and this family. When we go back inside, Karen hands the brothers a basket of soap samples. “There’s watermelon this time,” she says, and the 7-year-old squeals. That’s the parting ritual, it seems. Michelle and her family say their goodbyes and head out.\nNext up in the rotating door of surrogate families: a woman named MeLea and her three sons. I know, it’s a lot of names to remember. And they all sound sort of similar. Three of Karen’s surrogate daughters have M names: Michelle, MeLea, and Meghan. It’s become a bit of a joke between her and Dave: “You know, it really makes me angry that you named them all starting with the letter M,” he likes to say. Karen maintains a spreadsheet with the ages, birthdays, and interests of a dozen surrogate grandkids ranging in age from 1 to 13.\nMeLea is supposed to meet us at Karen’s house, but she gets busy and asks us to come to her place instead. As we pull up, MeLea’s father-in-law stands outside. He’s there helping the family with some home-improvement tasks. I wonder if this biological grandparent feels weird about encountering a surrogate. He raises a hand. “I’ve been using your soap,” he says to Karen, in a gruff but approving tone, as we make our way inside.\nMeLea’s three boys, ages 2, 4, and 7, are a cyclone of energy, showing off their rock and feather collections, playing nonsense songs on a toy guitar, plucking daisies from the yard to present to us. The youngest appears in the doorway without pants on. MeLea, who wears a tank top that shows off her lanky frame and tattoos, seems unfazed.\nMeLea and Karen swap church gossip over glasses of lemonade. They first met through their congregation: When a mutual friend heard about Karen’s forays into the Facebook group, she encouraged Karen to reach out to MeLea, whose mother had died of lung cancer. Their surrogate process was fairly seamless. MeLea had known Karen’s youngest biological daughter and had prayed for them when the two became estranged.\nAt the kitchen table, the conversation turns to goats and soap. Karen talks wearily about the hundreds of bars she still has to make for upcoming farmers’ markets. MeLea asks how she came up with the company name, Rapha Farms. Karen tells her the word means “healing” in Hebrew—fitting for a soap that could soothe eczema with its lactic acid but also because she started the business for her youngest daughter, who survived childhood brain cancer.\nAs with any family tale, there’s always more to the story. At 8, Karen’s daughter underwent surgery and radiation. When she lost her hair from chemo, Karen shaved her head too. The family adopted Angel the dog to keep her daughter company. Her daughter suffered brain damage from the tumor removal, but the cancer went into remission. Then, at 12, she fell in love with a pair of goats and told her mom that she wanted to be a farmer. Karen was skeptical—goats? Really? They lived in the suburbs of Minnetonka then, but her daughter’s excitement won her over, so they built stalls in their garage for two goats. It was winter, and their hands cramped in the cold as mother and daughter slowly learned how to milk. They fell in love with it. By the next year, they had moved to the country and taken up goat farming full-time. Karen hoped she could teach her daughter how to run the business, imagining she might have limited career opportunities. Karen incorporated goat-tending into a homeschooling plan.\nFor years, Karen’s daughter made soap, helped with the goats, and manned farmers’ market tables. Then she turned 18 and got a boyfriend. She quit her job with Rapha Farms a few days after her 19th birthday and, not long after that, moved out of Karen’s house. She got married in 2023. Karen was not invited. “I honestly don’t understand what happened between us,” Karen wrote in a Rapha Farms Instagram post congratulating the couple. Karen calls this complicated family history her “soap opera.”\nThis year, Karen’s goats had a lot of kids—yes, that’s the technical term—and MeLea asks if she needed to wean them. No, Karen says, the mother goats do that themselves, kicking away their grown-up progeny when they try to nurse. The only exception was Lucy, one of the first two goats she got with her biological daughter, and the mascot for Rapha Farms. “She was the best mom ever,” Karen says. “The other moms would reject their kids, and Lucy would nurse her kids until they didn’t want to nurse anymore.”\nWhen we go to leave, MeLea’s boys groan and ask Karen for hugs. They wave dramatically as they hang from the play structure on the front lawn. I catch my forehead in the reflection of Karen’s rearview mirror—the bug bite has blown up to the exact size and shape of an egg. I’m amazed that the kids didn’t say anything about it. “They’re so sweet,” Karen says once we’re on the road. She seems filled up by the interaction.\nNot everyone sees this situation as Karen does. When MeLea first talked to Karen about becoming a surrogate grandparent, she wanted her sister, Tanya, to be involved too. (That’s not her real name; she spoke to me under the condition that I use a pseudonym.) Tanya was skeptical—and she wasn’t looking for a new mother. The sisters’ mom died only 40 days after being diagnosed with cancer; there had been so little time to process it. “I don’t view Karen as my mom, because my mom’s dead,” Tanya tells me at dinner one night. “MeLea brought it up to me, and I thought she was nuts.” She and her six kids have spent time with Karen, but Tanya feels put off by the situation. “An arranged marriage is how I view it,” she says.\nOf course, even among those who willingly join Surrogate Grandparents USA, there are hazards. One prospective grandma from Missouri told me about four failed surrogate families. She’d been ghosted, hit up for money, and dumped. Another surrogate grandma had a relationship with two girls that got complicated after their parents split. She didn’t agree with all of the parenting choices but didn’t feel like she could say anything. “As a surrogate grandparent, you have no history or relationship with the parents,” she said. “That’s a very unnatural grandparent relationship.” Out of a sense of duty, she continued picking the girls up from school once a week and hosting them for sleepovers at her house, feeling more like nanny than granny.\nThe Facebook group also hasn’t given its founder, Donna, all she’d hoped. When I asked about the founding date of Surrogate Grandparents USA, Donna knew it off the top of her head: The group is the same age as her grandson, whom she has never met. Her son and daughter-in-law cut off contact with Donna’s side of the family when he was born. “We were totally blacked out of their lives completely,” she told me over Zoom from her home in Florida, where she lives with her dog, cats, and husband. Donna gesticulated with her remarkably long nails when she spoke, a stark contrast to her short, white hair and wire-rimmed glasses. Now retired, her days are spent riding electric bikes around her senior living community, kayaking, and moderating Surrogate Grandparents USA. Still, she thinks about her grandson daily. “The pain and the grief is so tremendous,” she said. The Facebook group is a way to commemorate him, though every login is a reminder of her loss.\nDonna created another Facebook group, which is part open letter to her grandson, part chronicle of her experience as an estranged grandparent. She has written to her grandson about how he was a third cousin of Bob Dylan, sent him wishes for a happy Easter. She wrote letters about how his parents were keeping the family apart and attached an image of a $25 check written out to her son, which he had ripped up and returned. The content is incredibly personal, like encountering someone’s diary, but the group is public—how else would her grandson find it someday?\nDonna doesn’t necessarily want to find a surrogate adult child—she has a biological daughter with whom she’s close. What Donna wants is a substitute for the grandson she never met. First, Donna found a family nearby, but she ended things when the parents began asking her for gifts and trips (which has since become a stated no-no in the group’s rules). After that, Donna and her husband connected with a mother and daughter who lived on Long Island. The four met at an amusement park in Orlando and grabbed dinner. For a while after, they talked on the phone and checked in over FaceTime, but the distance became difficult. Donna told me she’d be open to connecting with another surrogate family but wasn’t, at the moment, actively looking.\nDonna often sees people come to the group too fresh from the pain of estrangement or loss. “Some people are going through an emotional time, so they want an overnight fix,” she said. “This is not an overnight fix.”\nTanya’s take is that it would never be a fix. She explains that her sister MeLea is trusting—and, perhaps, has a right to be, considering she knew Karen from real life—but Tanya has questions. She thinks Karen and Dave are “super kind,” she says, but is wary about the other side of the story. “I wish I could sit down with her daughters and be like, ‘What did you see? What did you hear? What was it that broke that relationship for you to the point where you felt like there was no repairing?’” (Karen’s daughters didn’t want to speak with me on the record.) And then there’s the question of what might happen if Karen’s daughters came back into her life. Karen still expresses frustration and sadness about her daughters and keeps up with their whereabouts through mutual friends. When Angel the dog died, Karen texted her youngest daughter the news—but used a new number and posed as a family friend. “With that reaction, I question if the door is really shut,” Tanya says. For her part, Karen considers Tanya part of the surrogate family and seems to be patiently waiting for her to come around.\nAfter dinner, Tanya and I drive separately to her house. I pull up cautiously because her kids—four boys and two girls—are flying down the slanted driveway on bikes and scooters. “Put a helmet on,” Tanya’s husband calls to them from his fold-out chair. All of the kids have pierced ears. “We’re raising the last generation of feral children,” Tanya jokes. We sit in the driveway; they give no invitation to go inside.\n“Why are you getting interviewed?” one of the boys asks his parents.\nI explain that I’m writing a story about how Karen had met lots of different families and—I hesitate. Will Tanya be upset if I used the g-word? Grandma.\nTanya jumps in: “Lexi is doing a piece on families that aren’t related biologically, don’t have the same bloodlines, but they create relationships and stay together long-term, just like if they were biological families.”\n“So what exactly would that mean?” one kid asks.\n“That she would be our grandma,” another kid says in response.\n“No,” Tanya says. “When I say ‘grandma,’ it means something to me. It means something in my heart, like how I feel about my mom. And so I don’t want to put those expectations on it—and, you know, that’s kind of where I want to leave it.”\nThe kids are not ready to leave it. “So by her terms, we would be grandkids?”\n“Maybe,” Tanya says, with some exasperation. “You should ask her.” To Tanya, a biological grandma, bonded by blood and stories, feels truer than whatever Karen can be to them. I wonder if her kids feel the same way. Possibly, they just want a grandma.\nKaren has just finished mixing goat-milk shampoo when Meghan—the fourth surrogate daughter—arrives at the farm with her husband and their 4-year-old son, Owen. Karen wears a shirt that reads “Promoted to Grandma.” Meghan’s light brown hair is pulled back in a tight ponytail. She closes her eyes and takes a deep whiff. “It smells so good in here,” she says.\nOwen, who wears jean shorts and a Minnesota Twins baseball jersey, sticks out his hand to me. It’s cute and earnest, like he’s a tiny businessman. “What’s your name?” he asks, gazing at me with enormous blue eyes. I respond, but he’s off to do something else before I can ask him anything in return. Owen has autism, so his parents have been teaching him appropriate ways to greet people. But, being a kid, his interest shifts quickly.\nAll of us move to Karen’s office upstairs. It’s crowded with supplies and—somehow—more bars of soap, but it has more space than the living room and decidedly fewer bugs than outside. Like Michelle’s sons, Owen also loves the soap. He lights up when Karen offers him samples and places each bar one by one into a paper bag.\nWhen Meghan and Karen met through the Facebook group in late 2023, Karen was in the midst of moving to her farm in Independence. She seemed overwhelmed by the process, so Meghan offered to help her and Dave prep their old home for sale. Meghan’s husband is a contractor and didn’t mind lending a hand too. Karen and Dave took them up on it and paid them for their time. Meghan and her husband even came over to the house while Karen and Dave were off on vacation and painted the whole basement.\nDespite the way she dove headlong into Karen’s life (and home), Meghan had been careful about selecting a surrogate grandparent online. She and her husband have battled substance abuse and were still adjusting to their sober lives. “Since we got clean and moved, we don’t hang out with anybody,” she says. “We’re very particular on who we let into our lives. They were pretty much the first outsiders we’ve hung out with.”\nWhen Meghan got pregnant with Owen, she was still using. “When I gave birth, we took him home to a homeless shelter because we had nowhere to go,” she says. Her biological mother didn’t offer help or a place to stay. It was the end of that relationship. “After going through what I’ve gone through, I know that estrangement can come in many, many forms,” she says, which is why she wasn’t worried when she learned about Karen’s biological daughters. She and Karen bonded over their interest in holistic health and natural living, which has been a focus for Meghan since getting sober. Because Karen’s ex-husband had autism, she also had some insights into Meghan’s experiences.\nMeghan and her husband got married at City Hall in the spring; Karen and Dave were their witnesses. Meghan insisted it be a quick, informal affair, but Karen still made her a bouquet with red and white roses. I imagined Karen by Meghan’s side—there for Meghan even though she hadn’t been invited to her own daughters’ weddings.\nBack in Karen’s office, 4-year-old Owen asks me an important question: “Do you have pepperoni?” I do not. But Karen does. Owen grabs her by the hand to lead her to the kitchen. He leads her out of the room at other times too, so she can show him where to get a power strip to plug into an electrical outlet (he loves outlets), or because he wants to check out her vacuum, or because he wants her to help him find Dave. He seems as comfortable with her as any grandchild would be with a grandparent.\nPretty soon, Karen, Meghan, Owen, and I head outside. Bugs be damned, I’m eager to meet the goats. Dave joins us as we feed them mushy bananas out of soap molds, then he takes me inside the goat pen. Owen follows us at first but gets overwhelmed when the goats surround him. I can’t blame him: The biggest goat, Buddy, weighs 230 pounds.\nDave tells me how, two years ago, Lucy—their goat mascot and “best mom ever”—got pneumonia. Parasites took advantage of her weakened immune system, and she died. Karen and Dave were devastated to lose one of their original goats. Then something strange happened. Lucy had been the herd’s queen. The other goats relied on her to know when it was time to feed, what path to take through the pasture, when they should go into heat for breeding. After she died, the goats stood out screaming in the field as night fell. No one had told them how to get home. Without their mother, they were lost. All this time later, a queen hasn’t stepped up to take Lucy’s place. As we talk, a doe rams into a boy goat that has a swath of my linen pant leg in its mouth. That doe seems to be coming into her own, I note. “Maybe she’ll be the new queen,” Dave says. Only time will tell if she has what it takes, and if the herd will accept her as their new mother.\nSeveral weeks after my trip to Minnesota, Karen calls to say that she’s in touch with her youngest daughter again. Her daughter’s brain cancer has returned. Karen’s voice shakes; patients with this diagnosis tend to live five years, maybe less. She wants to help her daughter through treatment, but her daughter has only agreed to communicate by phone.\nKaren’s surrogate children and grandchildren tried to be there for her. Michelle brought her coffee at the farmer’s market. MeLea and Tanya took her to the county fair with the kids. They felt Karen’s pain. But this raised old questions: Would they lose their new relationship if Karen’s “real” daughters reconnected?\nWhen Karen got the news of the diagnosis, she hired more workers for the farm so she could drop everything for her daughter. She waited for a call that never came; her daughter stopped responding. As months passed without her daughter asking for help, Karen was left with an open calendar. “I guess that will free up more time for the grandkids,” she tells me, forcing brightness into her tone.\nThat ends up being true for some of her surrogate families, but not for others. By the fall, Karen drifts apart from Meghan. Though Meghan seems to want a real connection, Karen tells me that her husband “drops lots of hints about wanting handouts, and that was getting old.” Meanwhile, MeLea and Tanya argue regularly—in the way sisters do, about the kind of family wounds that go back lifetimes. They go for stretches without speaking to each other. “They both have called me crying,” Karen says. “MeLea says her mom would’ve fixed it.” And Karen wants to; she’s trying.\nAt Thanksgiving, about a year after she first posted about herself in Surrogate Grandparents USA, Karen posts a different kind of photo, this one to the Rapha Farms feed. In it, she gathers around a banquet table with MeLea’s and Michelle’s families. The adults had met before, but this is the first time the kids have gotten together. Everyone is dressed comfortably in sweatshirts and jeans. MeLea’s youngest son splays half asleep in his father’s arms, Michelle’s eldest son smiles and poses with his arm around Karen. They look like a family.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

    "content_text": "The DeepSeek AI chatbot, released by a Chinese startup, has temporarily dethroned OpenAI’s ChatGPT from the top spot on Apple’s US App Store.\nThe app is completely free to use, and DeepSeek’s R1 model is powerful enough to be comparable to OpenAI’s o1 “reasoning” model, except DeepSeek’s chatbot is not sequestered behind a $20-a-month paywall like OpenAI’s is. Also, the DeepSeek model was efficiently trained using less powerful AI chips, making it a benchmark of innovative engineering.\nI’ve tested many new generative AI tools over the past couple of years, so I was curious to see how DeepSeek compares to the ChatGPT app already on my smartphone. After a few hours of using it, my initial impressions are that DeepSeek’s R1 model will be a major disruptor for US-based AI companies, but it still suffers from the weaknesses common to other generative AI tools, like rampant hallucinations, invasive moderation, and questionably scraped material.\nHow to Access the DeepSeek Chatbot\nUsers interested in trying out DeepSeek can access the R1 model through the Chinese startup’s smartphone apps (Android, Apple), as well as on the company’s desktop website. You can also use the model through third-party services like Perplexity Pro. In the app or on the website, click on the DeepThink (R1) button to use the best model. Developers who want to experiment with the API can check out that platform online. It’s also possible to download a DeepSeek model to run locally on your computer.\nIn order to use all the consumer features, you will need to create a user account that tracks your chats. “We store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People's Republic of China,” reads the company’s privacy policy. Check out this article from WIRED’s Security desk for a more detailed breakdown about what DeepSeek does with the data it collects. It’s worth keeping in mind that, just like ChatGPT and other American chatbots, you should always avoid sharing highly personal details or sensitive information during your interactions with a generative AI tool.\nIs This Basically FreeGPT?\nYes and no! If you’re looking for a free chatbot to use, ChatGPT already includes plenty of free features. So does Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and Meta’s AI tool. So, why is the fact that DeepSeek is free notable? It’s about the raw power of the model that’s generating these free-for-now answers. As previously mentioned, DeepSeek’s R1 mimics OpenAI’s latest o1 model, without the $20-a-month subscription fee for the basic version and $200-a-month for the most capable model. This comes as a major blow to OpenAI’s attempt to monetize ChatGPT through subscriptions.\nAnother feature that’s similar to ChatGPT is the option to send the chatbot out into the web to gather links that inform its answers. DeepSeek does not have deals with publishers to use their content in answers; OpenAI does , including with WIRED’s parent company, Condé Nast. But the web search outputs were decent, and the links gathered by the bot were generally helpful.\nStill, the current DeepSeek app does not have all the tools longtime ChatGPT users may be accustomed to, like the memory feature that recalls details from past conversations so you’re not always repeating yourself. DeepSeek also doesn’t have anything close to ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, which lets you have voice conversations with the chatbot, though the startup is working on more multimodal capabilities.\nA Research Breakthrough, but Still Inaccurate\nThough it may almost seem unfair to knock the DeepSeek chatbot for issues common across AI startups, it’s worth dwelling on how a breakthrough in model training efficiency does not even come close to solving the roadblock of hallucinations, where a chatbot just makes things up in its responses to prompts. Many of the outputs I generated included blatant falsehoods, confidently spewed out. For example, when I asked R1 what the model already knew about me without searching the web, the bot was convinced I’m a longtime tech reporter at The Verge. No shade, but not true!\nAs other reporters have demonstrated, the app often begins generating answers about topics that are censored in China, like the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, before deleting the output and encouraging you to ask about other topics, like math. With that in mind, I retried a few of the tests I used in 2023, after ChatGPT’s web browsing had just launched, and actually got helpful answers about culturally sensitive topics. I pretended to be a woman looking for a late-term abortion in Alabama, and DeepSeek provided useful advice about traveling out of state, even listing specific clinics worth researching and highlighting organizations that provide travel assistance funds.\nSure, DeepSeek has earned praise in Silicon Valley for making the model available locally with open weights—the ability for the user to adjust the model’s capabilities to better fit specific uses. Even so, the model remains just as opaque as all the other options when it comes to what data the startup used for training, and it’s clear a massive amount of data was needed to pull this off. Without the web search enabled, I was able to generate full snippets of classic WIRED articles. Does this mean the articles were ingested as part of the training process? It’s hard to be certain, and DeepSeek doesn’t have a communications team or a press representative yet, so we may not know for a while.\nDeclaring DeepSeek’s R1 release as a death blow to American AI leadership would be both premature and hyperbolic. While the success of DeepSeek does call into question the real need for high-powered chips and shiny new data centers, I wouldn’t be surprised if companies like OpenAI borrowed ideas from DeepSeek’s architecture to improve their own models. Rather than fully popping the AI bubble, this high-powered free model will likely transform how we think about AI tools—much like how ChatGPT’s original release defined the shape of the current AI industry.",

    "content_text": "Since January 7, wildfires have been burning their way through Los Angeles. The aftermath is devastating, with over 16,000 homes destroyed, drinking water contaminated, and more than two dozen people killed. As longtime residents attempt to rebuild, relief has come in all forms, from donations made to the American Red Cross to people giving to individual families’ GoFundMe efforts. Soon, those looking to help will have a new way to give: by buying a video game bundle.\nThe California Fire Relief Bundle is the work of indie studio Necrosoft Games and a collection of volunteers the company’s director, Brandon Sheffield, organized to compile the bundle. From January 12 through 19, they collected 422 games—including popular titles like Tunic, Octodad: Dadliest Catch, and Hoa—on independent game platform Itch.io. From those, Sheffield says, the collective aims to create the California Fire Relief Bundle, which it’ll sell for about $10 a pop, a good price for hundreds of titles. Proceeds from the bundle, which Sheffield aims to launch “ASAP,” will go to relief efforts aimed at helping Los Angeles-area residents get back on their feet financially.\n“I've seen many [people] get priced out because it can be an expensive place to live,” says Sheffield, a California native. “So when a fire like this reduces total housing, inspires landlords to do price hikes, and gets unhoused folks into even more vulnerable positions, it feels like those of us in stable living positions should do whatever we can.”\nLos Angeles holds a special place in the heart of the video game industry. It’s home to hundreds of developers and to studios such as Riot Games, Naughty Dog, and Santa Monica Studio. Before E3 shut down, downtown LA was the conference’s longtime home. It’s the location of The Game Awards and the venue for many smaller annual game events. It’s in part because of that association, Sheffield says, that developers from everywhere are stepping in to help.\nBut there’s another reason: climate change. A warming world is increasing the likelihood of wildfires in California. The same is true of hurricanes and other natural disasters. For video game developers, whose work has its own substantial carbon footprint, these environmental impacts are “a big deal for everyone,” Sheffield says.\n“This crisis has deeply affected our teams, with some Rioters losing their homes and many others still evacuated,” Riot wrote in a statement about the fires. The game company also announced its own in-game fundraisers to be held within Valorant and League of Legends. Other video game companies such as Activision and Sony are also donating to relief efforts.\nAccording to a recent report from the organizers of the Game Developers Conference, 16 percent of devs surveyed said they’d been impacted by natural disasters in the past year. Seventy-three percent of respondents to the “State of the Game Industry” report, for which organizers surveyed over 3,000 people, specified that they were impacted by water-related incidents, including hurricanes, floods, and storms. “Hurricane Milton did some damage at my home office, causing me lots of unexpected financial hardship,” wrote one developer in Florida. “I'm no longer able to pour money into my business as much as I did before.”\nOther developers in tropical regions pointed to intense flooding that kept them stranded, or worse. “Four people in our team were affected by the flood [in the] south of Brazil in May 2024,” a developer wrote. “One of our colleagues had to seek shelter and couldn’t work for three weeks.”\nSheffield’s own team was also hit hard, and not just by the LA fires. “This year alone, with my small team of eight, we've seen people having to shelter or evacuate from storms, tornados, hurricanes, and wildfires,” Sheffield says. “One of our artist's parents had to evacuate for this fire event specifically.”\nVideo games, like many organizations in the tech world, play a part in the ongoing climate crisis, from the electricity they use to the environmental issues that arise in their production. Developers are well aware of this. In the past few years, some have made games specifically to help raise awareness; major companies like Epic Games and Microsoft implemented energy-saving features into their games and platforms, respectively.\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence—an unpopular move already among many developers—is doing increasingly more damage as the use of AI balloons. AI also requires a huge amount of energy, which tech companies are currently scrambling to suck up. “Not only is AI contributing to climate change through emissions, they're driving up energy prices,” says Sheffield, whose LA fires fundraising bundle specifically rejected games that used generative AI. “A lot of game developers are complicit in this right now and should maybe give that a real thought.”",

    "content_text": "The United States’ recent regulatory action against the Chinese-owned social video platform TikTok prompted mass migration to another Chinese app, the social platform “Rednote.” Now, a generative artificial intelligence platform from the Chinese developer DeepSeek is exploding in popularity, posing a potential threat to US AI dominance and offering the latest evidence that moratoriums like the TikTok ban will not stop Americans from using Chinese-owned digital services.\nDeepSeek, an AI research lab created by a prominent Chinese hedge fund, recently gained popularity after releasing its latest open source generative AI model that easily competes with top US platforms like those developed by OpenAI. However, to help avoid US sanctions on hardware and software, DeepSeek created some clever workarounds when building its models. On Monday, DeepSeek’s creators limited new sign-ups after claiming the app had been overrun with a “large-scale malicious attack.”\nWhile DeepSeek has several AI models, some of which can be downloaded and run locally on your laptop, the majority of people will likely access the service through its iOS or Android apps or its web chat interface. Like with other generative AI models, you can ask it questions and get answers; it can search the web; or it can alternatively use a reasoning model to elaborate on answers.\nDeepSeek, which does not appear to have established a communications department or press contact yet, did not return a request for comment from WIRED about its user data protections and the extent to which it prioritizes data privacy initiatives.\nAs people clamor to test out the AI platform, though, the demand brings into focus how the Chinese startup collects user data and sends it home. Users have already reported several examples of DeepSeek censoring content that is critical of China or its policies. The AI setup appears to collect a lot of information—including all your chat messages—and send it back to China. In many ways, it’s likely sending more data back to China than TikTok has in recent years, since the social media company moved to US cloud hosting to try to deflect US security concerns\n“It shouldn’t take a panic over Chinese AI to remind people that most companies in the business set the terms for how they use your private data” says John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. “And that when you use their services, you’re doing work for them, not the other way around.”\nWhat DeepSeek Collects About You\nTo be clear, DeepSeek is sending your data to China. The English-language DeepSeek privacy policy, which lays out how the company handles user data, is unequivocal: “We store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.”\nIn other words, all the conversations and questions you send to DeepSeek, along with the answers that it generates, are being sent to China or can be. DeepSeek’s privacy policies also outline the information it collects about you, which falls into three sweeping categories: information that you share with DeepSeek, information that it automatically collects, and information that it can get from other sources.\nThe first of these areas includes “user input,” a broad category likely to cover your chats with DeepSeek via its app or website. “We may collect your text or audio input, prompt, uploaded files, feedback, chat history, or other content that you provide to our model and Services,” the privacy policy states. Within DeepSeek’s settings, it is possible to delete your chat history. On mobile, go to the left-hand navigation bar, tap your account name at the bottom of the menu to open settings, and then click “Delete all chats.”\nThis collection is similar to that of other generative AI platforms that take in user prompts to answer questions. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, has been criticized for its data collection although the company has increased the ways data can be deleted over time. Regardless of these types of protections, privacy advocates emphasize that you should not disclose any sensitive or personal information to AI chat bots.\n“I would not input personal or private data in any such an AI assistant,” says Lukasz Olejnik, independent researcher and consultant, affiliated with King's College London Institute for AI. Olejnik notes, though, that if you install models like DeepSeek’s locally and run them on your computer, you can interact with them privately without your data going to the company that made them. Additionally, AI search company Perplexity says it has added DeepSeek to its platforms but claims it is hosting the model in US and EU data centers.\nOther personal information that goes to DeepSeek includes data that you use to set up your account, including your email address, phone number, date of birth, username, and more. Likewise, if you get in touch with the company, you’ll be sharing information with it.\nBart Willemsen, a VP analyst focusing on international privacy at Gartner, says that, generally, the construction and operations of generative AI models is not transparent to consumers and other groups. People don’t know exactly how they work or the exact data they have been built upon. For individuals, DeepSeek is largely free, although it has costs for developers using its APIs. “So what do we pay with? What do we usually pay with: data, knowledge, content, information,” Willemsen says.\nAs with all digital platforms—from websites to apps—there can also be a large amount of data that is collected automatically and silently when you use the services. DeepSeek says it will collect information about what device you are using, your operating system, IP address, and information such as crash reports. It can also record your “keystroke patterns or rhythms,” a type of data more widely collected in software built for character-based languages. Additionally, if you purchase DeepSeek’s premium services, the platform will collect that information. It also uses cookies and other tracking technology to “measure and analyze how you use our services.”\nA WIRED review of the DeepSeek website's underlying activity shows the company also appears to send data to Baidu Tongji, Chinese tech giant Baidu's popular web analytics tool, as well as Volces, a Chinese cloud infrastructure firm. In a social media post, Sean O'Brien, founder of Yale Law School's Privacy Lab, said that DeepSeek is also sending “basic” network data and “device profile” to TikTok owner ByteDance “and its intermediaries.\nThe final category of information DeepSeek reserves the right to collect is data from other sources. If you create a DeepSeek account using Google or Apple sign-on, for instance, it will receive some information from those companies. Advertisers also share information with DeepSeek, its policies say, and this can include “mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which we use to help match you and your actions outside of the service.”\nHow DeepSeek Uses Information\nHuge volumes of data may flow to China from DeepSeek’s international user base, but the company still has power over how it uses the information. DeepSeek’s privacy policy says the company will use data in many typical ways, including keeping its service running, enforcing its terms and conditions, and making improvements.\nCrucially, though, the company’s privacy policy suggests that it may harness user prompts in developing new models. The company will “review, improve, and develop the service, including by monitoring interactions and usage across your devices, analyzing how people are using it, and by training and improving our technology,” its policies say.\nDeepSeek’s privacy policy also says the company will also use information to “comply with [its] legal obligations”—a blanket clause many companies include in their policies. DeepSeek’s privacy policy says data can be accessed by its “corporate group,” and it will share information with law enforcement agencies, public authorities, and more when it is required to do so.\nWhile all companies have legal obligations, those based in China do have notable responsibilities. Over the past decade, Chinese officials have passed a series of cybersecurity and privacy laws meant to allow state officials to demand data from tech companies. One 2017 law, for instance, says that organizations and citizens should “cooperate with national intelligence efforts.”\nThese laws, alongside growing trade tensions between the US and China and other geopolitical factors, fueled security fears about TikTok. The app could harvest huge amounts of data and send it back to China, those in favor of the TikTok ban argued, and the app could also be used to push Chinese propaganda. (TikTok has denied sending US user data to China’s government.) Meanwhile, several DeepSeek users have already pointed out that the platform does not provide answers for questions about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and it answers some questions in ways that sound like propaganda.\nWillemsen says that, compared to users on a social media platform like TikTok, people messaging with a generative AI system are more actively engaged and the content can feel more personal. In short, any influence could be larger. “Risks of subliminal content alteration, conversation direction steering, in active engagement ought by that logic to lead to more concern, not less,” he says, “especially given how the inner workings of the model are widely unknown, its thresholds, borders, controls, censorship rules, and intent/personae largely left unscrutinized, and it being already so popular in its infancy stage.”\nOlejnik, of King's College London, says that while the TikTok ban was a specific situation, US law makers or those in other countries could act again on a similar premise. “We can’t rule out that 2025 will bring an expansion: direct action against AI firms,” Olejnik says. “Of course, data collection may again be named as the reason.”\nUpdated 5:27 pm EST, January 27, 2025: Added additional details about the DeepSeek website's activity.\nUpdated 10:05 am EST, January 29, 2025: Added additional details about DeepSeek's network activity.",

The suite of artificial intelligence features—introduced late in 2024 in iOS 18.1—has received mixed reactions. Some capabilities, like automatically transcribing voice notes and recordings, creating custom emojis, and proofreading, are handy. Others not so much. Apple came under fire for inaccurate notification summaries, particularly those from news apps, and it has temporarily disabled the feature for news and entertainment apps in iOS 18.3.\nWhen Apple first launched its AI venture, you had to opt in. But now, with iOS 18.3, which just released today, Apple Intelligence is enabled automatically during the onboarding process for new users, and anyone upgrading to iOS 18.3. You can still opt out by following a few steps. Whether you want to enable just certain features or disable the whole thing, here's how to turn off Apple Intelligence.\nFor more on Apple Intelligence (and other features), check out our iOS 18 roundup and macOS Sequoia roundup. Also, check out our other Apple guides, including the Best iPhones, Best iPads, and Best MacBooks.\nWhat's Powered by Apple Intelligence?\nFor a breakdown of Apple Intelligence and how each feature works, read our aforementioned roundup of iOS 18 features and macOS 15 features. Below is a list of all the capabilities you'll have access to when it's enabled:\n- Writing Tools\n- ChatGPT Extension via Siri\n- Genmoji\n- Image Playground\n- Image Wand\n- Priority Notifications\n- Summaries in Mail and Messages\n- Notification Summaries\n- Reduce Interruptions Focus\nRemember, Apple Intelligence is only available on select devices. For example, even if older iPhones can download iOS 18, only handsets like the iPhone 15 Pro and the entire iPhone 16 range support Apple's AI capabilities.\nHow to Disable Apple Intelligence\nDisabling Apple Intelligence is the same process whether you're using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac:\n- Open Settings on your device\n- Scroll down until you find Apple Intelligence & Siri and tap on it\n- Toggle Apple Intelligence off\nHow to Disable Specific Features\nYou don't have to turn off Apple Intelligence completely. You can disable the ChatGPT integration or even turn it off within apps, preventing Siri from making suggestions across all your apps.\n- Go to Settings > Apple Intelligence\n- Scroll down to Apps\n- Select the app you want to disable Apple Intelligence from, tap on it, and toggle off “Learn from this App”\nIn the Mail app, you can also turn off the email summarization feature (which is part of Apple Intelligence). That way, it will no longer summarize previews of your emails as you scroll through your inbox.\n- Go to Settings > Apps\n- Tap the Mail app\n- Scroll down to Message List\n- Toggle off Summarize Message Preview\nApple has made it easier to distinguish AI-summarized notifications. They'll now appear in italics, and you can press and hold the notification and tap Options to turn them off more quickly without diving into a settings menu.\nYou can also turn off the ChatGPT extension, which will keep Siri and other features from using OpenAI's chatbot to help answer questions.\n- Go to Settings > Apple Intelligence\n- Scroll down to ChatGPT and select it\n- Toggle Use ChatGPT off\nTurn Apple Intelligence Back On\nIf you change your mind, you can always turn Apple Intelligence back on. Follow the same steps you took to turn it off.\n- Open Settings\n- Scroll down and select Apple Intelligence & Siri\n- Toggle Apple Intelligence & Siri on\nThis enables the feature immediately, though you may have to give your device some time for all the features to load. You can see the loading progress on your screen in real time.",

    "content_text": "For at least 100 years, automakers have stuck to a tried and trusted playbook: They’ll kick, scream, and obfuscate before they’re forced by law to fit profit-draining, life-saving technology. From their successful rejection of speed governor proposals in the 1920s, to their shaming by lawyer Ralph Nader’s Unsafe at Any Speed published in 1965, which inspired the creation of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the US, auto companies—Volvo excepted—have rarely incorporated safety features willingly.\nTrue to form, a lawsuit filed January 17 by the auto industry’s leading lobbying group seeks to repeal a safety rule that would make automated emergency braking standard equipment in all cars—something that NHTSA estimates will save at least 362 lives every year, but which road safety groups expect will save many more, perhaps even tens of thousands more.\nThe auto industry claims the rule will be almost impossible to implement. Road safety experts say this is patently false, and accuse car companies of balking at the cost of fitting upgraded braking kit as standard, despite the lifesaving potential.\nAccording to an OECD report released on the last day of December, Americans are far more likely to die in car crashes than those living in other rich countries. The per capita crash death rate is three times higher in the US than Ireland, Norway, UK, Germany, or Japan. Only those living in Costa Rica and Colombia fare worse.\nThe new US rule isn’t a diktat from a nannying European Union; it’s a homegrown one and, unusually, is even tougher to meet than a similar EU law in force across Europe since 2022. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 127—FMVSS 127 for short, introduced last July—gives automakers four years to fit all cars and light trucks with advanced, always-on automatic emergency braking (AEB) technology that, in a “crash imminent situation,” states the regulation, will “automatically apply the vehicle brakes if the driver has not done so.”\nLow-speed AEB—marketed as Eyesight by Subaru and Pre-Collision Assist with Automatic Emergency Braking by Ford—has been around since the mid-1990s, but FMVSS 127 stipulates that the technology should work at higher speeds, and in darkness, and should not be an optional add-on but fitted as standard.\nNHTSA began testing AEB systems as part of the government’s five-star safety rating program known as the New Car Assessment Program, or NCAP, in 2010, and soon thereafter listed them as “recommended advanced technology” but did not mandate their fitting.\nNow, the systems “have reached a level of maturity to make a significant contribution to reducing the frequency and severity of crashes and are thus ready to be mandated,” says a NHTSA notice on the Federal Register.\nMandating advanced AEB systems would “address a clear and growing safety problem,” states NHTSA, asserting that “to wait for market-driven adoption … would lead to deaths and injuries that could be avoided if the technology were required.”\nNHTSA estimates that equipping new cars and trucks with advanced AEB will cost the auto industry $354 million. Automakers say it will be more than that, and they make no secret that one of their core objections to FMVSS 127 is that it will cut into their profits.\nThe Washington, DC–based Alliance for Automotive Innovation told NHTSA that the “proposed phase-in schedule may require redesigns outside of the normal product development cycle” and that this “would significantly increase costs.”\nThe Biden administration stipulation—mostly achievable with software tweaks, not hardware upgrades—was labeled as “flawed” by the Alliance, which filed suit in the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. In addition to the lawsuit, the trade association and lobby group—which represents Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Toyota, and others—also wrote to President Trump urging him to “re-open the AEB rule.”\nSafety groups are hoping Trump will ignore the Alliance’s pleas. FMVSS 127 is the “most impactful regulation for roadway safety issued in years,” says Cathy Chase, president of DC-based Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. On a video call she tells WIRED: “The auto industry does not like regulation. From airbags to electronic stability control, to pretty much every safety regulation that you can think of, the auto industry in one way or another did not want it.”\n“We lose 42,800 people a year to traffic violence [in the US],” says Peter Norton, associate professor of history in the Department of Engineering and Society at the University of Virginia. “This is due in part to our habit of asking [automotive companies] for [their] permission in matters of public safety.”\n“We didn’t ask theater owners for permission to require fire exits,” he says. “Government ordered theatre owners to install fire exits; horrific death tolls fell. If a theater owner said ‘Installing a fire exit is too expensive,’ government replied ‘Then we’ll make failure to install a fire exit even more expensive for you.’”\n“This principle applies with equal validity to automobile brakes,” says Norton. “We can ask industry how we can make implementation less burdensome, but we must not ask them whether the regulation is necessary—industry’s private interests and our public interests are different.”\nUnder FMVSS 127, cars and light trucks will be required to be able to “stop and avoid contact” with other motor vehicles at speeds of up to 62 mph. AEB systems must also apply the brakes automatically “up to 90 mph when a collision with a lead vehicle is imminent, and up to 45 mph when a pedestrian is detected.” Vehicle sensors must also detect pedestrians in both daylight and darkness.\nIn a letter to Congress in June last year, Alliance president and CEO John Bozzella claimed that meeting FMVSS 127 would be “practically impossible with available technology.”\nHowever, a close read of several brands' owner manuals suggests otherwise. The 2022 Toyota Prius Prime manual states that its system’s maximum AEB activation speed is 112 mph; ditto for the 2022 Lexus NX 250. The 2023 Hyundai Palisade owner’s manual lists the maximum AEB activation speed as 124.27 mph. Similarly, owner’s manuals from Volvo, Tesla, and other companies show that high-speed AEB activation has been on the market for years.\n“[FMVSS 127’s] requirements are achievable,” Joe Young, the media director of the insurance-industry-backed Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tells WIRED, “especially given the lengthy time frame that NHSTA has given the automakers.”\nThe AAA’s director of automotive research, Greg Brannon, agrees, stating that the new standard is “very challenging … but it is possible.”\n“We’ve been testing automatic emergency braking systems for well over a decade, and FMVSS 127 is definitely a jump, but the important thing to note about many of the higher-speed scenarios is that the standard only requires fully automatic emergency braking up to 50 miles an hour,” says Brannon. Speeds higher than this will include dynamic brake support, which sees the driver initiating the braking sequence. “The AEB system at those higher speeds doesn’t have to guess whether or not it should be braking,” he says.\nThe most challenging part of FMVSS 127 is the night-time Pedestrian Automatic Emergency Braking (PAEB) test, which, unlike the EU’s new AEB regulation, needs to work in complete darkness. More than 70 percent of pedestrians hit and killed by motorists are struck at night, according to NHTSA.\nProtecting pedestrians at night is “likely to require further advancements and developments in sensor technologies,” states Nadine Wong, director of track testing at independent testing company Dynamic Research. Working from a test track 15 miles north of Bakersfield, California, Dynamic Research already conducts FMVSS 127 testing for clients. “We know that there are vehicles currently available that already come close to achieving the standard,” said Wong.\nNHTSA acknowledges that FMVSS 127 is “technology-forcing,” but emphasizes that the “standard is practicable.”\nWhile the industry would be on the hook for $354 million in mostly software development costs, US society would benefit to the tune of up to $7.26 billion, says NHSTA, citing reductions in costs for the “negative externalities” of serious car crashes such as emergency service call-outs, medical care, insurance administrative costs, workplace costs, and legal costs.\n“Considering that automaking is America’s largest manufacturing sector, employs 10 million Americans, generates 5 percent of the US GDP, and drives $1 trillion into the economy annually,” says Chase, “it is remarkable that [the auto industry] would be unable to meet the requirements in the AEB rule by September 2029.”\nIn a press statement, William Wallace, Consumer Report’s director of safety advocacy, agreed: “It is profoundly disappointing that automakers are suing to block this lifesaving automatic emergency braking rule.”\nShaun Kildare, research director at the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, concurs. “When they say, ‘It's impracticable, we can never meet this standard,’ it’s false because some auto companies are already selling vehicles in the US that do it,” he says, “and they're definitely selling vehicles abroad that do it. [Auto companies] just don’t want to pay for it on every vehicle.”\nStill, the Alliance’s Bozzella has called FMVSS 127 a “disastrous” rule that “will endlessly—and unnecessarily—frustrate drivers [and] make vehicles more expensive.” Somewhat strangely, Bozzella also claims that the more stringent standard, tougher even than the equivalent one in EU, “won’t really improve driver or pedestrian safety.”\nHowever, the Alliance’s lawsuit ought to fail, says Chase. “NHTSA is risk averse. They like everything buttoned up. They would not have put out this rule if they thought it could be easily challenged.”\nLate last year, NHTSA released a set of studies showing that more than 860,000 lives have been saved by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards since 1968. Frontal air bags alone have saved more than 50,000 lives over a 30-year period, estimates NHTSA.\nPresident Trump nominated Sean Duffy to be the secretary of transportation, and he was duly confirmed on January 22. Duffy had told members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation that road safety was “close to home” for him, explaining that his wife survived a head-on car crash. He vowed to prioritize road safety, including for pedestrians and bicyclists.\nTrump also nominated Steven Bradbury to be deputy secretary of transportation. Bradbury is a fellow at right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, which wrote Project 2025, a 900-plus-page blueprint for government. Trump disavowed this plan during the election, but an analysis by Time.com has found that nearly two-thirds of the executive actions Trump has issued so far mirror or partially mirror proposals from Project 2025, including sweeping deregulation.\nProject 2025’s transportation plans include reducing fuel economy standards and removing highway spending from pedestrian and bicycling projects. Project 2025 was also in favor of smaller government and fewer regulations, an ask likely to be supercharged by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\nOn January 24, NHTSA said it would delay the effective date of FMVSS 127 to March 20 to give the new Trump administration time to further review the regulation.\nIt’s unknown whether Trump—or DOGE—will eventually kill FMVSS 127, but, says Norton, author also of a book on autonomous driving, “if we can’t get automakers to accept vehicle automation for safety, then we can’t expect them to be serious about fully robotic cars.”",

    "content_text": "When online romance and sextortion scammers sense they’ve found a victim who may send them money, they’ll use all kinds of villainous methods to get paid. They’ll frequently stoop to blackmail—and are constantly creating more devious approaches to incorporate it into their grifts. In recent months, cybercriminals have taken their blackmailing efforts up a notch, creating realistic-looking “news” videos that claim their victims are wanted for crimes.\nScammers based in West Africa, likely in Nigeria, and going under the broad umbrella of the Yahoo Boys, have increasingly been seen sending blackmail victims videos likely using AI-generated news anchors in a bid to pressure victims into paying up. A WIRED review of posts on Telegram by self-styled Yahoo Boys shows the cybercriminals are impersonating television stations based in the US and sharing tutorials about how to create the blackmailing videos.\nThe videos follow a sinister pattern. One video—which can be seen in the image below—uses CNN’s logo and branding to impersonate the news organization, with text at the bottom of the screen describing the “breaking news.” On the screen, a likely AI-generated newsreader starts talking.\n“Good day. My name is Kristina Lawson, reporting from New Jersey,” the anchor says in the nearly minute-long clip. “Just in: We have received a credible report regarding a disturbing incident.” The fake presenter says that a “young lady” has come forward to allege that they were sexually assaulted by an older man. In the video, the man, who is the target of the scam, is named, and a photograph of him appears onscreen.\nOther videos seen by WIRED feature different news readers and names of news channels, but they also show more graphic photos of the potential blackmail targets, including nude and explicit images. In one “news” clip, the screen is split in two, with a photo of a man’s face on one side and the other side is a short video clip of him allegedly masturbating.\nDavid Maimon, the head of fraud insights at SentiLink and a professor at Georgia State University who first spotted the CNN video in December, says the fraudsters have made a number of “disturbing” changes to their blackmailing tactics in recent months, including trying to humiliate people and potentially targeting those outside of English-speaking countries.\nTypically, Yahoo Boy scammers message hundreds of people online while posing as members of the opposite sex using pictures stolen from social media profiles. They run all types of scams, but for those that involve blackmail, they often attempt to build up a relationship with their potential victim and obtain compromising information—most commonly, nude images. Then they shift gears.\n“At some point, they reveal their identity after they get everything that they need, and then they start blackmailing,” Maimon says. They demand money and threaten to release images online or send them to family and friends if they’re not paid. “One of the approaches they use in order to make sure that the blackmail is realistic is actually producing those news clips that they send to the victims and in a way push them, nudge them, to pay the blackmail,” he says. “They try to push you to make decisions under conditions of stress, under conditions of urgency.”\nYahoo Boy fraudsters widely use social media platform Telegram as a way of organizing, chatting with each other, and as a marketplace where they sell knowledge and tutorials about how to operate different types of scams. The “news” videos seen by WIRED appear to include the details and images of real-world victims, although it was not possible to immediately verify the cases.\nBrian Mason, a constable with the Edmonton Police Service in Canada who investigates fraud and works with the victims of scams, says he has seen cases where videos or screenshots of fake CNN broadcasts have been sent to victims. “It looks like your typical CNN broadcast,” Mason says. “It's very, very convincing.” Mason says the approach has been utilized in sextortion scams, which commonly target teenagers and have been linked to a series of suicides.\nMason says he has seen incidents where the news clips falsely accuse scam victims of talking with underage females and that police are searching for them or have issued warrants for their arrest. “It makes the victim panic, because now they’re seeing themselves on this broadcast, and it’s a screen capture from when they were actually talking with the scammer from their own webcam,” Mason adds. The effect can potentially push the person into sending money or following demands from the scammers.\nTelegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn tells WIRED that activities observed in the scammer channels are a violation of the app's rules and suggested the company would take action against such channels.\n“Content encouraging scamming is explicitly forbidden by Telegram's terms of service,” Vaughn says. “Moderators empowered with custom AI and machine learning tools proactively monitor public parts of the platform and accept reports from users and organizations in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.”\nLast year, Telegram removed more than a dozen Yahoo Boy channels after WIRED reported on their public activity; however, the scammers still have a presence on the platform and other social media platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube.\nMessages shared within Telegram channels show how the fraudsters are quick to evolve their cons, use new technologies, and widely share or sell advice with each other. For instance, when people moved to Chinese alternative Rednote ahead of the proposed TikTok ban in the US earlier this month, Yahoo Boys recommended targeting people who had joined the app.\nWithin one Telegram channel, which has 10,000 subscribers, a scammer explained the steps needed to create false news videos and mocked-up front pages of newspapers over a series of messages. “In blackmailing (BM) work we get two different types which are: TV news [and] newspapers,” the first message says.\nIn subsequent messages, they gave examples of text that can be inserted into the script for the news bulletin, which says the alleged victim has been “accused of distributing nude images and videos without consent.” All a scammer following the tutorial needs to do is substitute the name and town of their victim and add any pictures they have.\nThe tutorial suggests headlines for news articles, such as “Local Man Accused of Online Blackmail and Harassment.” It also lists the names of US TV news networks, cable news, and “specialized news”—it listed 17 news outlets ranging from ABC News and Fox News to C-Span and Al Jazeera America. One other cybercriminal shared a video of a folder of blackmail scripts and tutorials needed to create fake news items.\nIn some fabricated news videos, the news anchor appears to be an AI-generated avatar, although it was not possible to determine which software was being used to create the clips. Tutorials shared on Telegram, however, also show that the grifters are not always using sophisticated technology. Some apps they point to are simple “meme generators.”\nLast year, WIRED reported on how Yahoo Boys are adopting deepfake face-swapping technology to make video calls with their targets and try to “prove” their false identities are real. However, Maimon also points to one troubling video shared by Yahoo Boy scammers that appears to show a potential victim making a video to apologize for questioning the scammer’s fake identity.\nWithin the video, the woman says, “I am truly sorry that I called you a fake” and asks the scammer to accept their apology. The individual says they hope they get to meet the person they believe they are in love with in the future, before they start removing their clothes to “make up” for the earlier accusation. “I think that what followed that video was them blackmailing her,” Maimon explains, “and of course posting it on the markets they’re on.”\nUpdated 10:45 am EST, January 28, 2025: Added comment from a Telegram spokesperson.",

    "content_text": "So, here’s a nightmare scenario: You open your work Slack on your phone so you can DM with a few colleagues. You talk with this group regularly, but you don’t see the chat in the list of active DMs on your phone, so you select all of the participants individually to pick the conversation back up. Without thinking too much of it, you accept an odd prompt that asks, “Do you want to include the entire chat history?”\nBecause yes, you think, of course it should include the chat history of the group DM you’ve been chatting in for ages. Who has time for this? There is business to conduct! Essential facts to convey! But the answer here is no, you do not want to do that. Because if you do, you will have ported your entire DM history with the first person you selected for the chat into the group DM.\nThis is not a hypothetical. In fact, this screw-up recently happened to me when I tried to DM two of my bosses, Brian Barrett and Tim Marchman. Suddenly, Tim had full access to years of private conversations between me and Brian, with no apparent way to undo it. “lmao andrew,” Brian wrote, “what have you done.”\nDead. I was, at that moment, obliterated by embarrassment—and worry that I’d just made a catastrophic mistake. I couldn’t even explain what had happened, let alone explain it away.\nOnce I realized I wasn’t going to be escorted into HR, and my heart rate dropped back to normal, I was determined to figure out what went wrong and warn the world not to make the same mistake I made.\nTurns out, this is definitely not a Slack feature—it’s a glitch.\n“This sounds like a mobile app sync issue,” says Slack spokesperson Vince Bitong over email. “Sometimes when switching between desktop and mobile Slack, recent conversations (including group DMs) don't immediately appear in your mobile DM list until the app syncs.”\nBecause my group DM with Brian and Tim didn’t appear in my list of conversations, Bitong adds, “the app treated this as creating a new group conversation. That's why you got the chat history prompt—it was asking if you wanted to include your private chat history with the first colleague into this new group.”\nMy next question, of course, was how Slack users can make sure this never happens—and what to do if it does. “You can go about this in a few ways,” Bitong says. “First, manually pull down to refresh the app. If that doesn't work, fully close and reopen the app.” That should result in your DM list being up to date, which obviates the problem.\nAlso, as mentioned, if you see the “Do you want to include the entire chat history?” prompt for a group DM you know already exists, remember to click “no.” (And even for a new group DM, think very carefully about what might be lurking in that history before you share.)\nAnd if you already messed up like I did and are looking for a way to triage the damage? “One solution is to convert the DM to a private channel, which gives you more control over the conversation history and member access,” Bitong says. You can do this by clicking on the names of the group DM members, click the Settings tab, select the “Change to a private channel” option, then remove whoever it is that shouldn’t be reading the chat history you just accidentally shared.\nThinking back, I still feel pings of shame from this experience—and not a small amount of relief that I did not get fired for what I assumed at the time was a terrible Slack feature combined with me being a huge dumbass. Fortunately, Brian and I are boring DMers—no trash-talking Tim (who is lovely!), or anyone else for that matter.\nYou can easily imagine, though, all the many terrible things that could have been exposed. Petty complaints about Tim’s management style, personality, or personal hygiene. Plans to undermine his projects. Personal information that you might be comfortable sharing with one colleague but not a larger group. Name calling, workplace gossip, nasty nicknames—the list of bad outcomes is virtually infinite.\nIn fact, that’s the most important lesson from this stupid ordeal: The safest way to ensure your life isn’t ruined by ill-advised things you say on Slack is to not say them at all.",

    "content_text": "You might have thought sticks had gone away. Oh boy, no. The game of Kubb? Throwing sticks. Conducting? Waving a stick around. Harry Potter merch. Fetch. Drumming. There’s even a stick appreciation movement, via Stick Nation’s “reviews” of cool finds in nature by “Stick Heads” that are posted on Instagram and TikTok. It makes you think.\nWhich brings us to the Veark Tool One. You already know what it is. But twist: There are three of them, they’re $68 (£55) for the set (yes), and they’re designed to be used as cooking utensils.\nTool One is the brainchild of Copenhagen-based designer and artist Kim Richardt. Around four years ago, deep in the pandemic era, Richardt says he simply got fed up with his spoons. “I was a little irritated, my spoons didn’t quite work with the casseroles I was cooking, so I thought maybe I could do something else,” he says.\n“It was straight to this. I went out to the wood store, bought three pieces of wood around 30 centimeters, went to my workshop, and I just made a set of these for myself. First take. It felt right. It was so intuitive to work with.”\nThe Tool One is indeed a pimped stick—handmade from beechwood, the three cooking sticks are 1 centimeter, 1.6 cm, and 2.2 cm wide, with tilted sides on the lower half, rounded to grip at the top.\n“The big one is actually fantastic to make an overnight sourdough,” Richardt says, “because when you use a wooden spoon to stir the sourdough, it’s very heavy and you get tired in your arm before you get the gluten effect.”\nIn his culinary experiments, he has used his new tools for everything from stirring cocktails to flipping fried fish in a pan: “It’s a tool that you just take out and maybe find your own needs for, actually. It’s not that dictated.” So universal functionality abounds! There is no specialist stick here, folks.\nAlongside making steel, brass, and wooden sculptures, Richardt has created minimalist designs for more than a decade for Danish design studio Frama: A day bed, a lounge chair, candle holders, a shelving system, a “very minimalist” lamp for the restaurant Noma.\nFrama passed on Tool One, though, so Richardt kept it at home until he stumbled on kitchenware studio Veark, also in Copenhagen, which makes tools inspired by professional kitchens. For cofounders Daniel Ronge and Christian Lorentzen, it was love at first stick.\nWe jest about the sheer simplicity of this thing, but Richardt’s inspiration came, of course, partly from utensils in Asia. Cooking chopsticks, often made from bamboo, have long been used by professional stir-fry chefs for tasting and sampling in the kitchen.\n“I had some chopsticks at home that I used to stir my oatmeal in the morning for a couple of years, and it was a little too small for doing that,” he says. “Then I thought I could make it larger into a design that could also flip a pancake. In Japan they actually have some rather big chopsticks, but they still use them in pairs when they stir, and they’re quite fun to handle.”\nAnd there is more practicality. Wooden utensils can last for decades versus years for silicon alternatives (if properly cleaned and stored), and there has been a lot of discussion of late over how many toxic chemicals regular black plastic spatulas might expose users to.\nIn design terms, it’s clear we’ve been heading in this direction for a while, primed to crave more and more of less and less. Minimalist Joseph Joseph kitchen tools and stacking bowls we’ve been strangely drawn to for some time, while Jony Ive has done for computers what his predecessors in industrial design did for, say, iconic chairs and lamps.\nAbstract wooden Scandi baby toys in beige, cream, and cool grays, though, can be quite infuriating. They should be bright red and bright green and make lots of noise. And blocky, featureless nativity sets we cannot abide. Ludicrous. They are simply taking the piss. But I think we can safely say that you cannot get more minimalist than a stick.\nAs WIRED senior editor Jeremy White exclaims, “How can something so ridiculous be so desirable?” Is a stirring stick inherently more macho than a spoon, perhaps? More like something The Bear’s Carmy Berzatto might throw across a kitchen?\n“It’s a humble tool. I was surprised at the simple thing of having a stick stirring your food,” says Richardt with a little laugh. “It took me back to something … I couldn’t explain it, but it was a nice feeling. I kind of felt that I was taken back to the Neanderthals.”",

You also may have a lot more to worry about beyond just the cost of replacing the phone. What if they saw me enter the passcode and now have easy access to all of my messages, photos, and sensitive information? While it definitely sucks to have your smartphone nabbed, turning on Apple’s Stolen Device protection can immediately cut thieves’ access to your smartphone data. This feature is not automatically enabled and needs to be activated before the crime occurs.\nFirst released as part of iOS 17.3, Stolen Device Protection essentially adds an extra layer of security to your smartphone whenever the device is somewhere you don’t regularly visit. Here’s a quick guide to what the software feature does and what steps are necessary to turn it on.\nFor a deeper dive into Apple’s anti-theft software, check out WIRED security reporter Matt Burgess’s article about the feature from last year. If you have an Android phone, read my guide to using Android's theft detection features.\nWhat Does Stolen Device Protection Do?\nThe feature is specifically designed for situations where a criminal not only takes your iPhone but also knows your passcode and can unlock the device. When they physically take your phone away from you and bring it to a location you don’t frequently visit, then the Stolen Device Protection security measures begin to kick in.\nThe main thing the feature triggers is it starts requiring your Face ID biometrics to access any sensitive features on the phone, like using your Keychain passwords, seeing your stored payment information in Safari, and disabling Lost Mode. Even if the thieves know your passcode, it will no longer work as a backup option; Face ID becomes required for full access. This also prevents thieves from easily wiping all your data off the phone so they can sell it, as that procedure requires FaceID as well.\nIn addition to forcing biometric authentication, Stolen Device Protection adds a security delay period for changes to safety features on the phone. If the thief wants to sign out of your Apple ID or turn off Find My iPhone, for example, they can’t just hold up the phone in front of your face for a few seconds as they flee the scene of the crime. With the feature’s automatic security delay, you have to wait an hour to make major safety changes to the device, and you have to confirm your biometrics at the beginning as well as at the end of this process.\nHow Do I Turn It On?\nBefore you’re able to turn on Stolen Device Protection, you first need to set up a few other basic features on your smartphone. You probably already have Face ID and a passcode enabled on your Apple device—both of these are necessary for the feature to work.\nNext, you’ll need to check whether two-factor authentication is enabled for your Apple ID, which is a good idea even if you aren’t using Stolen Device Protection. Check to see if you’re already using this by going to Settings, tapping on your name at the top, and then choosing the Sign-In & Security tab. You should see whether 2FA for your Apple ID is on or off in the middle of this screen.\nThe last software feature you need to activate on the iPhone is Significant Locations. This keeps track of places you regularly visit, so your phone can detect whether it’s in a familiar or unfamiliar place. According to Apple, the data is end-to-end encrypted and is not read by the company. Significant Locations is a bit buried in the menus—find it by opening Settings, then Privacy & Security, and Location Services. After that, scroll all the way down until you see the System Services tab. Select Significant Locations, and you’ll likely be prompted to unlock it with Face ID. On the next page, move the toggle to the right to finish enabling the feature.\nPhew! OK, now you’re ready to start using Stolen Device Protection. And, lucky for you, after all of that prep work, the last step is a breeze. Open Settings one more time, then Face ID & Passcode, and fill out your passcode. Scroll about halfway down on the page, choose the Stolen Device Protection tab, and move that toggle to the right.",

    "content_text": "What if there were a simple technique that let you photograph what’s directly in front of you and what’s behind you at the same exact time, in the same exact frame? Stefan Falke found a way to capture everything that’s around him not in a distorted 360-degree image but a completely flat perspective.\nIt all started as a visual experiment. One day in 2023, Falke bought a handheld mirror from CVS for $10 with only a vague idea of what he wanted to do with it artistically. He wandered down to the Empire State Building and held the mirror up in front of the lens, directly in the middle of the frame. The squarish mirror captured the Hudson Yards in the reflection.\nReflecting New York is a series of perfectly matched reflections, a pairing of both what’s directly in front of the artist and what’s behind him. Falke perfects the graphics of buildings, trees, and bridges with just a slight manual adjustment to what the mirror captures. “I realized soon that the mirror was an actor in the image, not just the reflection in it,” says Falke. “Then came my hand, which I tried to avoid showing at first, but it became an important part of the series. It became the story: A handheld mirror, my mirror, creates unusual visuals in familiar places.”\nFalke loves to shoot midday in bright light, when most photographers hide. He calls it the “Kodak light.” He requires plenty of daylight because the f-stop is rather tight, controlling the amount of light that enters the lens in order to get sharpness throughout the mirrored picture and the background too. The shutter speed needs to be very fast, too, because the constantly moving mirror, wind factor, one-handed camera holding, and other factors make it difficult to freeze the reflected image. It is enormously difficult to hold the mirror with one hand and shoot with a fairly heavy Nikon D850 in the other and focus on two images at once, aligning everything perfectly.\nFalke never knows what he will shoot or in what direction he’ll wander when he ventures out; he doesn’t plan around the position of the sun, or plan at all really; everything is based on location, and every photograph in the series is found rather than scripted.\nWhen I asked Falke what his favorite image from this series was, he claimed the photograph of Luna Park in Brooklyn's Coney Island with the Cyclone Roller Coaster in the mirror. “It has the perfect composition, color, elements, mood, and my hand and mirror have the right energy,” he says. “Love it.”",

Learn more.\nWould you buy tech hardware from a company best known for making soap?\nCult British cosmetics brand Lush, famed for inventing the bath bomb, is attempting to forge the category of bathroom tech with its first foray into electronics: the Bath Bot, a small, water resistant Bluetooth speaker with colour-changing LEDs that can float in the tub while you soak.\nThe Bath Bot is roughly the size and shape of a Lush bath bomb—spherical on top with a hexagonal base—and can be connected with Lush’s app to play music and soundscapes designed to match the vibe of the brand's famous bath products.\nTrue to Lush’s values, the company claims the speaker is designed with ethics front and center: It’s manufactured in the UK (where it is based), recyclable, and vegan (which basically means it doesn’t use glue). But did I mention it costs $180?\nAdam Goswell, Lush’s tech R&D lead, says the company’s hardware ambitions started with a 2017 trip to Chinese tech hub Shenzhen. At that time, the team had a more ambitious goal in mind: They wanted to build their own tablet. Inspired by the likes of Fairphone, they wondered if, rather than buying thousands of off-the-shelf tablets for their employees to use in-store, they could work with suppliers to produce something as ethically sourced as possible.\nBut the team soon realised that tech is trickier than toiletries in this regard. “Trying to do the supply chain interrogation we do with our normal cosmetics on electronics got really difficult,” Goswell says. They’d ask where a battery came from, or where the components within the battery came from, and suppliers either didn’t know or wouldn’t say. They shelved the tablet idea and eventually landed on Bath Bot as their first hardware project.\nAnnounced over a year ago, the Bot has taken longer than expected to get to market, with some customers complaining about unfulfilled pre-orders or wondering if the product is vaporware. The reason for the delay, says Goswell, was due to Lush’s lack of experience with electronics. The product was ready, but they hadn’t realised how long it would take to get the relevant certifications needed to sell such a device. The Bath Bot is now available in the UK, EU, and will soon be in the US (excepting California, which has extra regulations).\nSome compromises still had to be made during the development. “The components in there aren’t what we would deem as 100 percent ethical, but we tried our best,” says Goswell. The team had wanted to use recycled materials out of environmental concerns but had to opt for virgin plastic to keep the device waterproof. The end result is recyclable though, and Lush says buyers will be able to bring theirs in-store for repairs if needed.\nManufacturing electronics inevitably comes with a carbon cost, but Goswell believes the Bath Bot's is justifiable. “If it was a single-use device or a cheap, throw-away one that broke within six months, I think that would be a different question, but we’ve made it to last,” he says.\nIndeed, a cheap device it is not. The £150 price tag has raised eyebrows even among ardent Lush fans on forums such as the 115k-member r/LushCosmetics subreddit. As one “Lushie” put it, “Why would I buy a $200 speaker from a bath store?” You can get a waterproof Bluetooth speaker from established brands for significantly less, likely with better sound quality: Ultimate Ears’ floating Wonderboom 4 retails for around $100 (and often sells for less), while JBL's cheapest waterproof speakers can sell for as little as $40—you can find some even cheaper on Amazon.\nThe reasons for the high price, Goswell says, include the fact that it’s Lush’s first tech product and the company is not making that many, both of which drive up costs. Trying to choose more ethical components adds to the price, as does manufacturing in the UK. Ultimately, he says, Lush doesn’t want to pitch the Bath Bot against other Bluetooth speakers but sees it as more of a lifestyle accessory, akin to something like a Philips Hue lamp. While it’s designed for use in the bath, he also likes to take it with him to hotel rooms for ambient lighting.\nI decide to test the Bath Bot in its intended environment, running a bath and setting up the Lush app ready to connect. Bath drawn, I drop the bath bot into the water where it duly floats around, cycling through coloured lights that give the illusion of dyeing the bathwater around me. Available in black or white, the Bath Bot has just four buttons—on/off, play/pause, and two volume controls. When I turn it on, it emits a particularly pleasing startup sound featuring birdsong and a few gentle guitar notes.\nIn the Lush app, I find a playlist that matches the bath bomb I’m using: Ickle Bot ($8, sold separately), a baby blue, robot-shaped thing. I chose it because it looked cute, but as the playlist opens with lullaby-style music, I realise it may be intended for children (afterwards, I look online and see that it is indeed suitable for ages six months and above).\nRegardless, the experience starts off appropriately relaxing; an indie singer croons soothingly over gentle piano in a track like a slowed-down sea shanty, while the multicoloured LEDs cycle in tempo. Most of the music in the Lush app is from Lush’s own record label; the company commissions music for its spas and occasionally releases records. The sound quality isn’t up to that of my usual UE Boom portable speaker, but it’s perfectly adequate for the job and perhaps better than I expected given the speaker size—at least in the less-than-ideal testing environment of my rather echoey bathroom.\nMy peaceful bathing is somewhat disrupted, however, when the first Ickle Bot song segues into ambient sounds of water splashing and children shrieking. This not being my idea of relaxation, I try some of the other playlists, designed around different bath bombs. Magic Bus plays rather generic-sounding rave beats; Sex Bomb starts with some bell chiming that I don’t find particularly seductive. Annoyingly, I also find that the music stops playing when I click to explore different parts of the Lush app or open other apps on my phone.\nAfter a while, I head to Spotify and choose music I know I actually like, which I imagine is how most people will end up using the Bath Bot. When I shift in the water, the speaker bobs about; it sounds louder or quieter as it floats from my shoulders to my feet and occasionally clunks inelegantly against the side of the tub.\nAs I go to pull out the plug, I’ve had an enjoyable bath, but I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a “super-powered sensory bathing experience,” as Lush advertises. And despite Goswell’s protestations that the Bath Bot is a product for the long-term, I can’t help but think that many may use it a few times before discarding it as a gimmick.\nGoswell admits that making the Bath Bot was a risk; the company spent “significant money” on R&D and manufacturing to make a product that you wouldn’t expect from a cosmetics company. But he insists that even if it turns out not to be a commercial success, the process of developing a first hardware product has been invaluable. His team is now considering making Bath Bot accessories and more content for the app. They’re also thinking up other bathroom tech—one suggestion is using the water flow from a shower to power a device, like hydropower on a tiny scale.\nBut their ambitions also stretch further. Headquartered in Poole, on the UK’s south coast, the company is interested in larger-scale tidal power and has just co-funded a three-year PhD studentship at nearby Bournemouth University.\nWhile this will explore the development of a new tidal energy station at Poole Harbor to power Lush's head office operations, Goswell also floats the idea of using tidal to power servers for a large language model. It could be a way, he says, of creating an AI-assisted digital experience while mitigating some of the carbon concerns.",

    "content_text": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nFar from being solo operators, most single-celled microbes are in complex relationships. In the ocean, the soil, and your gut, they might battle and eat each other, exchange DNA, compete for nutrients, or feed on one another’s by-products. Sometimes they get even more intimate: One cell might slip inside another and make itself comfortable. If the conditions are just right, it might stay and be welcomed, sparking a relationship that could last for generations—or billions of years. This phenomenon of one cell living inside another, called endosymbiosis, has fueled the evolution of complex life.\nExamples of endosymbiosis are everywhere. Mitochondria, the energy factories in your cells, were once free-living bacteria. Photosynthetic plants owe their sun-spun sugars to the chloroplast, which was also originally an independent organism. Many insects get essential nutrients from bacteria that live inside them. And last year researchers discovered the “nitroplast,” an endosymbiont that helps some algae process nitrogen.\nSo much of life relies on endosymbiotic relationships, but scientists have struggled to understand how they happen. How does an internalized cell evade digestion? How does it learn to reproduce inside its host? What makes a random merger of two independent organisms into a stable, lasting partnership?\nNow, for the first time, researchers have watched the opening choreography of this microscopic dance by inducing endosymbiosis in the lab. After injecting bacteria into a fungus—a process that required creative problem-solving (and a bicycle pump)—the researchers managed to spark cooperation without killing the bacteria or the host. Their observations offer a glimpse into the conditions that make it possible for the same thing to happen in the microbial wild.\nThe cells even adjusted to each other faster than anticipated. “To me, this means that organisms want to actually live together, and symbiosis is the norm,” said Vasilis Kokkoris, a mycologist who studies the cell biology of symbiosis at VU University in Amsterdam and wasn’t involved in the new study. “So that’s big, big news for me and for this world.”\nEarly attempts that fell short reveal that most cellular love affairs are unsuccessful. But by understanding how, why, and when organisms accept endosymbionts, researchers can better understand key moments in evolution, and also potentially develop synthetic cells engineered with superpowered endosymbionts.\nThe Cell Wall Breakthrough\nJulia Vorholt, a microbiologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich in Switzerland, has long puzzled over the circumstances of endosymbiosis. Researchers in the field theorized that once a bacterium sneaks into a host cell, the relationship teeters between infection and harmony. If the bacterium reproduces too quickly, it risks depleting the host’s resources and triggering an immune response, resulting in the death of the guest, the host, or both. If it reproduces too slowly, it won’t establish itself in the cell. Only in rare cases, they thought, does the bacterium achieve a Goldilocks reproductive rate. Then, to become a true endosymbiont, it must infiltrate its host’s reproductive cycle to hitch a ride to the next generation. Finally, the host’s genome must eventually mutate to accommodate the bacterium—allowing the two to evolve as a unit.\n“They become addicted to each other,” Vorholt said.\nThese ideas made logical sense, but no one had ever witnessed the early steps of microbial endosymbiosis. So Vorholt decided to try to make it happen in the lab. Rather than reinventing the endosymbiotic wheel, she thought her team would have its best shot if it re-created a partnership that had already occurred in nature.\nRice seedling blight is a disease caused by the toxic by-product of a wild, endosymbiotic affair. At some point in its evolutionary history, the fungus Rhizopus microsporus adopted the bacterium Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica. The bacterial resident produces poison, which the fungus uses to infect rice plants; both partners benefit by absorbing nutrients from the dead and dying plant cells. Over generations, the pair have become so intertwined that now the fungus can’t reproduce without its endosymbiont.\nHowever, there is a strain of the fungus that lives without the endosymbiont. Vorholt thought she could use it to re-create the poisonous partnership. Before she got to the harder steps of cellular matchmaking, though, her team had to overcome a basic physical constraint: How do you physically squeeze a bacterium through a fungus’s rigid cell wall?\nGabriel Giger, lead author on the paper and Vorholt’s graduate student, started by cooking up a cocktail of enzymes to soften the wall. Then he used an atomic force microscope equipped with a technology known as FluidFM, repurposed to serve as a tiny syringe. When Giger punctured the fungal cell with the microneedle, cytoplasm came rushing out like water from a burst dam.\n“We had so much backflush,” Giger said. “[The cell fluid] just comes shooting right at you.”\nHe needed something with more oomph to resist the intracellular pressure and push the bacteria in. Giger jury-rigged a connection between his bike pump and the microscope. It worked: The bike pump boosted the pressure and forced the bacteria through the cell wall and into the cytoplasm.\nAfter tinkering with different amounts of pressure, they refined the system. “The way they adapted technology to inject the bacteria into fungus is really, really cool,” said Thomas Richards, an evolutionary biologist who studies endosymbiosis at the University of Oxford and wasn’t involved in the study. “They had to use special sharpened needles and then three times the tire pressure of car tires to push that bacteria inside. That represents a big technological step forward.”\nGiger and Vorholt first injected the fungus with Escherichia coli, a standard bacterial lab organism. Once inside, E. coli reproduced quickly as it fed on nutrients within the cell. The bacteria grew so fast that the fungal immune system noticed them—and handily locked them away for disposal.\nThen the researchers moved on to M. rhizoxinica, the bacteria already established within other R. microsporus strains. Once inside, it divided at an agreeable rate and evaded the immune response. Most importantly, neither partner died. “It was already super exciting to see that both the fungus and the bacteria grew after injection,” Giger said\nThe pair had initially accepted each other, but that was only the first step. Giger patiently waited, and then he saw what he was looking for under the microscope: The bacteria had wiggled their way into the fungal spores to hitchhike to the next generation.\n“I had to make sure the signal was the real deal, and you don’t sleep soundly until you know,” he said. “The excitement lasted for quite a while.”\nGiger and the team hand-selected spores and germinated 10 successive generations of fungi. More bacteria survived in each reproductive round, and the spores got healthier and more efficient. For the first time, researchers watched endosymbiotic and host microbes adapt to each other. “Neither of these organisms is poisoning each other, and their growth rates roughly match this spectrum of viability for both,” Giger recalled. The bacteria survived, protected and fed by the fungus—and the fungus scored a poisonous partner.\nTo confirm the microbial partnership, the lab isolated both parties to analyze their genomes. Already, the fungus genome had gained mutations to accommodate the bacteria. Clearly, these relationships can stabilize quickly, the researchers saw. Soon the two species couldn’t live without each other.\nStriking the Right Balance\nBy re-creating a natural relationship, Vorholt and Giger have “rerun that tape of evolution,” Richards said, to learn lessons about how endosymbiosis happens. They concluded that the process can’t happen if there is a mismatch between host and endosymbiont at any point in the adaptation process. “That’s probably what happens in nature a lot,” Vorholt said. “Maybe their starting points are successful, but somehow the selection is not there, or there is a cost rather than a benefit. And then you just lose the system, and it doesn’t get stabilized.”\nThey also learned that in pairings that work, both partners adapt to each other—a phenomenon that has been largely overlooked. It wasn’t just the bacteria adapting to a new environment; the host changed too, even in the early stages. “That is a fundamentally important question that people have ignored,” Richards said. “This opens the doors for real advances.”\nWhile illuminating, this bacterium-fungus pairing is only one example of a process that may have a number of mechanisms or conditions. “I can imagine that in protists and other groups that have not been well studied, we will find many new patterns of how symbiosis is supported,” said Laila Partida Martínez, who discovered the rice seedling–blight endosymbiosis and is now director of Cinvestav Irapuato, a plant science research institute in Mexico.\nMore research in a variety of endosymbiotic systems will reveal which conditions apply generally and which are specific to certain pairs. Further down the line, those findings could lead to a new kind of synthetic biology, featuring lab-grown endosymbiotic relationships, which could be a “fascinating avenue to explore biological innovation,” Vorholt said.\nInstead of editing organisms’ genes to create new traits, labs could engineer bacteria to perform specific functions and then slip them into hosts. “Many new features could be brought together in a symbiotic system by doing this and making them evolve together,” Partida Martínez said. By inducing endosymbiosis, researchers could potentially engineer plants to metabolize pollutants or manufacture medicines. “It will take time to design and to really tune the systems,” she added. “I think our imagination would be actually the limit.”\nDoes that mean we could one day gain chloroplasts and become photosynthetic? Giger thinks it would be difficult for a chloroplast to stabilize inside a mammalian cell. Even if it did work, photosynthesis alone wouldn’t fuel us—our energy demands are too high. “You might get fancy green skin and run a little bit on your own photovoltaics, but the energy gain that you could get from the sun would be minimal,” he said. “You’d go hungry a lot and need to supplement with other staples, such as pizza.”\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

In the ocean, the soil, and your gut, they might battle and eat each other, exchange <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/dna/\">DNA</a>, compete for nutrients, or feed on one another’s by-products. Sometimes they get even more intimate: One <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/cells/\">cell</a> might slip inside another and make itself comfortable. If the conditions are just right, it might stay and be welcomed, sparking a relationship that could last for generations—or billions of years. This phenomenon of one cell living inside another, called endosymbiosis, has fueled the evolution of complex life.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">Examples of endosymbiosis are everywhere. Mitochondria, the energy factories in your cells, <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/meet-the-eukaryote-the-first-cell-to-get-organized-20241028/\">were once free-living bacteria</a>. Photosynthetic plants owe their sun-spun sugars to the chloroplast, which was also originally an independent organism. Many insects get essential nutrients <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/symbiotic-bacteria-tell-ant-embryos-how-to-develop-20200909/\">from bacteria that live inside them</a>. And last year researchers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adk1075\" target=\"_blank\">discovered the “nitroplast,”</a> an endosymbiont that helps some algae process nitrogen.</p><p class=\"paywall\">So much of life relies on endosymbiotic relationships, but scientists have struggled to understand how they happen. How does an internalized cell evade digestion? How does it learn to reproduce inside its host? What makes a random merger of two independent organisms into a stable, lasting partnership?</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Now, for the first time, researchers have watched the opening choreography of this microscopic dance by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08010-x\" target=\"_blank\">inducing endosymbiosis in the lab</a>. After injecting bacteria into a fungus—a process that required creative problem-solving (and a bicycle pump)—the researchers managed to spark cooperation without killing the bacteria or the host. Their observations offer a glimpse into the conditions that make it possible for the same thing to happen in the microbial wild.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The cells even adjusted to each other faster than anticipated. “To me, this means that organisms want to actually live together, and symbiosis is the norm,” said <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.vasilis-kokkoris.com/about-me\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.vasilis-kokkoris.com/about-me\" href=\"https://www.vasilis-kokkoris.com/about-me\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vasilis Kokkoris</a>, a mycologist who studies the cell biology of symbiosis at VU University in Amsterdam and wasn’t involved in the new study. “So that’s big, big news for me and for this world.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Early attempts that fell short reveal that most cellular love affairs are unsuccessful. But by understanding how, why, and when organisms accept endosymbionts, researchers can better understand key moments in evolution, and also potentially develop synthetic cells engineered with superpowered endosymbionts.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">The Cell Wall Breakthrough</h2><p class=\"paywall\"><a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://micro.biol.ethz.ch/research/vorholt.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://micro.biol.ethz.ch/research/vorholt.html\" href=\"https://micro.biol.ethz.ch/research/vorholt.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Julia Vorholt</a>, a microbiologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich in Switzerland, has long puzzled over the circumstances of endosymbiosis. Researchers in the field theorized that once a bacterium sneaks into a host cell, the relationship teeters between infection and harmony. If the bacterium reproduces too quickly, it risks depleting the host’s resources and triggering an immune response, resulting in the death of the guest, the host, or both. If it reproduces too slowly, it won’t establish itself in the cell. Only in rare cases, they thought, does the bacterium achieve a Goldilocks reproductive rate. Then, to become a true endosymbiont, it must infiltrate its host’s reproductive cycle to hitch a ride to the next generation. Finally, the host’s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/genomics/\">genome</a> must eventually mutate to accommodate the bacterium—allowing the two to evolve as a unit.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“They become addicted to each other,” Vorholt said.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Although fans of A Song of Ice and Fire might still be hankering for the long-delayed next book in the series, bestselling sci-fi/fantasy author George R.R. Martin has instead added a different item to his long list of publications: a peer-reviewed physics paper just published in the American Journal of Physics that he coauthored. The paper derives a formula to describe the dynamics of a fictional virus that is the centerpiece of the Wild Cards series of books, a shared universe edited by Martin and Melinda M. Snodgrass, with some 44 authors contributing.\nWild Cards grew out of the Superworld RPG, specifically a long-running campaign game-mastered by Martin in the 1980s, with several of the original sci-fi writers who contributed to the series participating. (A then-unknown Neil Gaiman once pitched Martin a Wild Cards story involving a main character who lived in a world of dreams. Martin rejected the pitch, and Gaiman’s idea became The Sandman.) Initially, Martin planned to write a novel centered on his character Turtle, but he then decided it would be better as a shared universe anthology. Martin thought that superhero comics had far too many sources of the many different superpowers and wanted his universe to have one single source. Snodgrass suggested a virus.\nThe series is basically an alternate history of the US in the aftermath of World War II. An airborne alien virus, designed to rewrite DNA, had been released over New York City in 1946 and spread globally, infecting tens of thousands worldwide. It's called the Wild Card virus because it affects every individual differently. It kills 90 percent of those it infects and mutates the rest. Nine percent of the latter end up with unpleasant conditions—these people are called Jokers—while 1 percent develop superpowers and are known as Aces. Some Aces have “powers” that are so trivial and useless that they are known as “deuces.”\nThere has been considerable speculation on the Wild Cards website discussing the science behind that virus, and it caught the attention of Ian Tregillis, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, who thought it might make a useful pedagogical exercise. “Being a theoretician, I couldn't help but wonder if a simple underlying model might tidy up the canon,” Tregillis said. “Like any physicist, I started with back-of-the-envelope estimates, but then I went off the deep end. Eventually I suggested, only half-jokingly, that it might be easier to write a genuine physics paper than another blog post.”\nA Physicist Walks Into a Fictional Universe …\nTregillis naturally engaged in a bit of willing suspension of disbelief, given that the question of how any virus could give humans superpowers that defy the laws of physics is inherently unanswerable. He focused on the origin of the Wild Cards universe's 90:9:1 rule, adopting the mindset of an in-universe theoretician keen to build a coherent mathematical framework that could describe the viral behavior. The ultimate goal was to “demonstrate the wide-ranging flexibility and utility of physics concepts by converting this vague and seemingly unapproachable problem to a straightforward dynamic system, thereby putting a wealth of conceptual and mathematical tools at students’ disposal,” Tregillis and Martin wrote in their paper.\nAmong the issues the paper addresses is the problem of Jokers and Aces as \"mutually exclusive categories with a numerical distribution attainable to the roll of a hundred-sided die,\" the authors wrote. \"Yet the canon abounds with characters who confound this categorization: 'Joker-Aces,' who exhibit both a physical mutation and a superhuman ability.\"\nThey also suggest the existence of \"cryptos\": Jokers and Aces with mutations that are largely unobservable, such as producing ultraviolet racing stripes on someone's heart or imbuing \"a resident of Iowa with the power of line-of-sight telepathic communication with narwhals. The first individual would be unaware of their Jokerism; the second would be an Ace but never known it.\" (One might argue that communicating with narwhals might make one a Deuce.)\nIn the end, Tregillis and Martin came up with three ground rules: (1) cryptos exist, but how many of them exist is \"unknown and unknowable\"; (2) observable card turns would be distributed according to the 90:9:1 rule; and (3) viral outcomes would be determined by a multivariate probability distribution.\nThe resulting proposed model assumes two apparently random variables: severity of the transformation—i.e., how much the virus changes a person, either in the severity of a Joker's deformation or the potency of an Ace's superpower—and a mixing angle to address the existence of Joker-Aces. \"Card turns that land sufficiently close to one axis will subjectively present as Aces, while otherwise they will present as Jokers or Joker-Aces,\" the authors wrote.\nThe derived formula is one that takes into account the many different ways a given system can evolve (aka a Langrangian formulation). “We translated the abstract problem of Wild Card viral outcomes into a simple, concrete dynamical system. The time-averaged behavior of this system generates the statistical distribution of outcomes,” said Tregillis.\nTregillis acknowledges that this might not be a good exercise for the beginning physics student, given that it involves multiple steps and covers many concepts that younger students might not fully comprehend. Nor does he suggest adding it to the core curriculum. Instead, he recommends it for senior honors seminars to encourage students to explore an open-ended research question.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "After Google’s beta test in Brazil, the initial suite of theft protection features for Android smartphones is now widely available—but you have to opt in.\nWhy isn’t the company automatically adding the protections to every compatible device? Insight from the Brazil beta test helped developers at the company make this decision. “We learned that users behaved very differently in metropolitan areas and in rural areas,” says Jianing Sandra Guo, an Android security and privacy product manager at Google. She doesn’t want to add unnecessary friction for users who aren’t as interested in the anti-theft software.\nThree features many Android owners can activate now are Theft Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, and Remote Lock. Curious about using these protective features on your Android smartphone? Here’s a peek into how the detection happens using artificial intelligence and steps for how to activate the anti-theft features.\nHow Does Android Theft Detection Work?\nSince many thefts can be violent or involve sudden, jerky movements, Guo sought ad vice from Google’s Activity Recognition team, which worked on a somewhat similar feature available on Pixel smartphones for car crash detection. “At a very high level, it starts with motion sensors,” she says. But, an approach solely focused on sudden movements could lead to so many false triggers, users would likely find the option more annoying than beneficial—and that’s where machine learning, a segment of AI focused on pattern recognition, comes into play.\nThe Google developers researched smartphone theft methods used in different parts of the globe and role-played the robberies for training data. “We reenact those scenarios. Then we gather the trace of the device,” says Guo. “We use AI to compile those traces into a model to try to predict the next time when a snatch happens.” For Android owners, this process is done using on-device models.\nThe AI model is not static, and developers plan to continue adding new smartphone theft scenarios to the training data as criminals modify their behavior. Also, with the global launch of these anti-theft features, they can now learn more about how a diverse group of smartphone owners actually interact with these options.\nHow Do I Turn It On?\nGo ahead and see if your phone is running a recent version of the Android operating system. Your device needs to be on at least Android 10 to run these three features, and the latest Android 15 software gives you access to more security options. It’s a basic first step, but if you haven’t already, also add a passcode to your device by going into the privacy settings.\nNext, open the Settings app on your phone and search for Theft protection. Opening this tab will show the three lock screen safety features. “It's very common for the cell phone to assume that the person who has access to it is the rightful owner,” says Guo. By adding more ways to activate the lock screen, users have more protections if their phone is nabbed while open. When the Theft Detection Lock is toggled on, the screen will automatically lock if it detects a potential robbery, based on movement patterns as well as whether your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth remains connected.\nWith Offline Device Lock activated, your phone will go to the lock screen, up to twice a day, if the internet is suddenly turned off for a while or airplane mode is activated. “From our market research, that is a common attack that they carry out after taking an unlocked device,” says Guo. Why would thieves do this? When a device is offline, it can’t be remotely reset via Find My Device to clear your personal information from the device.\nThe third lock screen security option available on this page is Remote Lock. You’ll have to click on the name to see this toggle, unlike the first two options. The feature is designed to give you a quick, easily accessible choice to lock your phone by visiting android.com/lock on any device and entering your phone number. However, Remote Lock will only work twice a day and activate when the smartphone is online.",

For instance, our analysis of data from market research company Ipsos spanning 27 countries reveals that people in nations with lower average AI literacy are more receptive toward AI adoption than those in nations with higher literacy.\nSimilarly, our survey of US undergraduate students finds that those with less understanding of AI are more likely to indicate using it for tasks like academic assignments.\nThe reason behind this link lies in how AI now performs tasks we once thought only humans could do. When AI creates a piece of art, writes a heartfelt response, or plays a musical instrument, it can feel almost magical—like it’s crossing into human territory.\nOf course, AI doesn’t actually possess human qualities. A chatbot might generate an empathetic response, but it doesn’t feel empathy. People with more technical knowledge about AI understand this.\nThey know how algorithms (sets of mathematical rules used by computers to carry out particular tasks), training data (used to improve how an AI system works), and computational models operate. This makes the technology less mysterious.\nOn the other hand, those with less understanding may see AI as magical and awe inspiring. We suggest this sense of magic makes them more open to using AI tools.\nOur studies show this lower literacy-higher receptivity link is strongest for using AI tools in areas people associate with human traits, like providing emotional support or counseling. When it comes to tasks that don’t evoke the same sense of humanlike qualities—such as analyzing test results—the pattern flips. People with higher AI literacy are more receptive to these uses because they focus on AI’s efficiency, rather than any “magical” qualities.\nIt’s Not About Capability, Fear, or Ethics\nInterestingly, this link between lower literacy and higher receptivity persists even though people with lower AI literacy are more likely to view AI as less capable, less ethical, and even a bit scary. Their openness to AI seems to stem from their sense of wonder about what it can do, despite these perceived drawbacks.\nThis finding offers new insights into why people respond so differently to emerging technologies. Some studies suggest consumers favour new tech, a phenomenon called “algorithm appreciation,” while others show skepticism, or “algorithm aversion.” Our research points to perceptions of AI’s “magicalness” as a key factor shaping these reactions.\nThese insights pose a challenge for policymakers and educators. Efforts to boost AI literacy might unintentionally dampen people’s enthusiasm for using AI by making it seem less magical. This creates a tricky balance between helping people understand AI and keeping them open to its adoption.\nTo make the most of AI’s potential, businesses, educators and policymakers need to strike this balance. By understanding how perceptions of “magicalness” shape people’s openness to AI, we can help develop and deploy new AI-based products and services that take the way people view AI into account, and help them understand the benefits and risks of AI.\nAnd ideally, this will happen without causing a loss of the awe that inspires many people to embrace this new technology.",

    "content_text": "This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nWhat’s shaping up to be one of the worst wildfire disasters in US history had many causes. Before the blazes raged across Los Angeles last week, eight months with hardly any rain had left the brush-covered landscape bone-dry. Santa Ana winds blew through the mountains, their gusts turning small fires into infernos and sending embers flying miles ahead. As many as 12,000 buildings have burned down, some hundred thousand people have fled their homes, and at least two dozen people have died.\nAs winds picked up again this week, key questions about the fires remain unanswered: What sparked the flames in the first place? And could they have been prevented? Some theorize that the Eaton Fire in Pasadena was caused by wind-felled power lines, or that the Palisades Fire was seeded by the embers of a smaller fire the week before. But the list of possible culprits is long—even a car engine idling over dry grass can ignite a fire.\n“To jump to any conclusions right now is speculation,” said Ginger Colbrun, a spokesperson for the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the lead agency investigating the cause of the Palisades Fire, to the Los Angeles Times. Figuring it out will likely take months. It took the bureau more than a year to conclude that the fire in August 2023 that devastated Lahaina, Maui, which was similarly lashed by high winds, was started by broken power lines.\nEven given enough time, the causes of the Los Angeles fires might remain a mystery. According to a recent study, authorities never find the source of ignition for more than half of all of wildfires in the Western US—a knowledge gap that can hamper prevention efforts even as climate change ramps up the frequency of these deadly events. If authorities can anticipate likely causes of a fire, they can help build more resilient neighborhoods and educate the public on how to avoid the next deadly event.\n“Fire research is so incredibly difficult. It’s more difficult than looking for a needle in the haystack,” said Costas Synolakis, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies natural disasters. Synolakis said fires with especially high temperatures, such as those in Los Angeles, often obliterate the evidence. “That’s why it’s so challenging to mitigate fire losses,” he said. “You just don’t know what triggers them.”\nThe US Forest Service is teaming up with computer scientists to see if artificial intelligence can help crack old cases. A study led by data scientists at Boise State University, published in the journal Earth’s Future earlier this month, analyzed the conditions surrounding more than 150,000 unsolved wildfire cases from 1992 to 2020 in Western states and found that 80 percent of wildfires were likely caused by people (whether accidentally or intentionally), with lightning responsible for just 20 percent. According to Cal Fire, people have caused 95 percent of California’s wildfires.\nKaren Short, a research ecologist with the Forest Service who contributed to the study and maintains a historical database of national wildfire reports, says understanding why they start is essential for preventing them and educating the public. Strategic prevention appears to work: According to the National Fire Protection Association, house fires in the US have decreased by nearly half since the 1980s.\nIn 2024, Short expanded her wildfire archive to include more information useful to investigators, such as weather, elevation, population density, and a fire’s timing. “We need to have those things captured in the data to track them over time. We still track things from the 1900s,” she said.\nAccording to Short, wildfire trends across the western United States have shifted with human activity. In recent decades, ignitions from power lines, fireworks, and firearms have become more common, in contrast with the railroad- and sawmill-caused fires that were once more common.\nThe study found that vehicles and equipment are likely the number one culprit, potentially causing 21 percent of wildfires without a known cause since 1992. Last fall, the Airport Fire in California was just such an event, burning over 23,000 acres. And an increasing number of fires are the result of arson and accidental ignition—whether from smoking, gunfire, or campfires—that make up another 18 percent. In 2017, an Arizona couple’s choice of a blue smoke-spewing firework for a baby gender reveal party lit the Sawmill Fire, torching close to 47,000 acres.\nBut these results aren’t definitive. Machine-learning models such as those used for the study are trained to predict the likelihood of a given fire’s cause, rather than prove that a particular ignition happened. Although the study’s model showed 90 percent accuracy selecting between lightning or human activity as the ignition source when tested on fires with known causes, it had more difficulty determining exactly which of 11 possible human behaviors were to blame, only getting it right half the time.\nYavar Pourmohamad, a data science PhD researcher at Boise State University who led the study, says that knowing the probable causes of a fire could help authorities warn people in high-risk areas before a blaze actually starts. “It could give people a hint of what is most important to be careful of,” he said. “Maybe in the future, AI can become a trustworthy tool for real-world action.”\nSynolakis, the USC professor, says Pourmohamad and Short’s research is important for understanding how risks are changing. He advocates for proactive actions like burying power lines underground where they can’t be buffeted by winds.\nA 2018 study found that fires set off by downed power lines—such as the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, that same year—have been increasing. Although the authors note that while power lines do not account for many fires, they’re associated with larger swaths of burned land.\n“We have to really make sure that our communities are more resilient to climate change,” Synolakis said. “As we’re seeing with the extreme conditions in Los Angeles, fire suppression alone doesn’t do it.”",

    "content_text": "This week started off with a bang and just kept going. In the wee hours of Saturday night, TikTok cut off access to users in the United States ahead of Sunday’s deadline that forced Apple and Google to remove the video-sharing app from their app stores. While TikTok was dark, US users raced to get around the TikTok ban while several other unexpected apps saw their access to Americans severed as well. By midday on Sunday, however, TikTok access was already coming back in the US. By Monday night, newly inaugurated US president Donald Trump had signed an executive order delaying the TikTok ban by 75 days.\nOn Tuesday, Trump made good on his promise to free Ross Ulbricht, the imprisoned creator of the Silk Road dark-web market, where users sold drugs, guns, and worse. Ulbricht had spent more than 11 years behind bars after he was arrested by the FBI in 2013 and later sentenced to life in prison. Trump’s decision to pardon Ulbricht is largely seen as linked to the support he’s received from the libertarian cryptocurrency community, which has long considered the Silk Road creator a martyr.\nAs the world enters the second Trump era, WIRED sat down with Jen Easterly, who recently left her top spot as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to discuss the cyber threats facing the US and CISA’s uncertain future as the frontline watchdog against nation-state hackers and other digital security threats facing the US.\nLastly, we detailed new research that revealed how trivial bugs had exposed Subaru’s system for tracking the locations of its customers’ vehicles. The researchers found they could access a web portal for Subaru employees that allowed them to pinpoint up to a years’ worth of a car’s location—down to the parking spots they use. The flaws are now patched, but Subaru employees still have access to sensitive driver location data.\nThat’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\nJudge Says Controversial FBI Searches Require a Warrant\nA US judge in New York this week found that the FBI’s practice of searching data on US persons under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act without obtaining a warrant is unconstitutional. FISA gives the US government the authority to collect the communications of foreign entities through internet providers and companies like Apple and Google. Once this data was collected, the FBI could perform “backdoor searches” for information on US citizens or residents who communicated with foreigners, and it did so without first obtaining a warrant. Judge DeArcy Hall found that these searches do require a warrant. “To hold otherwise would effectively allow law enforcement to amass a repository of communications under Section 702—including those of US persons—that can later be searched on demand without limitation,” the judge wrote.\nCloudflare Function Could Expose App Users’ Rough Location\nAn “issue” with the basic functionality of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare’s content delivery network, or CDN, can reveal the coarse location of people using apps, including those meant for protecting privacy, according to findings from an independent security researcher. Cloudflare has servers in hundreds of cities and more than 100 countries around the world. Its CDN works by caching peoples’ internet traffic across its servers then delivering that data from the server closest to a person’s location. The security researcher, who goes by Daniel, found a way to send an image to a target, collect the URL, then use a custom-built tool to query Cloudflare to find out which data center delivered the image—and thus the state or possibly the city the target is in. Fortunately, Cloudflare tells 404 Media that it fixed the issue after Daniel reported it.\nTrump Administration Disbands Review Board Investigating China’s Salt Typhoon Attacks\nIn one of its first moves after Trump took office on Monday, the Department of Homeland Security let go everyone on the agency’s advisory committees. This includes the Cyber Safety Review Board, which was investigating widespread attacks on the US telecommunications system by the China-backed hacker group Salt Typhoon. US authorities revealed in mid-November that Salt Typhoon had embedded itself in at least nine US telecoms for espionage purposes, potentially exposing anyone using unencrypted calls and text message to surveillance by Beijing. While the future of the CSRB remains uncertain, sources tell reporter Eric Geller that their investigation into Salt Typhoon’s attacks is effectively “dead.”",

FISA gives the US government the authority to collect the communications of foreign entities through internet providers and companies like Apple and Google. Once this data was collected, the FBI could perform “backdoor searches” for information on US citizens or residents who communicated with foreigners, and it did so without first obtaining a warrant. Judge DeArcy Hall found that these searches do require a warrant. “To hold otherwise would effectively allow law enforcement to amass a repository of communications under Section 702—including those of US persons—that can later be searched on demand without limitation,” the judge wrote.</p><p class=\"paywall\">An “issue” with the basic functionality of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare’s content delivery network, or CDN, can reveal the coarse location of people using apps, including those meant for protecting privacy, according to findings from an independent security researcher. Cloudflare has servers in hundreds of cities and more than 100 countries around the world. Its CDN works by caching peoples’ internet traffic across its servers then delivering that data from the server closest to a person’s location. The security researcher, who goes by Daniel, found a way to send an image to a target, collect the URL, then use a custom-built tool to query Cloudflare to find out which data center delivered the image—and thus the state or possibly the city the target is in. Fortunately, Cloudflare tells 404 Media that it fixed the issue after Daniel reported it.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In one of its first moves after Trump took office on Monday, the Department of Homeland Security let go everyone on the agency’s advisory committees.

    "content_text": "When Taylor Swift started dating Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in September 2023, sports betting fans were less than enthused.\nRobert Cooper, BetOnline.ag sportsbook director, remembers the reaction from pitching early Swift-themed prop bets, novelty wagers that don’t affect a game’s outcome or take place outside the game entirely, to football media. “Don't send me this S-H-I-T,” he recalls them saying. “Send me football top 10 [betting odds] and that's it.”\nBut Swift’s appearances at Chiefs games over the next several months generated an estimated $331.5 million in brand value for the team and the NFL. She was credited with ratcheting up viewership ratings, particularly among women, in the 2023-24 NFL season, and spurring a flood of press coverage and merchandise sales in the process. By the time the Chiefs faced the San Francisco 49ers in the 2024 Super Bowl, there was another love story at play. Swift had been mainstreamed in the multibillion-dollar sports betting industry, was mentioned on betting podcasts, integrated into sportsbook social media promotions, and inspired prop bets on which millions of dollars have since been wagered worldwide.\nThe way the sports betting industry has leveraged Swift’s fame is indicative of a larger reframing of the public’s relationship with online gambling. By extending it beyond the world of sports and tying prop bets and social media promotions into larger news cycles, companies like FanDuel and DraftKings can attract new audiences from not just Swifties but a wide range of fandoms.\nBetMGM memorably announced that the “Taylor Swift effect” led to a 51 percent increase in women betting. (The company didn’t share the betting figures that this increase is based on, or respond to questions from WIRED.)\nThat spike could be attributed at least in part to Swifties being able to wager on the Super Bowl using prepackaged sets named after their favorite Taylor Swift song titles. Other Swiftie prop bets were even more populist. BetOnline.ag offered bettors 89 Taylor Swift–themed prop bets for last year’s Super Bowl, including the primary color of her top at the Super Bowl and whether her screen time would exceed 28.5 seconds. (While offering prop bets directly on Swift’s actions is widely prohibited in the US, BetOnline.ag is licensed in Panama.)\nBut with the 2024-25 NFL season winding down, and the Chiefs facing off against the Buffalo Bills in the American Football Conference championship game this weekend, the Taylor Swift effect appears to be blunted.\nPublic relations representative for BetOnline.ag, Josh Barton notes that last year Swift “would be shown double-digit times on TV,” but this year her onscreen presence was diminished. Despite attending at least one game in person every month this season while finishing her Eras world tour, she’s attended fewer than in 2023-24.\nThat appears to have made an impact on betting volume. Ahead of the Chiefs’ September 24, 2023, game, when bets on the Chiefs at FanDuel increased by 247 percent, compared to the team's game the previous week. “They were rooting for him to score a touchdown, in large part because they wanted to see her celebrate in the box,” says Chris Jones, vice president of communications at FanDuel. The handle, or money wagered on these bets, increased by 533 percent over the prior week. A more typical increase might be 20 or 30 percent, he adds.\nIt’s hard to quantify the Swiftie demographic’s impact on these bets, but preseason, WIRED reached out to several sportsbooks including BetRivers, DraftKings, FanDuel and Rivalry, which said the Taylor Swift effect was real, and expected it would continue to affect their industry this season.\nTim Whitehead, sportsbook head at BetRivers, put it succinctly. “So long as the world’s biggest pop star is still dating one of the NFL’s most popular players, we’ll tap into that narrative to attract new audiences,” he told WIRED in a statement. But even early in the year, despite Kelce still attracting strong wagers, the outsized Swift effect seemed to have worn off. FanDuel noted that in two early games, neither attended by Swift, teammates of Kelce’s garnered similar betting levels to him. This month, a FanDuel spokesperson told WIRED that interest in betting on Kelce “has leveled out to be in line with the other playmakers on the Chiefs.”\nMichael Naraine, an associate professor of sport management at Brock University in Canada, attributes this to the US election dominating news and prop betting cycles, along with less attention-grabbing headlines in the couple’s relationship as they settled into their partnership. “The T. Swift effect does still exist, it just has been muted over the last year,” he says. “It's not as topical, it's not as high a momentum, but it's still valuable to the books.”\nA study from the University of Queensland in Australia published in December found nearly 90 percent of the country’s regular sports bettors are male, and suggested that this was due, at least partially, to physical betting spaces being “male-dominated” over history, though smartphones make gambling more accessible to female audiences. This pattern holds in other countries, like the US, where only 28 percent of current sports bettors of 2,000 surveyed were women according to a two-week poll by YouGov last year. “It is unsurprising that betting companies are attempting to capitalise on this shift, targeting women with novelty bets like how many awards Taylor Swift will win at this year’s Grammy’s,” author Rohann Irving said in a release about the study.\nDespite the outsize attention Swift’s received from online sportsbooks since dating Kelce, she is only one character in a chorus in the new wave of narrative betting that has risen alongside the industry. In the past, betting narratives which struck chords with bettors focused on underdog or champion players and teams. Today the tales spun have expanded to include a wide array of competitions, from the Oscars, to the US presidential election, to reality TV shows.\nJones, from FanDuel, says ardent sports gamblers give little shrift to this trend. “They’re looking at defensive matchups, offensive matchups, weather, historical data; they’re not caring who the guy’s dating,” he says. But many recreational bettors—whom Jones says make up “an overwhelming majority” of FanDuel’s customer base—seek out narratives like the Swift-Kelce romance when wagering.\nJoshua Grubbs, an associate professor in the University of New Mexico’s department of psychology who has researched sports betting behaviors, says over email that sportsbooks “are absolutely trying to convert a group of people who are not betting into bettors.” But whether a Swift-based strategy differs from the industry’s usual marketing is less clear. “I don't know that having Taylor Swift prop bets is any more pernicious than any other set of prop bets, free bet promos, or other gimmicks they offer,” he says.\nFor Grubbs, it’s instead a broader question of the appropriateness of gambling advertising, an unsettled debate which includes whether sportsbooks should be promoted on television or allowed to sponsor sports teams.\n“At the end of the day, we’re content creators,” says Cooper of BetOnline.ag, noting that the more “click-baity” the content, the better. “When we see a storyline or something that’s trending, we’re going to lean into that and try to distribute to a broader audience.”\nThe industry representatives I spoke with were hopeful about a turnaround should Swift get engaged or have a child with Kelce. “If Taylor Swift ever did a Super Bowl halftime show and the Chiefs were in it, that would break the entire world, internet, everything,” Cooper says.",

    "content_text": "On January 20, DeepSeek, a relatively unknown AI research lab from China, released an open source model that’s quickly become the talk of the town in Silicon Valley. According to a paper authored by the company, DeepSeek-R1 beats the industry’s leading models like OpenAI o1 on several math and reasoning benchmarks. In fact, on many metrics that matter—capability, cost, openness—DeepSeek is giving Western AI giants a run for their money.\nDeepSeek’s success points to an unintended outcome of the tech cold war between the US and China. US export controls have severely curtailed the ability of Chinese tech firms to compete on AI in the Western way—that is, infinitely scaling up by buying more chips and training for a longer period of time. As a result, most Chinese companies have focused on downstream applications rather than building their own models. But with its latest release, DeepSeek proves that there’s another way to win: by revamping the foundational structure of AI models and using limited resources more efficiently.\n“Unlike many Chinese AI firms that rely heavily on access to advanced hardware, DeepSeek has focused on maximizing software-driven resource optimization,” explains Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, who studies Chinese innovations. “DeepSeek has embraced open source methods, pooling collective expertise and fostering collaborative innovation. This approach not only mitigates resource constraints but also accelerates the development of cutting-edge technologies, setting DeepSeek apart from more insular competitors.”\nSo who is behind the AI startup? And why are they suddenly releasing an industry-leading model and giving it away for free? WIRED talked to experts on China’s AI industry and read detailed interviews with DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng to piece together the story behind the firm’s meteoric rise. DeepSeek did not respond to several inquiries sent by WIRED.\nA Star Hedge Fund in China\nEven within the Chinese AI industry, DeepSeek is an unconventional player. It started as Fire-Flyer, a deep-learning research branch of High-Flyer, one of China’s best-performing quantitative hedge funds. Founded in 2015, the hedge fund quickly rose to prominence in China, becoming the first quant hedge fund to raise over 100 billion RMB (around $15 billion). (Since 2021, the number has dipped to around $8 billion, though High-Flyer remains one of the most important quant hedge funds in the country.)\nFor years, High-Flyer had been stockpiling GPUs and building Fire-Flyer supercomputers to analyze financial data. Then, in 2023, Liang, who has a master's degree in computer science, decided to pour the fund’s resources into a new company called DeepSeek that would build its own cutting-edge models—and hopefully develop artificial general intelligence. It was as if Jane Street had decided to become an AI startup and burn its cash on scientific research.\nBold vision. But somehow, it worked. “DeepSeek represents a new generation of Chinese tech companies that prioritize long-term technological advancement over quick commercialization,” says Zhang.\nLiang told the Chinese tech publication 36Kr that the decision was driven by scientific curiosity rather than a desire to turn a profit. “I wouldn’t be able to find a commercial reason [for founding DeepSeek] even if you ask me to,” he explained. “Because it’s not worth it commercially. Basic science research has a very low return-on-investment ratio. When OpenAI’s early investors gave it money, they sure weren’t thinking about how much return they would get. Rather, it was that they really wanted to do this thing.”\nToday, DeepSeek is one of the only leading AI firms in China that doesn’t rely on funding from tech giants like Baidu, Alibaba, or ByteDance.\nA Young Group of Geniuses Eager to Prove Themselves\nAccording to Liang, when he put together DeepSeek’s research team, he was not looking for experienced engineers to build a consumer-facing product. Instead, he focused on PhD students from China’s top universities, including Peking University and Tsinghua University, who were eager to prove themselves. Many had been published in top journals and won awards at international academic conferences, but lacked industry experience, according to the Chinese tech publication QBitAI.\n“Our core technical positions are mostly filled by people who graduated this year or in the past one or two years,” Liang told 36Kr in 2023. The hiring strategy helped create a collaborative company culture where people were free to use ample computing resources to pursue unorthodox research projects. It’s a starkly different way of operating from established internet companies in China, where teams are often competing for resources. (A recent example: ByteDance accused a former intern—a prestigious academic award winner, no less—of sabotaging his colleagues’ work in order to hoard more computing resources for his team.)\nLiang said that students can be a better fit for high-investment, low-profit research. “Most people, when they are young, can devote themselves completely to a mission without utilitarian considerations,” he explained. His pitch to prospective hires is that DeepSeek was created to “solve the hardest questions in the world.”\nThe fact that these young researchers are almost entirely educated in China adds to their drive, experts say. “This younger generation also embodies a sense of patriotism, particularly as they navigate US restrictions and choke points in critical hardware and software technologies,” explains Zhang. “Their determination to overcome these barriers reflects not only personal ambition but also a broader commitment to advancing China’s position as a global innovation leader.”\nInnovation Born out of a Crisis\nIn October 2022, the US government started putting together export controls that severely restricted Chinese AI companies from accessing cutting-edge chips like Nvidia’s H100. The move presented a problem for DeepSeek. The firm had started out with a stockpile of 10,000 A100’s, but it needed more to compete with firms like OpenAI and Meta. “The problem we are facing has never been funding, but the export control on advanced chips,” Liang told 36Kr in a second interview in 2024.\nDeepSeek had to come up with more efficient methods to train its models. “They optimized their model architecture using a battery of engineering tricks—custom communication schemes between chips, reducing the size of fields to save memory, and innovative use of the mix-of-models approach,” says Wendy Chang, a software engineer turned policy analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. “Many of these approaches aren’t new ideas, but combining them successfully to produce a cutting-edge model is a remarkable feat.”\nDeepSeek has also made significant progress on Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts, two technical designs that make DeepSeek models more cost-effective by requiring fewer computing resources to train. In fact, DeepSeek's latest model is so efficient that it required one-tenth the computing power of Meta's comparable Llama 3.1 model to train, according to the research institution Epoch AI.\nDeepSeek’s willingness to share these innovations with the public has earned it considerable goodwill within the global AI research community. For many Chinese AI companies, developing open source models is the only way to play catch-up with their Western counterparts, because it attracts more users and contributors, which in turn help the models grow. “They’ve now demonstrated that cutting-edge models can be built using less, though still a lot of, money and that the current norms of model-building leave plenty of room for optimization,” Chang says. “We are sure to see a lot more attempts in this direction going forward.”\nThe news could spell trouble for the current US export controls that focus on creating computing resource bottlenecks. “Existing estimates of how much AI computing power China has, and what they can achieve with it, could be upended,” Chang says.\nCorrection 1/27/24 2:08pm ET: An earlier version of this story said DeepSeek has reportedly has a stockpile of 10,000 H100 Nvidia chips. It has been updated to clarify the stockpile is believed to be A100 chips.",

Well, for one thing, your cholesterol levels could reach such stratospheric levels that lipids start oozing from your blood vessels, forming yellowish nodules on your skin.\nThat was the disturbing case of a man in Florida who showed up at a Tampa hospital with a three-week history of painless, yellow eruptions on the palms of his hands, soles of his feet, and elbows. His case was published today in JAMA Cardiology.\nThe man, said to be in his forties, told doctors that he had adopted a “carnivore diet” eight months prior.

    "content_text": "As one of his first acts after being sworn in, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the Department of Government Efficiency by reorganizing and renaming an existing entity, the US Digital Services (USDS), as the US DOGE Service. And while some have noted that this version of DOGE moves away from the sweeping vision of deregulation outlined in a November Wall Street Journal op-ed, it's a move that will give centibillionaire Elon Musk and his allies seemingly unprecedented insight across the government and access to troves of federal data.\n“It’s quite a clever way of integrating DOGE into the federal government that I think will work, in the sense of giving it a platform for surveillance and recommendations,” says Richard Pierce, a law professor at George Washington University.\nSoon after his election victory, Trump announced that he would form DOGE, led by Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, to provide “advice and guidance from outside the government”—something that would generally require it be formed as a federal advisory committee. The idea was that DOGE would provide recommendations for how to cut some $2 trillion from the federal budget. (Shortly before Trump’s inauguration, Ramaswamy exited the DOGE project.)\nBoth Ramaswamy and Musk supported Trump during his campaign, but Musk emerged as one of the president’s most important financial backers, donating close to $200 million to the Trump-supporting America PAC. Additionally, he used the power of his own celebrity to drum up support for Trump both online and off, joining the president on the campaign trail and amplifying Trump's messaging on X, the social media platform he owns. Almost immediately after the election, Musk began to take a central role in the transition, joining Trump on calls with foreign leaders and making staffing recommendations.\nMeanwhile, Musk put out a call for people to work with DOGE onlin, and turned the Washington, DC office of his company SpaceX into a staging ground for the entity while bringing in other major figures from Silicon Valley to assist in the effort. Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen apparently joined the effort as a self-proclaimed “unpaid intern.”\nBut under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, committees of the sort DOGE seemed to be shaping up to be have several legal requirements, including making all meetings publicly accessible and requiring a diversity of perspectives on the committee itself. By repurposing the USDS, which was already part of the Office of Management and Budget, Trump managed to skirt both the requirements of a formal advisory committee and the congressional oversight required when creating a new federal agency. In short, it meant DOGE would get more access to sensitive data than an advisory committee would likely have, while offering less transparency.\nThe USDS was created by former president Barack Obama to untangle dysfunctional or failing technology across the federal government in the wake of the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. The Service’s mandate allows it the wide-ranging ability to enter any government agency and access its software or technical systems with the goal of helping to streamline or reform existing systems.\nUnder the executive order, DOGE teams, which “will typically include one DOGE Team Lead, one engineer, one human resources specialist, and one attorney” will be dispatched to various agencies. They will be granted “access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems,” ostensibly with the goal of streamlining data sharing across federal agencies.\nA former USDS employee who spoke to WIRED who was granted anonymity to preserve their privacy called the repurposing of the Digital Service an “A+ bureaucratic jiujitsu move.” But, they say, they’re concerned that DOGE’s access to sensitive information could be used to do more than just streamline government operations.\n“Is this technical talent going to be pointed toward using data from the federal government to track down opponents?” they ask. “To track down particular populations of interest to this administration for the purposes of either targeting them or singling them out or whatever it might end up being?”\nAre you a current or former employee with the US Digital Services or another government agency impacted by DOGE? We’d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Vittoria Elliott at vittoria_elliott@wired.com or securely at velliott88.18 on Signal.\nIt appears, however, that the first order of DOGE is to weed out people in agencies that might push back on the Trump administration’s agenda, starting with existing USDS staff, and hire new people.\n“DOGE teams have a lawyer, an HR director, and an engineer. If you were looking to identify functions to cut, people to cut, having an HR director there and having a lawyer say ‘here's what we're allowed to do or not do’ would be one way that you would facilitate that,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, noting that DOGE’s potential access to federal employee data could put “them in some sort of crosshairs to be fired.”\nWhen Musk took over Twitter, he brought in outside help from his close circle as well as his other companies to transform the company, a move he appears to be repeating.\nWho exactly is going to be part of DOGE is a particularly thorny issue, because there are technically two DOGEs. One is the permanent organization, the revamped USDS—now the US DOGE Service. The other is a temporary organization, with a termination date of July 4, 2026. Creating this organization means the temporary DOGE can operate under a special set of rules. It can sequester employees from other parts of the government and can accept people who want to work for the government as volunteers. Temporary organizations can also hire what are known as special government employees—experts in a given field who can bypass the rigors of the regular federal hiring processes. They’re also not subject to the same transparency requirements as other government employees.\nIn the best-case scenario, this would allow DOGE to move quickly to address issues and fast-track necessary talent, as well as build systems that make government services more seamless by facilitating the flow of information and data. But in the worst case, this could mean less transparency around the interests of people working on important government projects, while enabling possible surveillance.\n“I think part of the reason they're wanting to use special government employees is because so long as they all work less than 60 days, the financial reporting requirements are less, which is going to be attractive to billionaires who have a lot of financial things they don't want to disclose,” says Nick Bednar, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Law. “And with agency approval, these individuals are allowed to continue contracting with the federal government if they represent, say, a corporation that has a lot of contracts with the government.”\nMusk alone has over received billions of dollars via contracts with the federal government through his company SpaceX.\n“To me, [the temporary organization] suggests there's some sort of, there's some reason for that which probably has to do with skirting disclosure and conflicts of interest requirements,” claims Moynihan.\nNoah Kunin, former infrastructure director at the US General Services Administration, tells WIRED that “the government has access to incredible amounts of sensitive or proprietary business information that [businesses] had to share with the government in order to get a contract or take some action.” And while not everyone gets to access this—it generally requires some form of clearance, and government employees are not supposed to share it—this kind of information could be particularly useful to someone like Musk or other members of the business community who might be brought into DOGE.\n“You always have concerns whenever you have private sector individuals entering government for a temporary position,” says Bednar. “This is how regulatory capture occurs.”\nEven with all these special maneuvers, DOGE will likely still face hurdles. Sharing data across government departments and systems is tricky, particularly when different laws govern different agencies and the information they collect. Similarly, sensitive data often requires some form of government authorization, which DOGE volunteers and employees might not be able to get.\n“There are legal restrictions to sharing data between organizations, and those agreements take an enormous amount of effort to put into place,” the former USDS employee says. “There are tons of examples of obstacles to information sharing like that. So maybe this is more aspirational than it is possible.”\n“DOGE has just sort of added this element of unpredictability to what happens next in government,” says Moynihan. “It could be a bipartisan effort to make government technology work better. It could be an oligarch extracting resources from the government. We just really don't know. We're all gazing at tea leaves right now.”\nUpdated 1/24/2024, 12:26 pm EST: This story has been updated to reflect the reasons why a source was granted anonymity.",

    "content_text": "Just before the presidential election last November, Carolyn Fisher was in her living room in Birmingham, Alabama, when her nonbinary child walked in and said that he, along with four other transgender kids, were planning on dying by suicide if Donald Trump won the upcoming election.\nFisher and her husband were both lifelong Republicans and supporters of Trump. Holding a spiral notebook, Carolyn’s 16-year-old, who uses the pronouns he and they, made a case against voting for Trump.\n“He laid out why a vote for Donald Trump was voting against him as our child and why Donald Trump should never be president. He had literally been keeping notes of everything Trump and other Republicans had been saying about trans and nonbinary people, how they were mentally delusional and mentally ill. When he laid all of that out, my husband and I, we both just looked at each other and started crying.”\nFisher, together with members of the Rainbow Youth Project, contacted the parents of the other children who were part of the pact.\nThe Fishers later voted for then-vice president Kamala Harris, even going so far as taking a picture of their ballot to show their child.\nBut Trump still won, and during the president’s inauguration speech on January 20, the Fishers heard him say that their child effectively doesn’t exist when he signed a sweeping executive order that, among other things, calls for the ending of trans care, requires housing trans women in male prisons, and allows only male or female markers on official documents like passports and not the “X” that was introduced in 2021 for people who identify as nonbinary, intersex, or gender nonconforming.\n“As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,” Trump said.\nWhen a bishop at the National Cathedral service for the inauguration this week asked Trump to protect “gay, lesbian, and transgender children” the president dismissed her pleas in a Truth Social post and called her “nasty in tone, and not compelling or smart.”\nThe executive order contains provisions that require further federal action to become law, and this document should be viewed as a roadmap the Trump administration has drafted to signal what new rules they are planning on implementing. But experts say the order published this week, in conjunction with Trump’s very public comments, are designed to strike fear into the trans community.\n“I think there's a huge amount of it that is just about fear, and a part of it is trying to scare people into compliance” Allison Chapman, a trans rights activist, tells WIRED. “Enforcement takes a lot of time, energy, and resources, so what we really need people to do is to not voluntarily comply in advance. There needs to be an active resistance to these things.”\nThe Rainbow Youth Project, an organization focused on helping young LGBTQ+ people, received over 6,000 calls in just the first couple of days after Trump’s November election win. That’s up from the usual 3,600 calls a month. It didn’t stop: The hotline received over 8,000 calls in December.\nNow, after Trump’s comment and actions on the first day of his presidency, the group’s crisis helpline is once again receiving a torrent of calls. Sixty-two percent of incoming calls this week, the group tells WIRED, are from trans and gender-nonconforming adolescents age 14 to 17.\nThe callers are expressing varying degrees of emotional and mental distress, often expressing feelings of hopelessness and fear. One of the most common sentiments shared is “my country does not want me to exist.”\nWhile the Trump administration’s actions are causing huge distress for the trans community and their families, a stark increase in the attacks, both online and offline, are already coming from Trump supporters who feel emboldened.\n“We have already seen an uptick in the hate against us,” Fisher says. “We had someone who came to our home just last Tuesday and put a note in our mailbox that said: ‘He's your daddy now, he's your president. You people won't exist anymore.’ So yes, they're definitely emboldened.”\nA trans pride flag they had hanging on their porch has been stolen twice in the space of a week. At her local Piggly Wiggly, a supermarket, she overheard people at an adjacent table talking about how glad they were that Trump had “gotten rid of” trans people.\n“He didn’t get rid of them, they’re always going to exist—but he damn so put a target on them, especially my teenage son,” Fisher said.\nAnd the attacks are also targeting the groups who are trying to help the LGBTQ+ community.\n“We have seen a lot more hate,” Lance Preston, executive director of the Rainbow Youth Project, tells WIRED. “We've been receiving a lot of messages, crazy shit, like ‘Trump is your president, now all of you are gonna have to go away. We don't want you here.’ We get those in contact submission forms every day, and since the election it has just grown exponentially. It's really sad.”\nSome activists are also concerned that those who have always stood with the LGBTQ+ community could be too scared to speak up under Trump’s new administration.\n“Every time something like this happens we notice supporters backing down and just getting quiet,” Chris Sederburg, who helps trans and gender nonconforming people through the Rainbow Youth Project, tells WIRED. “Not all of them, but a lot of them do because they're scared of what's happening. They're scared of what might happen to them or they might catch hate for it.”\nSederburg, a trans man who works as a trucker, communicates with young trans people on social media and says that the response this week from the community has been one of “intense, immediate fear.”\nFor Jamie Anderson, a 40-year-old teacher living in Texas, her biggest fear is that Trump’s administration forces her 15-year-old daughter Dawn, who came out as trans last year, to make a traumatic decision.\n“My biggest worry is that she's going to have to go back to living a lie, like not being who she is meant to be,” says Anderson. “She's happy now, she's a lot happier than she was right before she came out. She was super depressed. We had no idea what was going on. And finally she comes out, and she's this whole brand-new, amazing, loving child.”\nBut that’s not Dawn’s biggest fear. When WIRED asked what that would be, Dawn remained silent. Moments after the interview, Dawn sent a message: “I am afraid the government will take me away and end up killing me because I am transgender,” adding that she was now willing to share this in case “it might help others understand what I’m going through.”\n(Jamie and Dawn are not the women’s real names. WIRED is using pseudonyms to protect their identities.)\nThe Fishers, meanwhile, are considering moving to a different state, possibly to California, where they feel their child would be more protected. But Carolyn Fisher worries about other families and trans and nonbinary children who may not have that option.\n“I just want these kids to know that there are people out there, even Republicans, even conservative Christians, who love them and accept them for the way they are, and we want them to stay here with us,” Fisher says.\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for free, 24-hour support from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

    "content_text": "All the tech we rely on, from cars to smartphones, was engineered using physics. You don’t need to know the science to use these things. But a well-rounded human should understand at least some of the key concepts—along with some music, art, history, and economics. Robert Heinlein said it all in Time Enough for Love:\n“A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.”\nSo, in the interest of not being insects, here are my top-five physics equations you should know.\nI’m sure you've seen this one before—it’s over 300 years old, and it's popular for science memes and T-shirts. It says the net force on an object equals its mass (m) times acceleration (a). But what does that really mean? It's all about interactions—like when you kick a soccer ball or drop a water bottle on the floor.\nNewton's second law says we can describe these interactions with the concept of “force.” And what do forces do? The net force on an object changes the object’s motion. But wait! There's a bunch more cool stuff in this simple-looking equation.\nSee those arrows over F and a? That indicates variables that are vectors, meaning they contain more than one piece of information. For example, if someone asks you to “socially distance” yourself by 1 meter, where would you end up? Who knows? You could go 1 meter to the east or west or 39 degrees from north. The distance by itself isn't the full story; you also need to specify a direction. This is true for both the forces and the acceleration. Other quantities (like mass or temperature) don't have direction. We call those scalar values.\nNewton’s second law is super useful, but weirdly, people don’t seem to believe it. The common misconception is that a constant force makes an object move at a constant speed. What this equation says, rather, is that if you push on an object with a steady force, it will keep accelerating.\nWhy do people get this wrong? It’s because you almost never have just one force acting on an object. If you kept a steady pressure on your car’s gas pedal, and that was the only force on the car, believe me, you’d keep going faster and faster. But in reality, there’s wind drag pushing in the opposite direction, which partially offsets the force from your engine.\nBy using forces to describe interactions, we can do a bunch of awesome things—like model the motion of a basketball in the air, an accelerating drag racer, or even the motion of a binary star system.\nIf you take a long string and shake one end, you will create a disturbance. Guess what, with that simple shake you've made a wave pulse, which travels along the string. It's pretty cool and very easy to do. I’m in Louisiana, so naturally I used a string of Mardi Gras beads.\nDon’t let this one scare you—it’s a differential equation, which is calculus. But the idea is simple. If you picture a coordinate plane with a string laid out on the x-axis, it says the position of the string in the vertical (y) direction depends on both time (t) and the location of that part of the string (x).\nUsing this, we can model a pulse on a string to show that it moves with a velocity v. For actual real strings, this wave velocity depends on both the mass per length as well as the string tension. Here's a fun example of a wave on a massive string in case you want to see some more math.\nWhy should you care? Well, it turns out that waves are all around us. Light is an electromagnetic wave. Same for the radiation in your microwave oven and your Wi-Fi signal. Sound is a pressure wave in the air. You can also pluck a string with both ends fixed, causing the wave to bounce back and forth—this is called a “standing wave,” and it’s how people play guitar. Kind of a big deal.\nAs you will see shortly, we can even describe the behavior of super tiny things like electrons with a wave-ish equation.\nHeh. I’m cheating a little by including four equations as just one, but it’s a package deal. Maxwell's equations basically describe everything you need to know about the electric field (E) and the magnetic field (B) and how they’re related. The electric field is a way to describe interactions with electric charges (like electrons and protons), and the magnetic field describes what happens when those charges are moving (either in an atom or in an electric current).\nPretty much everything around you has something to do with the electric-magnetic interaction. When you push on a wall, why doesn’t your hand pass through it? After all, the wall is not a solid object, it’s made up of discrete atoms. It’s because of an electric interaction between the electrons in your hand and those in the wall, which repel each other. Then of course there are things like light bulbs, electric motors—oh, and computers.\nWait! There's something even more important about Maxwell's equations. You can use these to show that an oscillating electric field creates a changing magnetic field, and this changing magnetic field creates an electric field. Essentially, you can make a wave (with the wave equation) for electric and magnetic fields in the same way that a wave moves on a string. The speed of this electromagnetic wave (in a vacuum) would be 2.99 x 108 meters per second—which just happens to be the speed of light. So, light is indeed an electromagnetic wave. That's kind of a big deal.\nSchrödinger’s equation is the mathematical model at the heart of quantum mechanics. Although we can use Newton's second law to understand the behavior of a baseball or the moon orbiting the Earth, this doesn't work when we get to super small things like electrons and protons. It turns out that many of our ideas about motion just don’t work at the subatomic scale. Richard Feynman once said, “If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics.”\nThat said, let's take a quick look at the Schrödinger equation. The version above is called the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in one dimension. See the variable Ψ (psi)? This is called the wave function. It's a way to represent the probable location of a particle, since we can't actually calculate the trajectory. We call it a wave function because it has a wavelike solution—which is nice, since we can then use our math techniques for dealing with waves.\nNotice that this equation relates a time rate of change (on the left) and a space rate of change (on the right)—like the wave equation we explored earlier. It might seem weird that this includes an imaginary number (i is the square root of –1), but these often pop up in physics models—they’re quite useful to represent oscillations.\nLet's look at another awesome part of this equation: ℏ. This is called the reduced Planck constant, and it gives a relationship between energy and frequency at the quantum level. (For kicks, you can measure this fundamental constant using different colored LEDs.)\nNow, if you’re all in on quantum, and you want to tattoo Schrödinger's equation on your arm, I’d suggest using this shorter version:\nIt’s basically the same thing. You still have the dependence on time on the left. The space part is replaced with the Hamiltonian operator (an H wearing a hat). Finally, |Ψ> is called a state vector. It's just a different way to represent the wave function Ψ.\nOK, but why should you care about the quantum realm? Well, even though you can’t go there like Ant-Man, we often deal with things at the atomic level. Just think about a single water molecule. It's an interaction between one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. Even this simple molecule is very complicated, but it can be modeled using Schrödinger's equation. If you don't like water (you should), there's a whole range of technologies based on quantum mechanics: lasers, atomic clocks, LEDs, and of course semiconductors (used in the computer you’re reading this on).\nIf you ask any random person to give you a physics equation, there's a good chance you’ll get this one. In short, it shows a relationship between energy (E) and mass (m) with the constant c for the speed of light (2.99 x 108 meters per second) But wait! Although this version is what everybody knows, a more complete version looks like this:\nThis takes the particle's velocity (v) into account, so we can get an expression for the total energy of a particle. If the velocity is much lower than the speed of light, then the energy is approximately:\nThat 1/2mv2 might look familiar. It’s the kinetic energy of an object. So, we can say that the energy of something is the sum of its “rest mass energy” (mc2) and its kinetic energy.\nIt's crazy though. If you throw a baseball, it obviously has kinetic energy because it's moving. But Einstein’s equation says it also has energy when it’s stationary. Let’s look at some actual values. Suppose a baseball (mass of 0.149 kilograms) is moving with a speed of 40 meters per second (a professional pitcher speed). The ball would have a kinetic energy of 119 joules, but the rest mass energy would 1.33 x 1018 joules. You can tell that's big, right? But you have no idea.\nIn 2022 the US used 4.07 trillion kilowatt-hours of energy. If you convert that value, you get 1.46 x 1019 joules. So, if you were able to take 11 baseballs and convert all of their mass into electrical energy, it would be enough to run the US for a year.\nThis is exactly what happens in a nuclear power plant. Large-mass elements (like uranium) are hit with neutrons so that they break into pieces. However, the total mass of all the parts that it breaks into is less than the original uranium mass. The lost mass is converted to energy. Since the c term in the equation is squared, a little bit of mass gives a lot of energy.\nOh, maybe you don't like nuclear power plants. Fine. Do you like other types of energy? Do you like to eat? Do you like weather? All of these things depend on this large object in the sky called the sun. Yes, the sun produces light from a nuclear reaction in its core. This light is the source of most other forms of energy production. It helps plants grow (you can eat those), and animals eat those plants (you can also eat the animals). This solar energy heats the surface of the Earth to produce changes in temperature and weather. The sun is kind of a big deal.\nSo, perhaps E = mc2 may be the most famous physics equation, but it’s also the most important. I do like to eat stuff.\nDo you use these equations in your everyday life? Do you have a favorite formula not listed above? Tell us in the comments below.",

    "content_text": "Slowly but surely, we are making good on the gadgets we imagined, as kids, that the future would hold. Penny Brown’s video watch from Inspector Gadget? Check. The Starfleet tricorder from Star Trek? Almost there. But web-shooting? Web-slinging? That wasn't one we really thought would make the crossover. And it wasn't exactly in the plans for the scientist who has made the strong, sticky, air-spun web a reality either, Marco Lo Presti, from Tufts University’s Silklab.\nBack in 2020, Lo Presti, a research assistant professor in biomedical engineering, was working on the challenge of underwater adhesives. The first material he chose to work on was made up of silk and dopamine, a popular combination because it mimics the way that mussels stick firmly to rock surfaces in water—something that has been useful in other applications.\n“While using acetone to clean the glassware of this silk and dopamine substance,” he says, “I noticed it was undergoing a transition into a solid format, into a web-looking material, into something that looked like a fiber. I showed the vials to Fio, and we immediately started thinking about how we could make a remote adhesive [a substance that sticks to an object from a distance] out of it.”\nFio is Fiorenzo Omenetto, professor of engineering at Tufts and “puppeteer” of the Silklab. “We'd like to say that every experiment is painstakingly planned with equations and lots of forethought, but it's really about connection,” he says. “You explore and you play and you sort of connect the dots. Part of the play that is very underestimated is where you say ‘hey, wait a second, is this like a Spider-Man thing?’ And you brush it off at first, but a material that mimics superpowers is always a very, very good thing.”\nBefore Lo Presti could turn his attention to these accidental webs, though, he had to complete his paper on underwater adhesives using biomolecules, which he did in 2021. A lot of the Silklab’s work is “bio-inspired” by spiders and silkworms, mussels and barnacles, velvet worm slime, even tropical orchids—so working out whether this sticky web could become something useful might seem like an easy side-step for the team.\nHowever, Lo Presti points out that while the new material does mimic spider threads, “there is no spider able to eject, to shoot a stream of solution, which turns into a fiber and does the remote capturing of a distant object.” This was something new, for the real world at least.\nBut as the research paper in Advanced Functional Materials notes—enter fictional characters. In Stan Lee and Steve Ditko’s original 1960s comic books, starting with Amazing Fantasy #15, Peter Parker builds a “little device,” one fastened to each wrist and triggered by finger pressure, to produce strands of ejectable ‘spider webs.’ By the time of the mid-2000s Sam Raimi Spider-Man films, the web-shooting switched from a wrist-worn spinneret gadget to an organic part of his superhero transformation.\nFrom Science Fiction Into Reality\nAt the real-life lab in Medford, Massachusetts, the true web-slinging evolution began when Lo Presti and his colleagues shot a thin stream of their silk fibroin (Japanese silk moth cocoons, boiled down and broken into proteins) and dopamine combination through a needle. This was originally ejected straight into a “bath” of acetone, which triggers the substance's solidification into a hydrogel.\nThe team then decided to add this all-important acetone into the outer layer of a coaxial needle, surrounding the silk and dopamine in the inner needle layer to enable the liquid to shoot straight into the air. As the acetone evaporates mid-air, the dopamine speeds up the substance's solidifying process, creating sticky, strong, spun fibers by pulling water away from the silk—something that would usually take hours.\nWith the obvious pop culture inspiration in mind, this was a place the team worked hard to get to. “We were looking at doing something in air,” Lo Presti says, “so adapting and creating the engineering device, the study of the flow, the coaxial needle, to have the fiber ejected in the air—that was where we started to get truly excited.”\nThe team started to experiment with its strength, shooting fibers to capture and lift objects including a cocoon, a 2-gram stainless-steel bolt and a 5-gram wood block from 12 centimeters away. Bit by bit, they fine-tuned their solution with additional materials to change what it was capable of: a biopolymer named chitosan to give the fibers up to 200 times more tensile strength and a borate buffer to increase the adhesiveness to objects by 18 times.\n“We can now catch an object up to 30 or 35 centimeters away and lift an object of around 15 to 20 grams,” says Lo Presti. The silk fibers performed the best on cardboard and wood, both instantly and after 10 minutes, but also work on materials like plastic, glass, and metal. Testing real-world conditions, the researchers used the air-spun fibers to remotely pick up a small plastic lab tube floating on water, and a stainless-steel scalpel, partially buried in sand.\nSo, Spider-Man capabilities when? “Everybody wants to know if we're going to be able to swing from buildings,” says Omenetto with a wry smile. But we're not there yet—so far the Silklab team itself has speculated about some potential uses for the material: the retrieval of an object that’s lost underwater, perhaps, or a drone that captures something in a remote environment.\n“In principle, if you have the starting material and if you can control the parameters, the baseline material properties are such that you could do amazing things,” Omenetto explains. “I mean you could probably lift a very heavy object, but that’s one of the big questions—what can you lift? Can you remotely drag something? Silk is very, very strong, it’s very tough, it can lift incredible weights but this is silk in its natural form whether it’s from the spider or the silkworm. There is not a fundamental limit in these directions.”\nLo Presti is interested to hear from anyone who has read his paper and thinks they might be in need of a web-shooting silk fiber. A few months after he published his work on the underwater adhesive, a nonprofit emailed to ask if it could be used to tag sharks. “My first answer was absolutely not,” he says, “because the adhesive is too rigid and because sharks move. But I then tried to make something, and we’re still collaborating with them and working on this.”\nIt’s not unlikely, Lo Presti suggests, that the same could happen with this project and that the speed, distance, and strength of the object-capturing fibers could also be improved with more dedicated work from the team. These first “small” examples are to demonstrate the possibilities of the material, but improving and tailoring it for specific applications may be the key to uncovering its true potential.",

    "content_text": "Mere moments after his swearing in Monday, President Donald Trump made a proclamation to attendees of his inauguration: “It shall henceforth be the policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.” Trump then signed an executive order disparaging what the White House called “gender ideology” and claiming that a person’s sex is “not changeable and [is] grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.”\nTrump’s order, which was widely seen as an unscientific attempt to roll back the rights of transgender and gender-expansive people, also instructs federal agencies “to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder’s sex,” rather than their gender identity. It was one of 78 orders signed on Monday, some of which were part of Trump’s attempts to end Biden-era policies that “socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.”\nWhile the executive order only affects federal policy, the broader implications are vast. It’s only been a decade since Facebook’s “real name” policy made it hard for people to hold accounts under names different than the ones on their IDs. Facebook has since amended these guidelines, but as companies like Meta clear the way for users to claim trans people have “mental illness,” digital safe spaces for LGBTQ+ people seem to be dwindling. Except in one arena: dating apps.\nFollowing Trump’s executive order, Match Group and Feeld both told WIRED they have no intention of reversing course when it comes to the gender identity options offered on their respective platforms.\n“We are not making changes to our apps,” says a spokesperson for Match Group, which owns OkCupid, Tinder, Hinge, and several other dating platforms.\nIt remains to be seen how other tech companies will respond to the executive order. Some, like Meta, seemed to be making overtures to the incoming Trump administration before this week. Earlier this month, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company would end its third-party fact-checking program and transition to a Community Notes model, à la X.\nZuckerberg peddled the sudden reversal as a bid to scale up free speech across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads and allow for more political content. “We’re going to simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse,” Zuckerberg said in a video accompanying the announcement.\nShould online life become even less inclusive for LGBTQ+ people during Trump’s term, apps like OkCupid, Feeld, and Hinge could become digital havens, places to connect. “In a time when many of our civil rights are under threat, dating apps have the ability to serve as crucial spaces for gender, racial, and sexual inclusivity,” says Apryl Williams, a professor of communication and digital studies at the University of Michigan.\nOver a decade ago, in 2014, OkCupid expanded its gender options for users to include identifications such as transgender, pangender, intersex, agender, and genderqueer. It was among the first dating apps to capture an accurate picture of identity online, and the different ways it was evolving. Currently, Tinder provides an option for “beyond binary” and Hinge allows users to select “nonbinary” on their profiles.\nBumble, which offers 19 gender options for singles, declined to comment on this story.\nFeeld is also doubling down on user protections under the Trump administration, CEO Ana Kirova tells WIRED. As societal norms continue to evolve, Kirova wants the app to be a sanctuary for safety and authenticity. “We remain dedicated to nurturing an environment where everyone can be and express themselves authentically, respectfully, and without fear of discrimination, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation,” she says.\nThis week the Trump administration also began scrubbing the internet of gender identity websites, including the “Change sex identification” page on the Social Security Administration website and the Department of Labor’s page for reporting sexual and gender-based discrimination.\nIn spite of Gen Z ditching dating apps in favor of IRL hookups, user growth on Feeld has increased 30 percent year-over-year since 2022. In fact, 2024 was a record year for Big Dating, as waves of new users joined despite reports of app fatigue. As more people consider what brings them pleasure and happiness, or simply question the outdated constraints of sexual constructs, Kirova says that Feeld recognizes the inherent fluidity in its members.

    "content_text": "Donald Trump’s executive order designating cartels as terrorist organizations could give his administration greater power to impose economic sanctions, restrict travel, and potentially take military action abroad. On Monday, when signing the executive order in the Oval Office, Trump said that “Mexico probably won't be happy.” But this proposal is not new—in his first term as president, Trump tried to impose this designation but was eventually dissuaded by Mexican authorities, who pledged to cooperate with the United States to combat cartels.\nThe idea of designating cartels as terrorists is decades old. \"This began to be discussed in the 1980s, during Ronald Reagan's administration, when drug trafficking began to be associated with the threat to national security. Since then, both Democrats and Republicans have promoted the concept of 'narcoterrorism,'\" says Oswaldo Zavala, author of Drug Cartels Do Not Exist: Narcotrafficking in US and Mexican Culture.\nNow, the government of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has maintained that the bilateral relationship should be based on cooperation and not subordination, is obliged to treat the issue of migration and drug trafficking with caution. “Our relationship with the United States will be one of equals,” said Sheinbaum. She said she expects a dialog between the two countries to take place soon. \"We will enter into communication and we know that there will be an agreement on different issues … reaching agreements on migration issues, recognition of the work of Mexicans in the United States, drug trafficking, weapons that cross from the United States to Mexico, cultural issues and, of course, trade issues. Always as equals,\" said the president.\nMexico is one of the largest trading partners of the United States. Fracturing the relationship could have economic repercussions, including millions of US jobs.\nIn the order issued Monday, Trump specifically mentioned two criminal groups operating within the United States: the Venezuelan-born Aragua Train and the Salvadoran-born MS-13. Using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, his administration could implement additional measures to dismantle the financial networks of these organizations.\nThe narrative of US government extortion of the Mexican government has come from both Democrats and Republicans. One proponent of this idea was Hillary Clinton. “Clinton represented an interventionist stance. This approach is characterized by a hostile and militaristic view towards Latin America. In this context, Donald Trump appears to be continuing, in a more aggressive way, the already violent anti-drug policy of the United States. Over the decades, this policy has become progressively more violent and hostile. In the 1940s, military actions focused on eradicating crops such as marijuana and opium. However, in the 1980s, a more systematic fight against alleged criminal organizations began, and by the 1990s, a closer collaboration between the army and the police was consolidated, which led to an increasing militarization of public life in Mexico,\" says Zavala, who also holds a PhD in philosophy. “My concern is that the concept of narcoterrorism amplifies the power of pressure, blackmail and, ultimately, this notion could inaugurate a new era of political violence justified by this discourse,” he adds.\nCartels Could Turn Into Real Terrorist Organizations\nSupporters of the designation often point to violence against Americans as justification. But military action against the cartels could lead to more organized attacks against Americans, even within the United States. \"Drug cartels could easily become full-blown terrorist organizations,\" said Brian Michael Jenkins, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corporation.\nTrump's executive order could be turned against the United States. And the difference is that we have stopped talking about marijuana and heroin, gradually shifting to synthetic drugs, with fentanyl being the most serious public health case in recent times, with 70,000 people dying from the synthetic opioid in 2023.\n“The problem with fentanyl is its ease of trafficking: It has no smell, comes in small pills, and is extremely discreet. In addition, most of those who traffic fentanyl are Americans, as are most of the users. This creates a paradox typical of drug policy. While there is talk of Mexican narco-terrorists, studies conducted in the United States show that the main perpetrators of fentanyl trafficking and consumption are Americans,” Zavala says.\nThis raises fundamental questions. \"If they are going to designate traffickers as narco-terrorists, will they also include the Americans who are part of these networks? Because we are not just talking about the famous drug cartels, but also trafficking networks, money laundering, arms smuggling and other structures, many of which are incorporated in the United States. There is an enormous complexity in defining where a cartel begins and where it ends. There is a dispersion of actors, organizations and relationships on both sides of the border involved in drug trafficking. Therefore, to speak of narcoterrorism is to speak of something vague and imprecise. This term is not supported by concrete evidence; rather, its use is eminently political,\" argues Zavala.\nAccording to Zavala, the narrative allows figures like President Trump to use the concept of narcoterrorism as a tool of intimidation, threat and extortion towards the Mexican government. “Rather than describing realities, narcoterrorism is based on spectral notions, on political phantoms that are used to force Mexico to align with Washington's interests,” he says.\nAn Executive Order to Intervene Militarily in Mexico\nIntervening militarily in Mexican territory with selective incursions aimed at damaging the cartels is something that has been on the US radar screen for some time now. But analysts argue that it would be a shot in the foot for the Trump administration.\n\"By using the concept of narcoterrorism, the US government empowers itself to intervene militarily in Mexico. That is something very complicated, because intervening in that way would seriously damage the binational relationship, which is very delicate. It is almost inconceivable [the idea of military aggression],\" Zavala explains. \"I believe that in addition to the bravado, the Mexican government has generally been aligned because in the end our security policy has always been subordinated and violated; even subalternized by the United States.\"\nThis Wednesday, the president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said that the secretary of foreign affairs, Juan Ramón de la Fuente, had a telephone conversation with US secretary of state Marco Rubio. She did not provide details of the conversation, but said it was \"a very cordial conversation\" and they discussed “migration and security issues.” Rubio has said that he would prefer that any action, any decision taken from Washington have the consent, the collaboration of the Mexican government.\n“Cartels Do Not Exist”\nOswaldo Zavala (Ciudad Juarez, 1975) has specialized in Mexican narrative, and has an alternative vision of the narco phenomenon in Mexico. He believes that the image of the power of the cartels is exaggerated and sponsored by the State. The author of The Imaginary U.S.—Mexico Drug Wars: State Power, Organized Crime, and the Political History of Narconarratives (1975–2012), explains to WIRED that the war against drug trafficking is generally built on fantastical, contradictory and often absurd concepts, which gradually form an imaginary that presents drug trafficking in an alarmist manner.\n\"The US government has managed with great skill to create a long list of concepts, monsters and criminal actors that not only dominate the public debate in the United States, but also in Mexico. Thus, when Americans want it, one organization or another becomes the center of discussion. In the 1980s, for example, it was the Guadalajara Cartel, with figures such as Rafael Caro Quintero and Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo. In the 1990s, the central figure was El Chapo Guzman, and later, Amado Carrillo. Today, the conversation revolves around fentanyl and, above all, the Sinaloa Cartel,\" Zavala explains.\nZavala argues that the narratives used by the US government are ways of simplifying a complex problem, giving a common sense to the debate that would otherwise be much more complicated. \"If we take into account that a large part of drug consumption occurs in the United States, that there are organizations within that country that facilitate trafficking, launder money and, in many cases, are as or more dangerous than the Mexican ones, the discussion becomes much more complex for the Mexican panorama. What these narratives do, then, is to simplify the situation, presenting Mexico as the primary enemy of US security. In doing so, the US government can intervene not only mediatically but also politically, diplomatically, and even militarily in Mexico,\" he says.\n“As citizens we must be very careful with the narratives that are generated from Washington,” he warns. \"It is essential to learn to analyze them critically and to distance ourselves from what we are being told. This process is neither easy nor quick, since, unfortunately, not only the Mexican government repeats these narratives, but the media also replicates them, and sometimes institutions and other actors push them. And, to complicate things even more, a popular culture is created that feeds these ideas: today there are already corridos about fentanyl, about the ‘Chapitos’ and about the supposed criminal empires of the cartels. It is very difficult to escape from all this.\"\nA War That Has Left More Than 100,000 People Missing\nMore than 100,000 people have been missing in Mexico since 1964, when the count began. The National Registry of Disappeared and Unaccounted for Persons has for months now exceeded this figure, which is evidence of the grave situation in the country. Most of these people were registered as missing since 2006, when the administration of Felipe Calderón, who took the army to the streets to combat the violence of organized crime, began.\n\"Many of the most serious effects of the anti-drug policy we have been suffering in Mexico for decades. More than half a million murders since the militarization began with President Calderon, more than 100,000 forced disappearances. We know that all that violence is unloaded, above all, against poor, racialized, brown young people, who live in the most disadvantaged areas of the country,\" says Zavala, who is surprised when people are alarmed by what Trump says. \"As if we weren't already living, for years now, a really serious wave of violence in the country.\"\nAccording to the researcher, military violence is often expressed as a form of social control, as a management of violence. \"You're not going to see militarization in areas like the Condesa or Roma, but in the margins of Mexico City, in the most impoverished areas. The violence is happening in the peripheries, in the poorest neighborhoods, where there is not even adequate monitoring by the media or human rights institutions,\" Zavala says.\nWhat should surprise us, Zavala says, are the very high rates of violence we are experiencing, as a background of what is already happening, not of something that is yet to come. \"I think we still don't fully understand that this violence has a clear class dimension. It is not generalized violence, but systematized and directed against the most vulnerable sectors of society,\" he says.\nThe Solution: Demilitarizing the Country\nThe decision taken by Calderón 16 years ago to entrust the Army with the responsibility of public security in several areas of the country has shown us its fatal consequences. Both Enrique Peña Nieto and Andrés Manuel López Obrador pledged, during their respective electoral campaigns, to return peace, security, and civility to us. However, once in power, both presented proposals to consolidate, through legislation and even constitutional reforms, the militarized public security model. The situation does not seem to change with Claudia Sheinbaum's administration.\nIn this way, Mexico's recent presidents have maintained a \"peace and security\" policy based on a militarized strategy, justifying it on the supposed operational incapacity of police corporations to confront organized crime.\n“I agree with the view that drugs need to be decriminalized, addictions treated, all that. But in my opinion, most of the violence in Mexico is not necessarily linked to drug trafficking, but to the experience of militarization itself. And I think there is solid empirical data to support this idea. We know that there is a ‘before’ and an ‘after’ militarization in Mexico,” Zavala explains. “Before the deployment of the army, our homicide rates were declining throughout the country, and there is a direct correlation between military occupation, the presence of the armed forces, and the increase in homicides and forced disappearances.”\nIn Zavala's opinion, the only way out of this spiral of violence in Mexico is to demilitarize the country. But it's not as simple as it might sound. Militarism is part of a global trend, and we are living in an era in which all Western democracies are becoming increasingly militarized, with effects similar to those we have experienced in Mexico.\n\"Military violence in the United States, for example, is also being discharged against minority and racialized populations, and, in addition, we have an unstoppable flow of weapons going from the global north to the global south. All of this is accompanied by extremely violent policies of control and security that in reality translate into extermination strategies and operations,\" he says. \"I don't see many ways out, because while López Obrador's government fills its mouth with speeches about sovereignty, militarism continues to advance. They continue to defend crimes against humanity committed by the army, they continue to detain and deport migrants, and they continue to use the army as a force for violence and social control. I don't believe there is any real will to dismantle the infrastructure of violence that militarization has created in Mexico.\"\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "content_text": "The wheels are already beginning to turn on Donald Trump’s plan to make the US into the “crypto capital of the planet” following his return to the White House.\nIn an executive order signed Thursday, Trump established a “working group on digital asset markets,” which will be responsible for weighing the possibility of the US forming a “strategic national digital asset stockpile,” among other things.\nThe promise to establish a stockpile was one of numerous commitments made by Trump to the crypto industry before he was reelected. Though the idea stumped economists, it received a rapturous reception among bitcoiners. As rumors of an impending announcement spread Thursday, the price of bitcoin climbed to $105,000 per coin, just short of the record high.\nThe order also requires the working group—which will comprise the leaders of various government branches, financial regulatory bodies, and the attorney general—to come up with an appropriate set of regulations and laws governing the use of crypto.\nEarlier in the week, on Trump’s second day in office, the Securities and Exchange Commission—the US regulatory body that brought a volley of lawsuits against crypto firms under the Joe Biden administration—established a “crypto task force.” Under new leadership following the departure of former chair Gary Gensler, who was widely demonized in the cryptosphere, the SEC will develop a “comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets,” the agency stated.\nLater the same day, Trump granted clemency to Ross Ulbricht, who was serving life in prison for crimes committed while running the infamous darknet marketplace Silk Road, one of the first websites to accept bitcoin as payment. After being arrested in 2013, Ulbricht became something of a martyr in crypto circles for his part in spreading the bitcoin gospel.\nThese initial gestures signal Trump’s willingness to follow through on earlier campaign promises: to pass various crypto-related legislation, reform the financial regulatory apparatus in the US, and knit crypto into the US national treasury. The effects will be extensive, crypto figures believe, reverberating far beyond US shores and creating the conditions for a new golden era for the industry.\n“Our technology is very powerful and transformative. We need to land it in different societies,” says Joseph Lubin, cofounder of Ethereum and chief executive at software company Consensys. “And America is a standard-setter for the rest of the world.”\nDespite having previously spurned bitcoin as a “scam,” Trump now has extensive ties to the crypto industry, many high-profile members of which came out in support of his reelection campaign.\nIn the lead-up to the 2024 election, crypto organizations donated hundreds of millions of dollars to crypto-focused super political action committees, which spent the funds in support of crypto-friendly congressional candidates, many of them Republican.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump began to bill himself as the first “crypto president.” In July, in front of a rabid crowd of bitcoiners, Trump promised to turn the US into a crypto mining powerhouse and establish a national bitcoin stockpile if reelected. In the same speech, he pledged to fire Gensler, the SEC chair, prompting the most rapturous applause of the night.\nIn September, apparently dissatisfied with watching from the dugout, Trump and his family helped to launch a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, which they pitched as a way to “make finance great again.”\nDays before his inauguration, on January 17, Trump even launched his own official memecoin—a highly volatile type of cryptocurrency whose price is dictated by the amount of attention it attracts—sparking a trading frenzy. Two companies with connections to Trump own 80 percent of the total supply of the coin, a trove theoretically valued in the tens of billions of dollars.\nNow that Trump has skin in the game, the crypto industry can be all the more confident of his continued support, says Demelza Hays, digital asset portfolio manager at investment firm Zeltner & Co and chief economist at the crypto trade publication CoinTelegraph. “This was definitely saying that Trump is going to support crypto, profit from crypto, and try to remove any barriers to crypto,” says Hays. “All of a sudden, we have the president coming out and saying: ‘F you, I’m launching a memecoin.’”\nAfter Trump emerged victorious in November, the crypto industry worked closely with the transition team, WIRED reported, to select a new chair for the SEC, who would be tasked with creating a regulatory framework for crypto. Trump settled on crypto advocate and former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, who awaits confirmation.\nThe priority among crypto businesses is the ability to operate in the US without the fear of legal action by the SEC, which under Gensler took the view that many crypto businesses were violating securities laws, but declined to outline rules for the industry. “We’ve been operating under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty for a really long time,” says Lubin.\nIn the absence of clear rules, “the problem is that people end up trying to read the tea leaves,” said SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, who will lead the SEC’s new crypto task force, in an interview with WIRED last year. “A good way to handle this is not to bring a bunch of enforcement cases and [ask the industry] to connect all the dots.”\nThe new set of rules will liberate crypto entrepreneurs to press the limits of the technology, claims Noelle Acheson, a market analyst formerly of crypto brokerage Genesis. “The big impact will be all the building that has been on pause because of the SEC’s approach in the last four years,” she says. “We are now in a period of accelerated change—change on steroids.”\nThe initial offerings made to the crypto industry by Trump in the early days of his presidency, says Acheson, are but “a taste of what’s coming.”",

Its first project, scheduled for release later this year, will be an as-yet-unnamed horror game from Surgent Studios, the developer behind 2024’s Tales of Kenzera: Zau.\nPalworld, jokingly referred to as “Pokémon with guns,” was a breakout success last year, drawing in more than 25 million players in its first few months. The company’s step into publishing comes at a turbulent time for video games, especially smaller studios; last year, Among Us developer Innersloth announced its own move into publishing to help push projects forward. Pocketpair’s Palworld success, it seems, is allowing it to do the same.\n“As the games industry continues to grow, more and more games find themselves struggling to get funded or greenlit,” John Buckley, head of Pocketpair Publishing, said in a press release announcing the new division. “We think this is a real shame, because there are so many incredible creators and ideas out there that just need a little help to become incredible games.\"\nIt’s no surprise, then, that Pocketpair would work with Surgent Studios, which has struggled to find funding following the release of Zau.

Unlike the Afrofuturism of Zau, it’ll be a horror title meant to introduce players to something new. “We're taking a little detour from the Tales of Kenzera universe,” Salim says.\nSalim adds that the horror genre “is a fascinating space that taps into primal emotions, immersing audiences in a reality that's removed from their own yet strikes something deep and dark within us all.” Pocketpair and Surgent gave few details about the game in Thursday’s announcement, other than to describe it as “short and weird.”\n“The world is so raw right now, and it feels natural to craft an experience that reflects and feeds off that intensity,” Salim says.\nPocketpair Publishing has not announced any other future projects. The company has been embroiled in legal drama since last year, when Nintendo filed a lawsuit in Tokyo claiming Palworld infringed on its copyright. Nintendo did not respond to a request for comment. When asked if the lawsuit was of any concern to Surgent, Salim says the studio isn’t worried. “We’re really excited to be working with their new publishing wing to bring this game to life,” he says.",

OpenAI claims it has the potential to automate many day-to-day tasks and workday errands.\nOpenAI’s Operator follows rival releases by both Google and Anthropic, which have demonstrated ones capable of using the web. AI agents are widely seen as the next evolutionary stage for AI following chatbots, and many companies have hopped on the hype train by touting them. In most cases, these are very limited in their abilities and simply use a language model to automate things normally done with regular software.\n“AI is evolving from this tool that could answer your questions to one that is also able to take action in the world, carrying out complex, multistep workflows,” says Peter Welinder, VP of product at OpenAI. “We'll see a lot of impact on people’s productivity—but also the quality of work that people are able to accomplish.”\nOpenAI admits that giving ChatGPT access to a web browser does introduce new risks, and it says that Operator may sometimes misbehave. It says it has implemented various new safeguards and plans to extend Operator’s capabilities gradually.\nWelinder and Yash Kumar, product and engineering lead for OpenAI’s Computer Using Agent, say the plan is to learn from how people use the tool. They acknowledge that the tool could make unwanted bookings or purchases but add that a lot of work has gone into ensuring that it asks before doing anything risky. “It will come back to me and ask for confirmations before taking steps that might be irreversible,” Kumar says.\nOpenAI today also released a new “system card” outlining the problems that might arrive with Operator. These include the potential for it to misunderstand commands or diverge from what a user asks; to be misused by users; or to be targeted by cybercriminals.\n“It also poses an incredible amount of safety challenges,” Kumar says. “Because your attack vector area and your risk vector area increase quite significantly.”\nOperator will initially be available as a “research preview” for ChatGPT users with a Pro account, which costs a hefty $200 per month. The company says it plans to expand access while rolling the tool out slowly, because it will inevitably make some mistakes along the way.\nIn several demonstrations, Operator showed the potential for AI to take on a more active role as a web helper. The tool features a remote web browser and a chat window for communicating with a user.\nAt WIRED’s request, Operator was asked to book an Amtrak train trip from New Haven, Connecticut, to Washington, DC. It went to the right website and entered the necessary information correctly to bring up the timetable, then asked for further instruction. If a user were logged in to the Amtrak website or into a browser profile with stored credit card information, Operator would be able to go ahead and book a ticket—although it is designed to ask for permission first.\nKumar asked Operator to book a table at Beretta, a restaurant in San Francisco. The program went to the OpenTable website, found the correct restaurant, and looked up availability before asking what to do next. OpenAI says it has partnered with a number of popular sites, including OpenTable, to ensure that Operator works smoothly on them.\nThe new tool is based on OpenAI’s GPT-4o AI model, which can perceive a browser and web page and converse in typed text. The tool incorporates additional training designed to help it understand how to execute tasks online. OpenAI will also make its Computer Use Agent available through its API.",

    "content_text": "It would be inaccurate to refer to Enrique Tarrio, who was the leader of the Proud Boys on January 6, 2021, when dozens of members stormed the Capitol, as the gang’s “ex–chairman.”\nWithin hours of being sprung free from a federal prison in Pollock, Louisiana, on Tuesday, Tarrio called into Infowars to speak with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to correct the record.\nDuring that call, Tarrio—who received a sentence of 22 years for seditious conspiracy charges but was freed thanks to the flurry of nearly 1,600 pardons and sentence commutations for January 6-ers issued by the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump—made it very clear that he had absolutely no intention of distancing himself from the far-right street-fighting gang.\n“As far as my future with the organization goes, I’m not going anywhere,” Tarrio said. “We’ve made the decision not to talk publicly about the group’s structure. But I have some suggestions for the media: They should stop calling me the ex–Proud Boys leader.”\nIt’s been a long time coming, but it appears that the Proud Boys are plotting a comeback. And they want revenge.\n“I'm happy that the president is focusing not on retribution, and focusing on success. But I will tell you, I'm not going to play by those rules,” Tarrio told Jones. “The people who did this, they need to feel the heat, they need to be put behind bars, they need to be prosecuted. They need to be imprisoned. We need to find and put them behind bars for what they did.”\n“The Proud Boys are not terrorist masterminds. These are not the brightest neofascists out there,” said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. “But they are committed to the cause. They are single-minded in this mission now: for revenge, for retribution. And as we’ve seen before, they are willing to go across state lines and use violence in furtherance of their goals.”\nAn analysis of Proud Boys’ social media channels by the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism identified a surge in online activity following the January 6 pardons, including discussions of ramping up real-world activism to help further the Trump administration's agenda. “Posts from Proud Boys groups reveal an emboldened network, with members fantasizing about mass deportation schemes and threatening to escalate their attacks during Pride Month,” the GPAHE said in a statement. “These developments point to a broader alignment between extremist groups and the Trump regime, raising urgent concerns about public safety and the normalization of far-right violence.” A North Carolina chapter, via its Telegram channel, proposed carrying out “bount[ies on illegals.” A chapter in upstate New York gleefully circulated a rumor that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was offering $750 rewards to turn in undocumented immigrants.\nIn the years since the Capitol riot, as dozens of Proud Boy members and leaders copped charges for the insurrection, the group became increasingly elusive and unpredictable. They pivoted away from large-scale public demonstrations—which would often involve 100 or so Proud Boys descending on a city, clad in yellow and black, reeking of beer, looking for media attention and fights—and instead embedded themselves into hyperlocal culture wars across the country, in many cases aligning themselves with Christian nationalists. They started showing up to small protests against vaccines, crashed school board meetings, and intimidated attendees at drag brunches. For the most part, they stayed away from cities or towns where they were likely to encounter opposition.\nThough they mobilized in a few instances in support of Trump ahead of the 2024 election, it was, overall, fairly lackluster, especially compared to 2020. This drove speculation that the gang was on its last legs.\nThen, on Monday, as Trump was taking the oath of office, more than 100 uniformed Proud Boys marched through the streets of Washington, DC, led by their south-Florida chapter.\nIt was a striking scene—one that seemed intended to send a clear message: “We’re back.”\nEver since January 6, 2021, DC has been perceived by the far right as a no-go zone for Trump supporters of all stripes. But on Monday the Proud Boys chanted “Whose streets—our streets.” They received a hero’s welcome by other Trump supporters in the crowd, as seen on video recorded by freelance journalist Ford Fischer.\nOn Tuesday, as bureaucratic snafus delayed the release of about a dozen January 6-ers from the DC jail, protesters gathered outside. Among them were at least four uniformed Proud Boys. Though three of them had their faces covered, they milled around with what appeared to be zero concern about stigma from others present. Oath Keeper founder Stewart Rhodes, whose 18-year sentence for seditious conspiracy was commuted by Trump, also appeared outside the jail—having walked free from a federal prison in Maryland the previous night.\nOne of the Proud Boys present spoke at the impromptu rally outside of the jail, identifying himself as “Harry Fox.” (This was the same name that other Proud Boys had given to reporters on Inauguration Day.)\n“Donald Trump is back, baby. He is back, and he is stronger than ever,” he said over the microphone. “I’m so proud of what the American citizens did that day,” he added, referring to January 6, “for standing up finally after decades of being abused and oppressed by an authoritarian regime.”\nHe ended his speech with the Proud Boys slogan: “I am a Western chauvinist, and I will not apologize for creating the modern world.” The crowd cheered.\nTarrio, in his phone call to Jones on Tuesday, made it clear that he views the role of the Proud Boys as being no different to what it was four years ago—he sees them as the foot soldiers and the muscle of the GOP. “I think the future of the club will be what it’s always been,” said Tarrio. “A group of men that love America, get around and drink beer, and protect Trump supporters from being assaulted … We will defend ourselves and Trump supporters from being assaulted for their political views.”\nHe suggested that he feels vindicated by Trump’s election victory and decision to pardon almost everyone involved in the January 6 riot. “We went through hell, and I’m gonna tell you: It was worth it,” Tarrio told Jones. “What we stood for and what those guys stood for is what we’ve been fighting for, is what we saw yesterday on the inauguration stage … I can’t tell you it's been easy. But I will tell you it's been worth it.”\nWhatever stigma may have been attached to the Proud Boys appears to have dissipated.\nTrump has defended his decision to pardon or commute the sentences of January 6-ers, including those of notorious Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. And when asked by a reporter whether he could envision a place for members of those groups in politics. “Well, we have to see,” Trump responded. “They’ve been given a pardon. I thought their sentences were ridiculous and excessive.”\nBut even with talks of revenge and plans for the future, the gang is far less cohesive than it was prior to January 6. The arrests of members and leaders in connection to the Capitol riot fueled paranoia about informants and exacerbated existing rifts—especially after a report published in late January 2021 exposed Tarrio’s history as a “prolific” police informant. The Proud Boys claimed that they dissolved the group’s “Sovereign Chapter” in the years following, leaving the chapters to operate autonomously. The group also struggled to find its place in the broader far-right ecosystem, with some chapters cozying up to even more extreme factions like neo-Nazis as others sought legitimacy by seeking alliances with conservative influencers.\nBut as January 6 showed, someone doesn’t need to be a card-carrying member of a group, Proud Boys or otherwise, to be emboldened by the pardons. “How many people are going to be emboldened by this, how many are going to take this as justification, as their call to arms, to say ‘we have to fight now against the prosecutors, the FBI agents, the so-called deep state,’” says Lewis. “These are people who have a track record of being allowed to commit violence in the name of their ideology, and they’ve been given a second chance to do just that.”",

    "content_text": "In the first 48 hours of President Donald Trump’s second term in office, he has taken action on virtually every single culture war topic that has excited his base for the last 12 months, including the signing of dozens of executive orders targeting immigrants, gender expression, the environment, and DEI policies.\nTrump has also pardoned or commuted the sentence of every single person that took part in the violent insurrection at the Capitol in 2021. Meanwhile, his close ally Elon Musk has invigorated an even more extreme wing of Trump’s supporters, by making a Nazi-like salute onstage—twice—in front of thousands of people in DC and millions watching on TV.\nTrump’s actions have generated a lot of excitement among the far-right in the US. They’ve also been hailed as a blueprint by an adoring fan base of far-right lawmakers, extremist influencers, and white supremacist groups across the globe. And those people and organizations now believe that Trump’s actions should not only be copied, but taken to the next level.\n“It is more than just a political success,” Martin Sellner, the far-right activist and leader of the Identitarian Movement of Austria, wrote on his Telegram channel. “It is a metapolitical victory: the end of wokeness and trans ideology, stopping illegal immigration and many other ideas have been normalized in society.”\n“These extremists think that this is the way to go, that their countries need to take a lesson from what Trump is proposing, and they need to not get weak about it, and not let woke activists get in their way, because everybody knows that the right thing to do is get rid of the immigrants,” Wendy Via, the CEO of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, tells WIRED.\nSellner, who once communicated with the Christchurch massacre shooter, is best known for popularizing the white nationalist concept of “remigration,” the idea to ethnically cleanse western nations of all nonwhite citizens. That extremist ideology has gained traction among other far-right groups in Europe, including Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Freedom Party of Austria. Trump even promoted “remigration” in September.\nNow, Sellner believes that Trump’s return to the Oval Office signals a moment to take his agenda mainstream.\n“By pushing further into the realm of the ‘unspeakable’ we move out of the defensive and truly shift the Overton Window to the right for the first time,” Sellner wrote. “Even if you think Trumpism goes far enough, you should support the radical flank.”\nSellner is not alone in Europe. Across the continent, far-right figures praised Trump’s actions on migration and gender, and called for leaders in their own countries to follow suit.\nIn France, the Generation Identity group, the youth wing of the far-right Identitarian movement, wrote on Telegram: “Remigration in full swing. Identitarianism has won ideologically, it will only take time for this victory to be reflected in the material world.”\nIn Ireland, Keith Woods, the far-right influencer and ally of US white supremacist Nick Fuentes, shared a clip of Musk’s Nazi-like salute with the caption: “Ok maybe woke really is dead.” Irish UFC fighter Conor McGregor, who has aligned himself with Ireland’s far-right community in recent years, was in the Capitol for the inauguration and met with House speaker Mike Johnson. McGregor praised Trump’s immigration policies and wrote on Instagram, “Ireland and its human trafficking racket needs absolute dismantling! It is a breach of our security and our sovereignty. For me it is A NATIONAL EMERGENCY.” (McGregor has recently said that he is considering running for president in Ireland, which is a symbolic role without any real power.)\nIn the UK, Tommy Robinson, whose legal bills are now being footed by Elon Musk, wrote that Trump’s inauguration signaled that “freedom is back” and hailed the “return of the king.” Robinson, who is currently in jail for making repeated false allegations against a Syrian refugee, which led to death threats against their family, is a well-known Islamophobic activist and former member of the fascist British National Party. Robinson’s compatriot Mark Collet, who heads up the white supremacist Patriotic Alternative group, praised the pardoning of the January 6 prisoners, writing on Telegram: “What a first day, this is a massive redemption arc.”\nIn Brazil, far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro, who was invited to the inauguration but could not travel because of his alleged role in a Brazilian coup attempt in 2023, wrote a lengthy message to Trump, saying that “under Trump’s leadership, the West is being reborn.” He added that Trump’s return “reaffirms the pillars of our civilization: God, nation, family, and freedom.”\nIn Germany, Sebastian Schmidtke, the leader of the neo-Nazi Die Heimat party, wrote, “Greetings back from Germany @elonmusk” above a clip on X of Musk’s Nazi-like salute. The country’s far-right publication COMPACT also praised Trump’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization, citing the organization’s “evil nature during the Corona period.”\n“There is huge support for Trump in the German far-right, and they see themselves emboldened by it,” Miro Dittrich, a researcher who focuses on German extremist groups, tells WIRED.\nDittrich analyzed the links shared in thousands of German-speaking far-right and conspiracy-driven Telegram channels, and found that they had a strong focus on Trump, Musk, and the US inauguration as compared to the upcoming German elections.\nIn Australia, neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell shared a picture of himself making a similar salute to Musk’s, writing on X: “Donald Trump, White Power, Patriots are in control.”\n“This is the vision they have for the world, and Trump is their hero at the moment,” says Via.",

What is truth? Truth is, it's up for debate. Yeah.\nMichael Calore: It is. Literally.\nZoë Schiffer: We're a post-truth era.\nMichael Calore: Ain't that the truth?\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I feel like we've been saying that for years, but now it really feels true.\nMichael Calore: Well, the truth and how to moderate it online, and specifically how Mark Zuckerberg is thinking about it is what we are here to examine. So I hope the two of you have some time on your hands.\nZoë Schiffer: Let's do it.\nMichael Calore: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm Zoë Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nLauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: Today we're talking about content moderation because the big news over the past couple of weeks is that Meta is ending its third-party fact-checking program and replacing it with a Community Notes model. Now to be clear, the company is still keeping its automated systems for flagging problematic content, but Mark Zuckerberg has also said that Meta would be refocusing or tweaking those systems to flag what he calls high-severity violations. So we'll get into all of these changes and talk about their potential impacts.\nLauren Goode: Zoë, how would you describe Community Notes for the uninitiated?\nZoë Schiffer: It's basically crowdsourced fact-checking. The idea is that you get users to apply to these programs. If they get in, they become part of the Community Notes forum, which means that when a post is flagged, they have a debate with other people in the forum, should it have a note attached to it with a bit more context. The issue is that on X, what we've seen from inside these forums is that a lot of the people involved are pretty politically motivated. But in theory, it's a way to kind of allow the community to moderate content on the platform themselves.\nLauren Goode: Right. The idea of Community Notes may have worked really well about 20 to 30 years ago in the early days of the internet, the World Wide Web. But when you're looking at the amount of content that is posted online now, it's not exactly the same. I mean, I think a lot of these Meta changes are just going to encourage more content to surface, just more of everything, which is very good for engagement for Meta, for its bottom line, and possibly or probably bad for humanity.\nZoë Schiffer: It feels like it's bigger than just Meta. Like you mentioned. It's kind of following in the footsteps of X in terms of turning to a Community Notes-style fact-checking program. So to me, it gets to this bigger question of, are we in a new era of content moderation, and what does that mean for the world?\nMichael Calore: So let's back up for a moment and clarify what we're talking about when we talk about content moderation.\nLauren Goode: When I look at content moderation, I see it as part of usually what is a trust and safety team at a tech company or a social media company. Trust and safety has a larger mandate than just content moderation, but content moderation tends to fall into secondary and tertiary levels of trust and safety work. The idea with content moderation is that you're looking at types of posts that could cause real harm, and that's either through misinformation or hate speech. It's not personalized. It's not someone on Facebook saying they have a cat named Bo when their cat's name is Boo. Or someone saying, \"I won an award,\" and they didn't really win an award, and they're inflating themselves. This is misinformation generally accepted as truth that affects people on a societal level.\nZoë Schiffer: I think that's a good definition. I think of it really like the people and policies that decide which posts stay up and which ones come down. Often the ones that are supposed to come down are ones that violate a platform's rules. So we talk about the First Amendment and free speech a lot in relation to content moderation, but in reality, none of these companies have to abide by the First Amendment. It's not a government entity. So it's really about what policies have we set up as a company, have we said that we're OK with versus not OK with? Then what systems do we have in place to regulate which posts stay up and come down?\nMichael Calore: In the past, the ancient past, it fell on human beings, like moderators in small communities. I'm talking like pre-Facebook internet. You had Listservs, you had forums, you had places where people would hang out, and it would be dozens or hundreds of people. You had human moderators sort of making decisions on a case-by-case basis of what sorts of things would be allowed, what sorts of things step over the line of the community guidelines that the community decided on for itself. Of course, there are a lot of sites and platforms and communities that are still employing this type of content moderation. Reddit famously has mods. There are even subreddits for complaining about mods, things like that. But if you belong to a community and there's 2,000 or 3,000 people in those communities, you show up, there's a list of rules, things that are allowed, things that are not allowed, and they're what you would expect. We do not allow name-calling. We don't allow threats of violence. We don't allow things that are not within the scope of this community to be posted here. It's a moderator's job, often with the help of bots, to go through all of the posts that are made and decide which ones don't belong and get rid of them.\nZoë Schiffer: This also happens on Wikipedia. Wikipedia obviously has volunteer editors. There's a hierarchy. You have to be one of the chosen. But I will say, I know Reddit and Wikipedia have had a lot of issues with content moderation, but these processes seem to work pretty well on the platforms. I would say part of the reason for that is that we have the media literacy to treat what we read on Wikipedia with a certain level of suspicion. It's both surprisingly accurate a lot of the time, but I think a lot of us are used to saying, “OK, I'll Wikipedia as a first order of research, but I'll obviously do a deeper dive and read the source material when needed.”\nLauren Goode: There are an incredible number of citations on Wikipedia too. So it's easy then to go to one of the source materials, and then from there use that same level of media literacy to determine if that seems like a valid source. But then there are people contributing, who are looking for those valid sources to cite. I think that's one of the differences too, not that we're talking about Google Gen AI in this episode so much, but the difference is people just look at those summarized search results now and say, “That must be true,” even if there is a little citation somewhere. Whereas in Wikipedia, you go and then hopefully you go further from there.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. But then in the Facebook era and then in the Twitter era, these platforms, these social platforms evolved that were all owned by one company, and then the company could set a policy that would apply to all of their communities. I think that's when things really started to change.\nLauren Goode: Well, and it started to change, too, just when the number of users on Facebook swelled to over a billion people. I can't say exactly what date Facebook first deployed an algorithm to try to detect harmful content. But we do know it was around late 2016 when Facebook first said it was partnering with places like the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network. So at that point, it was using both human moderators and automated systems to try to limit what everyone at the time was concerned about, which was basically fake news.\nZoë Schiffer: Right. I think just to take it back a little bit further even, it's like a lot of these tech platforms start out with similar values around free speech. They're like, “We started these companies to maximize speech or to create a global town square,” whatever, but then they all kind of agree like, “Oh wait, we can't have child sexual exploitation material. We can't have illegal content. You can't sell drugs on the platform.” So slowly, slowly they start to limit the amount of speech that can actually happen on the platform.\nMichael Calore: So in the most recent modern era, since 2016, what has Meta been doing?\nLauren Goode: Well, 2016 feels like a turning point in a sense, because this was when they started partnering with a handful of traditional news organizations and fact-checking sites. The thing is that a lot of the impetus for this was misinformation around the 2016 presidential election, like the fake news that the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump or conspiracy theories around Hillary Clinton. So Meta was, or Facebook at the time, they were really sort of targeting that by leaning on these third-party organizations. Then I think they still had the automated systems in place to try to tackle some of the other hateful or harmful speech that was happening on the platform. What's interesting about this is that it feels like at the time Facebook did in a sense believe that it had a moral imperative to do this, to try to crack down on that. It was acknowledging that having all this misinformation on a platform as big as Facebook could have a negative impact on society,\nMichael Calore: Right.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. I feel like this was the era of Mark Zuckerberg really taking ownership and being like, “We know we've messed up. Here's all the investments that we're making to make this better.” But it's also true that each one of these systems had advantages and disadvantages.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nZoë Schiffer: Meta invested enormously in teams of contract human moderators whose entire job it was to look at the worst that the internet had to offer, at least the worst that Meta's platforms had to offer, and decide which posts should stay up, which should come down, and occasionally which ones should be escalated for further review. The issue is that these people are not necessarily working at the corporate offices. They're allegedly often being paid pretty low wages from contracting firms and they're looking at really traumatizing content all day. Really, really violent images, child sexual abuse material, that sort of thing. Honestly, there's been a lot of allegations about how traumatized they're getting and the fact that the companies they work for allegedly don't have the mental health resources to really support them. So it's creating a lot of issues for these people.\nMichael Calore: So we're facing a shift on all of Meta's platforms to a Community Notes style of fact-checking. What does that look like on X? How is it going to look on Instagram? How's it going to look on Meta, Facebook?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, so when someone posts on these platforms, rather than having these fact checking or news organizations deciding, is this post correct? We're going to have real people in the community, so users, and it's supposed to be a large enough user base that you have people who come at this from all different sides of the political spectrum who are having that debate and then posting a note attached to it. On X, at least in terms of big breaking news events, it hasn't worked that well. But I actually feel like there is potential for this system to work well. It just hasn't been implemented correctly at X for unsurprising reasons. So when Mark Zuckerberg made this announcement, I felt like all of my group chats were popping off and 100 percent of the voices were aghast and really anti this decision. I had a moment where I was like at least for this part of the change. To be clear, I think a lot of the changes are extremely problematic and will create a lot of real-world harm. I'm genuinely worried about that. But in terms of scrapping the third-party fact-checking system and going to Community Notes, I am willing to entertain the possibility that this could be good if implemented correctly.\nLauren Goode: I think you bring up a good point, Zoë, about how for unsurprising reasons Community Notes might not be working on X. I think what you're referring to is the fact that Musk is using X as his personal megaphone now, and he has a lot of stans on that platform. I read that at least 50 of Musk's own posts last year promoted information about the US elections that fact-checkers said were false or misleading, and they amassed something like a billion views and none of these had Community Notes attached. This is according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which has been studying this.\nZoë Schiffer: It's easily gamified on X right now. I'm actually not sure if that's just because they don't have enough people in the Community Notes forum or if it's that … I've kind of seen this firsthand and in talking to sources, who allege that Community Notes can be pretty politically motivated. It seems like at least on X, there's a large contingent of the fact-checkers who are very, very pro-Musk and are looking for stories that paint him in what they see as a biased light. They're attaching spurious Community Notes on those stories, and then they're not adequately fact-checking Musk's own posts. So there's a lot of problems. But again, to me, this isn't so much a failure of Community Notes overall as much as it is a failure of X's version of Community Notes.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Also, I'll say that I don't really have a lot of faith that this is going to stop the spread of misinformation or stop the spread of hateful content, simply because we've all been there where we see a post that we understand is fake or we understand possibly could be considered by most people to be hateful, and it may have some sort of note under it, or maybe people are sounding off in the comments about the fact that it's fake or that it's hateful and maybe it's been flagged. But it's still there, and it's still being shared. I think that people who are going to share those types of things are going to be inclined to share them even if it has some sort of mechanism attached to it that says, “Our community has flagged this as possibly not good.”\nZoë Schiffer: I think the purpose of this change is not to stop the spread of harmful content. To me, the purpose of this change is definitely to ingratiate Meta with the Trump administration, and it honestly seems like that's gone over pretty well.\nMichael Calore: That's a big claim, and it's a big moment, and I agree with you. I think when Mark Zuckerberg talks about this, he says that stopping people from talking about things like transgender issues puts Meta in a position that is out of step with modern discourse. So he says that people talk about these things, and we have to let them talk about them on our platforms in a way that is not overseen or regulated, just because that's the way that people talk now.\nLauren Goode: Right, but to Zoë's point, he also basically admits that he was very put off by what he saw as an overreach by the Biden administration to try to “censor” Facebook during the Covid pandemic. So I think that Zuckerberg is giving all kinds of reasons for why he's making this decision now, whether it's, “Oh, we've scaled, we're at such a scale that our systems can't possibly address all of this, or this is just the way people talk these days, and we want to give people the ability to say what they want. Anyone who quits Facebook at this point is virtue signaling. Have at it. We still have plenty of users.” When really it is a political reaction and maneuver. I was talking to someone in tech and asked them, what do you think about the changes that Meta is making to its content moderation policies? They said, “Zuckerberg is kind of like a weather vane. He just moves in the right direction depending on the wind. But the problem is he's also so powerful now that he generates a lot of wind, so when he tips the weather vane, he's now moving the wind in a new direction.”\nZoë Schiffer: I found this whole topic so interesting because I was coming at it from a place of maybe this change could be positive. I want to believe that Community Notes could work. At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg's actions and the way he talked about them made me feel like he's very opportunistic. He's company first, and he's doing what he needs to do to get in good with this incoming administration. It definitely did not seem to come from a principled stance in so far as those principles are important to him, personally.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. So how is Zuckerberg's decision resonating with other people in Silicon Valley? Because I know what the headlines say. The headlines say that Meta is just giving up on content moderation and that kind of anything goes, and we're in Meta's AI slop era now.\nLauren Goode: Right, right. Well, and Meta would probably, or Zuckerberg himself might even respond and say, “Well, those are just the elite established media who are reacting that way,” because he talked about that on the Joe Rogan podcast too. That person I spoke to in the Valley made that remark about Zuckerberg being a weather vane. I've also talked to people who worked in trust and safety directly who have said it's just a really hard problem to solve.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I feel like there's the media which seemed to think this was a very bad idea, and again, there were newsrooms that were involved in the fact-checking process, so obviously we're going to think it's bad when these programs are killed. There's the trust and safety world, which I saw saying, “We really disagree with this change,” but interestingly, a lot of them were not pointing to the switch from human moderators and algorithms over to Community Notes as much as they were the fact that Meta is not going to proactively look for lesser violations. That was the one that started to really worry that group of people. Then we had the tech elite, the Silicon Valley billionaires, the venture capitalists, the people who are friends with Elon Musk. These people seem extremely excited. We all listened to Mark Zuckerberg's interview with Joe Rogan. Rogan seemed thrilled about the change, as did the guys on the All In podcast. While they might've disagreed with why Zuck made the change, I think everyone seemed very, very excited that in their view he was coming around.\nLauren Goode: There are so many layers to this, and I think what we've talked about a lot so far are his motivations. That's a little bit harder because all we can do is sort of look at his actions and his policy decisions over the past several years and say, \"OK, this lines up, or this is what he said, this podcast or in this interview, and this is all pretty consistent.\" We don't really know his motivations. We can't get inside Mark Zuckerberg's head. Then there's the practical implementation of what he's putting forward, and I think everyone can agree content moderation on a platform that has at least 2 billion daily active users around the world, people logging into it every day, is a very hard problem to solve. It is, right? Now, my harsher take on that is that I have 215 billion reasons why it is actually Mark Zuckerberg's job to solve this. That is his net worth. He wanted the job, he started this company, he wanted voting control, and this is the job. He said on Joe Rogan, “Well, if I just did this all the time, I wouldn't have time to focus on AI or smart glasses. Things that we understand are very important to the company's bottom line.” Mark, I just want to say we don't necessarily need the smart glasses. We need to fix content moderation. We need you to fix content moderation. That is the job.\nMichael Calore: Zoë's snapping her fingers in agreement. I agree with you too. I mean, it is the thing that makes it a fun place to hang out is the fact that it's a happy place on the internet. You can go there, you can see things that make you smile, and the more that you see things that don't make you smile, the harder it gets to keep going back there. Knowing that he's made these decisions makes it harder for me to decide to go back there. I just know that it's a different kind of beast now. What we're going to be feeding it and the types of conversations that are going to be happening there are going to be very different, and I think it's going to feel very different going into the year. We're going to take a quick break. When we come back, we're going to get into Lauren's 215 billion reasons why content moderation is important, and we're also going to talk about what might happen on social media at large in the wake of these changes. Stay with us. You're listening to Uncanny Valley.\n[break]\nMichael Calore: So we've been talking about the recent changes around content moderation and speech moderation at Meta. One of the things that we cannot ignore is that the same week that Mark Zuckerberg announced all these changes coming to Meta's content moderation policies, he started talking about it publicly. Here he is on the Joe Rogan podcast:\nMark Zuckerberg [archival audio]: It goes back to our original mission, is just give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.\nMichael Calore: I do think it's important to talk about Zuck's appearance on the show because he does talk at length about his motivations. We can't step inside of his head and we can't say what's really going on there, but we have a pretty clear idea about why these changes are coming to Meta. So where should we start?\nZoë Schiffer: I mean, he really framed this as a return to his roots. On the podcast he kind of speaks to that ethos and the idea that he never really wanted to be in a position of deciding what's true and what's not. He says that in his view, misinformation and hate speech in particular in recent years became very politicized. So it definitely feels like under the Biden administration, Meta was being asked to take down a lot of Covid misinformation, hate speech, other things. Zuck says he was growing increasingly uncomfortable with that, and so this is an opportunity to right the ship in his view.\nLauren Goode: Let’s talk a little bit more about what exactly went down, because it wasn't just the requests from the Biden administration for him to moderate Covid information. I mean, this goes back to when he was grilled in front of Congress. Right?\nZoë Schiffer: This went all the way up to the Supreme Court in a famous job owning case recently. But yeah, I mean basically Zuck is saying, “Look, the Biden administration was coming to us. We had people from the administration literally yelling at my employees, saying, you have to take this stuff down. So we were putting a lot of investment in place and trying to moderate content at a scale and in a way that we'd never done before.” It's so interesting because moderating this type of content, moderating misinformation and hate speech opened Meta up to a lot of criticism from both the right and the left. The right, because conservatives are moderated more on these grounds, because they tend to speak in this way more, and the left because we were still seeing all sorts of content stay up that a lot of people on the left thought should come down. So making this decision saying, “We're actually going to moderate a lot less speech than we have in recent memory,” endears Meta to the right and opens it up to criticism from the left. But it's like in some ways a better position to be in than where they were at previously, where both sides thought we were horrible and messing up.\nLauren Goode: He also made some interesting remarks about the government's role and how it treats tech companies.\nMark Zuckerberg [archival audio]: The US government should be defending its companies, not be the tip of the spear attacking its companies.\nLauren Goode: Look, Zuckerberg is clearly a very intelligent individual, and he's trying to work through these things. But I thought this was interesting because he said that he thought the US government shouldn't be adversarial toward its own tech companies, because that paves the way for other countries to also penalize their companies.\nMark Zuckerberg [archival audio]: It's basically just open season around the rest of the world. The EU, I pulled these numbers, the EU has fined the tech companies more than $30 billion over the last, I think, it was like 10 or 20 years.\nLauren Goode: He pointed to Europe as an example, and all the fines that it has levied on American tech companies in recent years. He also pointed out that we already have plenty of adversaries like Russia and Iran to deal with. But it's actually not the US government's singular job to be a booster for American enterprise. It also has a responsibility to protect its citizens, and there are entire agencies that exist, and for good reason, to make sure companies in the private sector aren't taking advantage of or harming consumers. I think he just, I don't know, conveniently ignored that.\nZoë Schiffer: You do hear the Silicon Valley billionaire class talk about this a lot. They're like, “Well, Trump just wants America to win.” That's really appealing to them, because they see their own companies and their venture capital firms as a core part of that winning strategy.\nMichael Calore: What I think is interesting is the timing of all of this. We cannot ignore the politics when we look at the timing, because if you consider content moderation coming into focus for Meta in 2016, all eyes were on the company during the 2020 election. Again, all eyes were on the company during the 2024 election. So Meta kept its policies in place for fact-checking up until the election, the election happened, Trump won the presidency again, and then two months later they're shutting down the shop. I kind of feel like, “OK, let's do the bare minimum until we can get past this point where we don't really have to worry about it anymore, and then we can stop worrying about it.” That really feels like what happened. Whether or not that's appeasing Republicans or whether or not that is trying to open up conversation to the winners in this scenario so that they feel more comfortable on our platform because they're in power now. I really feel like it's more like, “OK, we've done the thing that we promised we would do, and now we just don't really have to worry about it anymore.”\nZoë Schiffer: I think there's another factor at play here, which is that previously, I think not every company thought of it this way, but there was this line that content moderation is a product, and it's a product that in some ways you sell to advertisers. When you have a platform that is ad supported, you need to make sure that Nike isn't paying millions of dollars and seeing their ads show up next to a violent video, or hate speech, or what have you. With X in particular, when Elon Musk rolled back a lot of the fact-checking programs, the trust and safety policies, we saw advertisers take a real stand and flee. Under a Trump administration, do we think these massive multinational conglomerates, these big corporations are going to take a principled stand like that? Or are they going to say, “Okay, whatever, it's an advertising platform, we'll keep spending money.” I would be surprised if we saw a big advertiser exodus. Maybe they will make those decisions and they'll just make it quietly. But I almost think that the business calculus for content moderation has changed under a Trump administration.\nLauren Goode: Zoë, you've mentioned something before that I find really interesting, which is this idea that if some organization or company were to get content moderation right, they could sell it as a product. What does that look like?\nZoë Schiffer: I mean, I think if you are a place where you're like, \"We have the best algorithms in place, we have the best trust and safety policies, you can be 100 percent certain that if you spend thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars on our platform to advertise with us, 100 percent of the time, your ad will not show up next to anything bad. It will show up next to the tweet from LeBron James, which is all you've ever wanted.\" I think that that would be a compelling use case for advertisers, because advertisers don't want to spend all of that money and see their ad … It's embarrassing for them if it runs next to something really vile. At the same time, if every platform is doing the opposite of what we're saying, if they're moderating less content, and advertisers are kind of like, \"OK, this is just what it means to advertise on social media.\" I don't know if they're going to be pulling ad dollars like they did with Elon or with Facebook in 2020.\nMichael Calore: I think we'll have to see how bad it gets, because soon we'll probably see more AI-generated images of things that are fake, fake images of famous people, fake images of political figures. We're probably going to see more hateful content, things that are hateful towards women, towards transgender people, towards immigrants. We'll probably see more fake news, things that are intended to rile us up if we feel a certain way about the world, things that are very sharable. There's probably also going to be a lot of AI profiles, like AI people sharing things, nonplayer characters in our feeds. However many there are now, which is probably a lot more than we realize, there's going to be more. So as these things increase, it's going to start to feel a lot different to hang out at those places for users and for advertisers. I don't know if advertisers are going to stick around if that becomes like what is shared dominantly on the platforms.\nZoë Schiffer: Well, Mike, that immediately makes me think that advertisers can have whatever stance they want, but ultimately they are paying to have their ad in front of the maximum number of eyeballs. So if users find it bad to hang out on these platforms for all of the reasons you just stated and they start to flee, then advertisers are going to vote with their dollars and they're also going to exit. So this is going to be, I think, a really interesting phenomenon to watch.\nMichael Calore: There's a lot of people who think that that's fun. It's fun to show up and share all the images of Trump in the Superman costume.\nZoë Schiffer: Well, they can stick around.\nMichael Calore: One thing that I'm curious about that's very distressing to me to think about is what the future of the moderation industry is. I didn't even really think about this at first until our colleague, David Gilbert, wrote a fantastic story for WIRED, which you can read, about the moderation industry and how so many of these companies, basically when they got the Meta contracts in the 2010s, they set up departments and they hired all these people to do the fact checking for Meta. Now that Meta is shutting down the program and not keeping all of those contracts anymore, a lot of these companies are going to be out of the social media content moderation business, which means that this change is going to be much more far-reaching. It's going to have much bigger impact than just Meta. I'm wondering what that future looks like across all of social media.\nLauren Goode: I mean, to me, this goes back to the idea that we're in a post social media era. It's not just about post-truth, it's about these apps, and services, and feeds, and containers that came to define how we connected to people and how we shared things over the past, let's say 15 years, even though Facebook's been around since 2004. It's fundamentally shifting, and I don't think we have yet landed on what is the next social experience online then totally. I certainly don't know what it is. I don't know if it's... I think a lot of us are using private group chats. I think people are leaning on newsletters instead of other types of distributed information. I think it's time to acknowledge that the social media we knew it as the 2010s is dead.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. I agree with Lauren on that.\nMichael Calore: I think you're right.\nLauren Goode: Content moderation is a huge part of that.\nZoë Schiffer: To the extent we ever had a global town square, which I kind of roll my eyes at that phrasing, but I certainly think that we do not have one now and we will not have one in the foreseeable future.\nLauren Goode: No, we don't. We've all had these personal feeds, these personal experiences, and it really was all, we talked about this on an earlier podcast, but it really was all about the self and feeding the self. Then there are these collective experiences that are supposed to be happening on social media too. I think people are just continuing to posts to their personal feeds as much as they want, but you cannot ignore the collapse of what the collective experience has been.\nMichael Calore: To that collective experience, to that global town square, that was absolutely my favorite thing about the old Twitter was that it was people of all different political ideologies all in one place, and it was still fun most of the time. It was still fun. It kind of stopped being fun. Now it's like the Internet's getting more tribal. Now there's a lib zone, there's a red zone, there's a libertarian zone. There's all these different places where you can go and hang out with people who think like you, and I don't know if that's necessarily good for us. That doesn't satisfy my definition of what humanity is, just hanging out with people who feel the same way that you do. So yeah, I'm spending a lot more time on Reddit, weirdly, and not because of this. I just find myself there more often now because it's a place that feels like a community that doesn't have any kind of bizarre ideological pull.\nZoë Schiffer: Meanwhile, I'm just in here with ChatGPT talking to my AI friend.\nMichael Calore: How's the parenting going?\nLauren Goode: How's the sleep training?\nMichael Calore: Is your child calling it mommy yet?\nZoë Schiffer: Oh my God, it's so dark.\nMichael Calore: Okay, well, let's take another break, but stick around because we'll be right back with more Uncanny Valley. All right, friends, the internet is a big place, and I know it takes us down many strange paths. So I would like to know, what is your last rabbit hole? What's the last thing that you went deep on on the internet? What brought you there? Where did you go? How did it turn out? Zoë, let's go to you first.\nZoë Schiffer: The thing that's been on my mind, which is very closely related to what we were just talking about, is whether to stay on Threads. I honestly feel like exhausted even thinking about this. It's kind of a natural shift that has already happened where I am just spending a lot more time on Bluesky because it's more fun and more of my peers are there. So it feels like a more vibrant conversation. But over the past two years, I've made the decision to leave Twitter. I've made the decision to leave Substack in a previous job along with my colleague. Now I'm looking at Threads, and I feel kind of this fatigue of like, am I just going to keep issuing purity tests to these companies that they then fail? Or is it like we do have a real moral imperative to look at where we are spending our time, how we are helping these companies, and whether it makes sense to continue investing our time, energy, and content on platforms that are hostile to our work? But I'm curious what you both think of this, Lauren, I just know you've been waiting for this.\nLauren Goode: Rubs hands together, continues the conversation about Meta. I'm not really on Threads anymore. The account still exists, but I haven't used it in, I don't know, a few weeks at least. I, too, am all in on Bluesky, and I respect that you've gone down this rabbit hole. It's important to think about. There's only so much that we can do individually, but that ends up being a collective action if a bunch of people leave something,\nMichael Calore: I was never really on Threads, so that's an easy one for me. But Instagram is a harder one. I'm conflicted about Instagram because I need it for my side hustle, which is music. If you want to book shows, if you want to connect with other like-minded musicians, Instagram is where that's all happening, and I don't see that changing. So I haven't really decided what to do there yet.\nLauren Goode: Especially during the recent LA wildfires. I got a lot of solid information from Instagram about that. Reading the LA Times through Instagram, seeing people's firsthand accounts, and videos that they were capturing. Let's assume those were not altered or AI generated. I don't believe that they were. Even locally, here in San Francisco, seeing what people were doing to collect donations, and food, and clothing items, and stuff like that, just local actions that people were taking that I ended up participating in, it was really useful for that.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I feel like Lauren, you maybe made this calculation on one of our other podcasts where it's like, to the extent that the platforms are serving us, sure, stay, use it. When we begin serving them more than they're serving us, then maybe we make a decision about whether to stay or whether to go.\nLauren Goode: That's exactly it. Do you miss Twitter at all?\nZoë Schiffer: I never had the experience that Mike describes often on here where it really... Mike, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems like you had a real sense of community on Twitter that was enjoyable, and nice, and a fun place to hang out. I really felt like it was a pretty stressful place for me. That said, I felt like I got a lot of opportunities from having a somewhat sizable Twitter following. So yeah, it's kind of painful to walk away. I've not found another platform where I used it in kind of the manic dedicated way that I did with X and Twitter. It felt like that decision was a bigger decision to just step back from social media.\nMichael Calore: It was the place where all my friends were for maybe three or four years, and then it stopped feeling like that, but I stuck around, and now I'm gone.\nZoë Schiffer: Yep. Lauren, what's your rabbit hole?\nLauren Goode: My rabbit hole is no buy 2025.\nMichael Calore: No buy.\nLauren Goode: From AI shopping assistance to no buying.\nMichael Calore: Wait, is this the part of the podcast where you gas up Facebook, buy nothing groups?\nLauren Goode: No, but I will say Facebook Marketplace is sometimes the thing that draws me back into that app, if anything at all.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: No. So I'll admit that it started from a place of fervent consumerism, which is that I want to buy a new couch, and I've been doing this thing where every time I go over a friend's house recently, I sit on their couch and I'm like, \"What couch is this? Do you like it? How deep is this? Is this 41 inch deep?\" I'm obsessed with couches. So I started looking for couches and I was getting so obsessed with it that I had to take a step back, and then it was like the TikTokers found me, the no buy 2025 girlies appeared in my peripheral vision. They were like, \"Don't buy.\"\nZoë Schiffer: Is it like a finance thing? You're not buying for a budgeting reason or it's like a movement?\nLauren Goode: It's both. It's both for financial reasons, because the girlies are telling... I shouldn't, sorry. The girlies is what we're referred to affectionately as the women on TikTok, and they call themselves that. But they tend to be tallying up, \"Here's how much I'll save in 2025 if I don't do this thing.\" But it's also part of an anti-consumerism movement, broadly, and it's not new, but now it has a nice ring to it, right? Don't buy 2020. It's part of a new year's resolution, basically. No new shoes, unless I have completely worn through the other ones. Or I'm not going to buy any new health and beauty products unless I do something throughout the week that gives me a $50 allotment that I can spend on anything. Everyone can create their own rules, but it's budgeting, but it's fun budgeting.\nZoë Schiffer: I like it.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: That's great.\nLauren Goode: I'm really enjoying that. Yeah. I'm not sure I'm going to do it, but I'm enjoying the hashtag content. What about you, Mike?\nMichael Calore: My rabbit hole is pens. I'm serious.\nZoë Schiffer: You always have the best answers.\nMichael Calore: Okay, so I've been a reporter pretty much my entire adult life, and one of the first things that I learned from my very first editor is that you always carry a pen with you. So I do. I always carry a pen with me. Lauren knows this. I'm pretty fanatical about my devotion towards Fisher Space Pens. If you know the Bullet Space pen, it's very small. It fits in your pocket without bulging or anything, and when you post it, when you pull the cap off and put it on the end, it's a full-size pen. It can go through the wash. You can leave it in a car that's super hot, you can freeze it. It's not going to explode because it has this pressurized ink thing in it. So I traveled at the beginning of January. I went to Las Vegas for CES. God help me. I had my space pen in my pocket. I used it, but it kept falling apart. I think it's so old that it's just not really holding together anymore. I got tired of picking up all the little pieces off the floor. So laying in bed one night, I was like, \"I need a new Space pen.\" I went to my favorite pen shop on the internet, which is Jet Pens, and I started researching other small pens, and I found five or six that I really like.

So I do. I always carry a pen with me. Lauren knows this. I'm pretty fanatical about my devotion towards Fisher Space Pens. If you know the Bullet Space pen, it's very small. It fits in your pocket without bulging or anything, and when you post it, when you pull the cap off and put it on the end, it's a full-size pen. It can go through the wash. You can leave it in a car that's super hot, you can freeze it. It's not going to explode because it has this pressurized ink thing in it. So I traveled at the beginning of January. I went to Las Vegas for CES. God help me. I had my space pen in my pocket. I used it, but it kept falling apart. I think it's so old that it's just not really holding together anymore. I got tired of picking up all the little pieces off the floor. So laying in bed one night, I was like, \"I need a new Space pen.\" I went to my favorite pen shop on the internet, which is Jet Pens, and I started researching other small pens, and I found five or six that I really like.

    "content_text": "About a year ago, security researcher Sam Curry bought his mother a Subaru, on the condition that, at some point in the near future, she let him hack it.\nIt took Curry until last November, when he was home for Thanksgiving, to begin examining the 2023 Impreza's internet-connected features and start looking for ways to exploit them. Sure enough, he and a researcher working with him online, Shubham Shah, soon discovered vulnerabilities in a Subaru web portal that let them hijack the ability to unlock the car, honk its horn, and start its ignition, reassigning control of those features to any phone or computer they chose.\nMost disturbing for Curry, though, was that they found they could also track the Subaru's location—not merely where it was at the moment but also where it had been for the entire year that his mother had owned it. The map of the car’s whereabouts was so accurate and detailed, Curry says, that he was able to see her doctor visits, the homes of the friends she visited, even which exact parking space his mother parked in every time she went to church.\n“You can retrieve at least a year's worth of location history for the car, where it's pinged precisely, sometimes multiple times a day,” Curry says. “Whether somebody's cheating on their wife or getting an abortion or part of some political group, there are a million scenarios where you could weaponize this against someone.”\nCurry and Shah today revealed in a blog post their method for hacking and tracking millions of Subarus, which they believe would have allowed hackers to target any of the company's vehicles equipped with its digital features known as Starlink in the US, Canada, or Japan. Vulnerabilities they found in a Subaru website intended for the company's staff allowed them to hijack an employee's account to both reassign control of cars’ Starlink features and also access all the vehicle location data available to employees, including the car’s location every time its engine started, as shown in their video below.\nCurry and Shah reported their findings to Subaru in late November, and Subaru quickly patched its Starlink security flaws. But the researchers warn that the Subaru web vulnerabilities are just the latest in a long series of similar web-based flaws they and other security researchers working with them have found that have affected well over a dozen carmakers, including Acura, Genesis, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Kia, Toyota, and many others. There’s little doubt, they say, that similarly serious hackable bugs exist in other auto companies' web tools that have yet to be discovered.\nIn Subaru's case, in particular, they also point out that their discovery hints at how pervasively those with access to Subaru's portal can track its customers' movements, a privacy issue that will last far longer than the web vulnerabilities that exposed it. “The thing is, even though this is patched, this functionality is still going to exist for Subaru employees,” Curry says. “It's just normal functionality that an employee can pull up a year's worth of your location history.”\nWhen WIRED reached out to Subaru for comment on Curry and Shah's findings, a spokesperson responded in a statement that “after being notified by independent security researchers, [Subaru] discovered a vulnerability in its Starlink service that could potentially allow a third party to access Starlink accounts. The vulnerability was immediately closed and no customer information was ever accessed without authorization.”\nThe Subaru spokesperson also confirmed to WIRED that “there are employees at Subaru of America, based on their job relevancy, who can access location data.\" The company offered as an example that employees have that access to share a vehicle's location with first responders in the case when a collision is detected. “All these individuals receive proper training and are required to sign appropriate privacy, security, and NDA agreements as needed,” Subaru's statement added. “These systems have security monitoring solutions in place which are continually evolving to meet modern cyber threats.”\nResponding to Subaru's example of notifying first responders about a collision, Curry notes that would hardly require a year's worth of location history. The company didn't respond to WIRED asking how far back it keeps customers' location histories and makes them available to employees.\nShah and Curry's research that led them to the discovery of Subaru's vulnerabilities began when they found that Curry's mother's Starlink app connected to the domain SubaruCS.com, which they realized was an administrative domain for employees. Scouring that site for security flaws, they found that they could reset employees' passwords simply by guessing their email address, which gave them the ability to take over any employee's account whose email they could find. The password reset functionality did ask for answers to two security questions, but they found that those answers were checked with code that ran locally in a user's browser, not on Subaru's server, allowing the safeguard to be easily bypassed. “There were really multiple systemic failures that led to this,” Shah says.\nThe two researchers say they found the email address for a Subaru Starlink developer on LinkedIn, took over the employee's account, and immediately found that they could use that staffer's access to look up any Subaru owner by last name, zip code, email address, phone number, or license plate to access their Starlink configurations. In seconds, they could then reassign control of the Starlink features of that user's vehicle, including the ability to remotely unlock the car, honk its horn, start its ignition, or locate it, as shown in the video below.\nThose vulnerabilities alone, for drivers, present serious theft and safety risks. Curry and Shah point out that a hacker could have targeted a victim for stalking or theft, looked up someone's vehicle's location, then unlocked their car at any time—though a thief would have to somehow also use a separate technique to disable the car's immobilizer, the component that prevents it from being driven away without a key.\nThose car hacking and tracking techniques alone are far from unique. Last summer, Curry and another researcher, Neiko Rivera, demonstrated to WIRED that they could pull off a similar trick with any of millions of vehicles sold by Kia. Over the prior two years, a larger group of researchers, of which Curry and Shah are a part, discovered web-based security vulnerabilities that affected cars sold by Acura, BMW, Ferrari, Genesis, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Rolls Royce, and Toyota.\nMore unusual in Subaru's case, Curry and Shah say, is that they were able to access fine-grained, historical location data for Subarus going back at least a year. Subaru may in fact collect multiple years of location data, but Curry and Shah tested their technique only on Curry's mother, who had owned her Subaru for about a year.\nCurry argues that Subaru's extensive location tracking is a particularly disturbing demonstration of the car industry's lack of privacy safeguards around its growing collection of personal data on drivers. “It's kind of bonkers,” he says. “There's an expectation that a Google employee isn't going to be able to just go through your emails in Gmail, but there's literally a button on Subaru's admin panel that lets an employee view location history.”\nThe two researchers’ work contributes to a growing sense of concern over the enormous amount of location data that car companies collect. In December, information a whistleblower provided to the German hacker collective the Chaos Computer Computer and Der Spiegel revealed that Cariad, a software company that partners with Volkswagen, had left detailed location data for 800,000 electric vehicles publicly exposed online. Privacy researchers at the Mozilla Foundation in September warned in a report that “modern cars are a privacy nightmare,” noting that 92 percent give car owners little to no control over the data they collect, and 84 percent reserve the right to sell or share your information. (Subaru tells WIRED that it “does not sell location data.”)\n“While we worried that our doorbells and watches that connect to the internet might be spying on us, car brands quietly entered the data business by turning their vehicles into powerful data-gobbling machines,” Mozilla's report reads.\nCurry and Shah's discovery of Subaru's security vulnerabilities in its tracking demonstrate a particularly egregious exposure of that data—but also a privacy problem that's hardly less disturbing now that the vulnerabilities are patched, says Robert Herrell, the executive director of the Consumer Federation of California, which has sought to create legislation for limiting car's data tracking.\n“It seems like there are a bunch of employees at Subaru that have a scary amount of detailed information,” Herrell says. “People are being tracked in ways that they have no idea are happening.”\nUpdate 4:23 pm EST, January 23, 2025: The article's subheadline has been updated to clarify the scope of the researcher's work.",

    "content_text": "Over the weekend, I went to DC to meet with all of the right-wing influencers and content creators who made President Donald Trump’s 2024 win possible. They were everywhere.\nThe 2024 election was the influencer election and inauguration was no different: There were dozens of pre- and post-inaugural parties and balls this weekend, as well as the big event itself. Theo Von sat in front of Jake and Logan Paul under the Capitol rotunda (well, until the podcaster’s chair collapsed). Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, and Brett Cooper walked the Turning Point USA red carpet and posed for selfies with fans. Jessic Reed Kraus, writer of the HouseInhabit newsletter, hung out with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the Make America Healthy Again ball Monday night.\nIn August, I published a guide on the Republican and Democratic influencers shaping the 2024 election. The influencers and content creators still matter, and they will be communicating and guiding policy decisions for years to come.\nWelcome to Trump 2.0, where these creators have the ears not only of their audiences but of the president as well. Here are some of the ones to keep an eye on over the next four years.\nThe Podcasters and Streamers\nThe 2024 election was the breakout cycle for podcasters in politics. Most of the shows Trump went on catered to the manosphere, a loose network of creators who push misogynistic, racist, and pro-male ideology online. This includes people like Joe Rogan, Andrew Schulz, the Paul brothers, and Adin Ross, who shared their Trump interviews with millions and millions of their fans. There’s a second branch too, made up of creators who have branded themselves as the intellectual wing of the modern Republican party, like Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, and Lex Fridman. Fridman’s YouTube podcast reaches millions of viewers every week. Shapiro’s show is one of the most popular ones on Spotify.\nThese podcasters have amplified Trump and his agenda with very little, if any, pushback. They will likely be key in rallying support for Trump administration decisions.\nI spoke briefly with Shapiro on Sunday night, asking what comes next for the GOP and podcasting. “The power continues to grow,” he said. “Legacy media's completely blown itself out. We're focused on expanding, not only our brand, but there's so many other brands that need expansion, I think that it's gonna be a very rich time for the podcast industry.”\nThe Meme Pages\nDC Draino, the Typical Liberal, RagingAmericans, and Snowflaketears are some of the largest pro-MAGA meme pages on Instagram. Combined, these accounts have over 6 million followers. They act as conduit between GOP leadership priorities and platforms like X and Instagram.\nThink of their accounts as news aggregators for people who otherwise may not be consuming it.\nThe Organizers\nWhile the Democrats worked with influencers over the last election cycle too, no PAC or campaign organized them as effectively and efficiently as the right. Because of Turning Point USA and its leader, Charlie Kirk, many of the GOP’s most popular creators see each other at least a few times a year at the organization’s summits and trainings. According to interviews with some of the right’s top organizers, that infrastructure is only going to grow over the next four years. The organizers themselves have also become influencers to watch.\nI wrote about an influencer party (and victory lap) hosted over Inauguration weekend that was put on by CJ Pearson and Raquel Debono. Pearson, a conservative creator with more than 500,000 X followers, cochairs the Republican National Committee’s youth advisory council. He’s played a key role in the party’s adoption of influencers and is planning additional trainings with organizations like the Heritage Foundation.\nDebono, the chief marketing officer at Date Right, the conservative dating platform, boasts tens of thousands of followers of her own. More importantly, however, she’s become the premiere party host for young people on the right, engineering a fratty, downtown club scene for young Republicans. Trump campaign adviser Alex Bruesewitz was key in striking many of the creator partnerships that won Trump millions of views.\nThese events and collabs not only teach creators how to better communicate their values, but define the cultural vibe and set the tone for right-wing content.\nThe Substackers\nMemes and three-hour podcast interviews are powerful tools, but they’re not for everyone. For some audiences, including older ones, reading is their favorite means of consuming information. Substack has found a home with these users, replacing the 2000s political blogosphere.\nJessica Reed Kraus runs the HouseInhabit Substack, which touts nearly 500,000 subscribers. Throughout the 2024 election cycle, she aligned herself closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Make America Healthy Again movement. She’s become one of the most influential right-leaning writers who primarily caters to women.\nAnd there’s Curtis Yarvin, the techno monarchist philosopher king of Substack. Yarvin threw his own inauguration weekend party that drew “2016-era MAGA figures” like Jack Posobiec and Red Scare podcasters Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova. Yarvin’s influence among the powerful Silicon Valley oligarchs and the irony-poisoned former leftists like Nekrasova positions him as a powerful intellectual and cultural force under the new administration–especially since Vice President JD Vance is a fan of his work.\nAll of these creators and influencers, regardless of their platform, will be an instrumental part of the Trump White House’s media apparatus. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has even suggested that they may be invited to join the legacy media for daily press briefings. Unlike traditional journalists, though, they are not bound to any ethical guidelines. We’ve already seen the lengths to which many of these people will go for views. How far will they go for Trump?\nThe Chatroom\nSo much happened this week. The Department of Government Efficiency is now a real thing. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined other artificial intelligence leaders to announce a new $500 billion project called Stargate at the White House on Tuesday. More than 1,500 January 6 insurrectionists received pardons or sentence commutations.\nWhat struck you the most? What are you worried about? Does anything excite you?\nYou can leave a comment or send your thoughts to mail@wired.com.\nWIRED Reads\nThe Menswear Guy on What’s Now and What’s Next for the MAGA Aesthetic: My colleague Vittoria Elliott spoke with Derek Guy, the popular menswear influencer on X, critiquing the fits tech execs like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk wore to the inauguration on Monday.\nA Capitol Rioter’s Son Is Terrified About His Father’s Release: On day one, Trump pardoned and commuted the sentences of nearly 1,600 individuals involved in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Jackson Reffitt, who reported his father’s involvement in the attack to the FBI, now lives in fear of what his father might do next.\nHow Meta Tried to Lure TikTok Users to Instagram: In the days before TikTok was set to go dark, Meta ran a ton of ads and released a flood of new features to win over the embattled app’s user base.\nWant more?

We're focused on expanding, not only our brand, but there's so many other brands that need expansion, I think that it's gonna be a very rich time for the podcast industry.”</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">The Meme Pages</h2><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>DC Draino, the Typical Liberal, RagingAmericans, and Snowflaketears</strong> are some of the largest pro-MAGA meme pages on Instagram. Combined, these accounts have over 6 million followers. They act as conduit between GOP leadership priorities and platforms like X and Instagram.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Think of their accounts as news aggregators for people who otherwise may not be consuming it.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">The Organizers</h2><p class=\"paywall\">While the Democrats worked with influencers over the last election cycle too, no PAC or campaign organized them as effectively and efficiently as the right. Because of Turning Point USA and its leader, <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong>, many of the GOP’s most popular creators see each other at least a few times a year at the organization’s summits and trainings. According to interviews with some of the right’s top organizers, that infrastructure is only going to grow over the next four years. The organizers themselves have also become influencers to watch.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/maga-influencers-inauguration-victory-lap/\">an influencer party (and victory lap) hosted over Inauguration weekend</a> that was put on by <strong>CJ Pearson</strong> and <strong>Raquel Debono</strong>. Pearson, a conservative creator with more than 500,000 X followers, cochairs the Republican National Committee’s youth advisory council. He’s played a key role in the party’s adoption of influencers and is planning additional trainings with organizations like the Heritage Foundation.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "He’s not a famous name in the wider world, but copyright lawyer Mark Lemley is equal parts revered and feared within certain tech circles. TechDirt recently described him as a “Lebron James/Michael Jordan”-level legal thinker. A professor at Stanford, counsel at an IP-focused law firm in the Bay Area, and one of the 10 most-cited legal scholars of all time, Lemley is exactly the kind of person Silicon Valley heavyweights want on their side. Meta, however, has officially lost him.\nEarlier this month, Lemley announced he was no longer going to defend the tech giant in Kadrey v. Meta, a lawsuit filed by a group of authors who allege the tech giant violated copyright law by training its AI tools on their books without their permission. The fact that he quit is a big deal. I wondered if it had something to do with how the case was going—but then I checked social media.\nLemley said on LinkedIn and Bluesky that he still believes Meta should win the lawsuit, and he wasn’t bowing out because of the merits of the case. Instead, he’d “fired” Meta because of what he characterized as the company and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s “descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness.” The move came on the heels of major policy shifts at Meta, including changes to its hateful conduct rules that now allow users to call gay and trans people “mentally ill.”\nIn a phone conversation, Lemley explained what motivated his decision to quit, and where he sees the broader legal landscape on AI and copyright going, including his suspicion that OpenAI may settle with The New York Times.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nKate Knibbs: Could you go into more detail about how you arrived at your decision to quit representing Meta? What was the deciding factor?\nMark Lemley: I am very troubled by the direction in which the country is going, and I am particularly troubled that a number of folks in the tech industry seem to be willing to go along with it, no matter how extreme it gets. A number of policy changes struck me as things that I would not personally want to be associated with, from the full-throated endorsement of Trump, to the systematic cutting-back on protections for LGBTQ people, to the elimination of DEI programs. All of this is a pattern, I think, that seems to be following what we saw with Elon Musk a couple of years ago. We've seen where that path leads, and it's not somewhere good. Mark Zuckerberg is, of course, free to do whatever he wants to do, but I decided that that wasn't something I wanted to be associated with.\nDid Meta make an effort to keep you? Did Zuckerberg say anything to you?\nI’ve not had any conversation with Mark Zuckerberg, ever. But any internal conversations that were had is something I probably should not talk about.\nEspecially right now, it’s apparent that Zuckerberg isn’t the only tech mogul aligning himself with Trump. As you mentioned, Elon Musk comes to mind. But there are a lot of very powerful people in Silicon Valley who are pivoting hard towards MAGA policies. Do you have a list, now, of people you’d say no to representing? How are you approaching this?\nI did think Zuckerberg and Musk have been particularly egregious in their behavior. But one of the nice things about being in the position I'm in—having a full-time job teaching rather than practicing law—is that I have probably greater freedom than a lot of people to say I don't need to take that money. Do I have a list? No, absolutely not.\nBut if you decide that the thing to do with your brand is to associate it with moves towards fascism, that is a decision that ought to have consequences. One of the challenges that a lot of people have is they don't feel that they can speak up, because it's going to cost them personally. So I think it's all the more important for people who can bear that cost to do so.\nWhat has the reaction been like?\nWhen I made this as a personal decision, I decided I should say something about it on social media, both because I thought it was important to explain why I was doing it, and also to explain that it wasn't a function of anything in the case, or my views about the case. I had no idea what I was in for, in terms of the reaction. It's been quite remarkable and overwhelmingly positive. There are plenty of trolls who think I'm an idiot and a libtard. But so far, no death threats, which is a welcome improvement from the past.\nHave you heard from people who might follow in your footsteps?\nThis struck such a nerve, and there are obviously a lot of people who feel that they don't have the power to tell Meta or anyone else to go away, or to stand up for things that they think, and that's unfortunate.\nI know your position remains that Meta is still on the right in its AI copyright disputes. But are there any cases in which you think the plaintiffs have a stronger argument?\nThe strongest arguments are the ones where the output of a work ends up being substantially similar to a particular copyrighted input. Most of the time, when that happens, it happens by accident or because they didn't do a good enough job trying to fix the problems that lead to it. But sometimes, it might be unavoidable. Turns out, it’s hard to purge all references to Mickey Mouse from your AI dataset, for instance. If people want to try to generate a Mickey Mouse image, it's often possible to do something that looks like Mickey Mouse. So there are a set of issues that might create copyright problems, but they're mostly not the ones currently being litigated.\nThe one exception to that is the UMG v. Anthropic case, because at least early on, earlier versions of Anthropic would generate the song lyrics for songs in the output. That's a problem. The current status of that case is they've put safeguards in place to try to prevent that from happening, and the parties have sort of agreed that, pending the resolution of the case, those safeguards are sufficient, so they're no longer seeking a preliminary injunction.\nAt the end of the day, the harder question for the AI companies is not is it legal to engage in training? It’s what do you do when your AI generates output that is too similar to a particular work?\nDo you expect the majority of these cases to go to trial, or do you see settlements on the horizon?\nThere may well be some settlements. Where I expect to see settlements is with big players who either have large swaths of content or content that's particularly valuable. The New York Times might end up with a settlement, and with a licensing deal, perhaps where OpenAI pays money to use New York Times content.\nThere's enough money at stake that we're probably going to get at least some judgments that set the parameters. The class-action plaintiffs, my sense is they have stars in their eyes. There are lots of class actions, and my guess is that the defendants are going to be resisting those and hoping to win on summary judgment. It's not obvious that they go to trial. The Supreme Court in the Google v. Oracle case nudged fair-use law very strongly in the direction of being resolved on summary judgment, not in front of a jury. I think the AI companies are going to try very hard to get those cases decided on summary judgment.\nWhy would it be better for them to win on summary judgment versus a jury verdict?\nIt's quicker and it's cheaper than going to trial. And AI companies are worried that they're not going to be viewed as popular, that a lot of people are going to think, Oh, you made a copy of the work that should be illegal and not dig into the details of the fair-use doctrine.\nThere have been lots of deals between AI companies and media outlets, content providers, and other rights holders. Most of the time, these deals appear to be more about search than foundational models, or at least that’s how it’s been described to me. In your opinion, is licensing content to be used in AI search engines—where answers are sourced by retrieval augmented generation or RAG—something that’s legally obligatory? Why are they doing it this way?\nIf you're using retrieval augmented generation on targeted, specific content, then your fair-use argument gets more challenging. It's much more likely that AI-generated search is going to generate text taken directly from one particular source in the output, and that's much less likely to be a fair use. I mean, it could be—but the risky area is that it’s much more likely to be competing with the original source material. If instead of directing people to a New York Times story, I give them my AI prompt that uses RAG to take the text straight out of that New York Times story, that does seem like a substitution that could harm the New York Times. Legal risk is greater for the AI company.\nWhat do you want people to know about the generative AI copyright fights that they might not already know, or they might have been misinformed about?\nThe thing that I hear most often that's wrong as a technical matter is this concept that these are just plagiarism machines. All they're doing is taking my stuff and then grinding it back out in the form of text and responses. I hear a lot of artists say that, and I hear a lot of lay people say that, and it's just not right as a technical matter. You can decide if generative AI is good or bad. You can decide it's lawful or unlawful. But it really is a fundamentally new thing we have not experienced before. The fact that it needs to train on a bunch of content to understand how sentences work, how arguments work, and to understand various facts about the world doesn't mean it's just kind of copying and pasting things or creating a collage. It really is generating things that nobody could expect or predict, and it's giving us a lot of new content. I think that's important and valuable.",

    "content_text": "When I walk into Jen Easterly’s office on a bright January day in Arlington, Virginia, I’m greeted by a giant shark head lurking on the floor. I instantly spot a Rubik’s Cube—an Easterly hallmark—emblazoned with the logo of the organization she’s run for the past three and a half years—the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which President Donald Trump created during his first term.\nEasterly, who is 56 years old, jumps to her feet to greet me. The first thing that hits me is her denim pants, which have a dragon on one leg and a serpent on the other. Then she launches into updates on CISA’s animated “Secure Our World” video series and, in the same breath, laments that she hasn’t had time for a private guitar lesson in weeks. Seemingly a regular day on the job for her, except for one thing. As of January 20, Inauguration Day, Easterly’s time at CISA would be over. Trump had fired the agency’s first director, Chris Krebs, after CISA refused to question the integrity of the 2020 election, and Easterly now says she wasn’t asked to stay. Rumors are swirling that CISA programs—or even the entire agency—may soon be on Trump’s chopping block.\nThe timing couldn’t be worse for the nation to lose its top cybersecurity cop. A Beijing-linked group called Salt Typhoon spent months last year rampaging through American telecoms and siphoning call logs, recordings, text messages, and even potentially location data. Many experts have called it the biggest hack in US telecom history. Easterly and her agency unknowingly detected Salt Typhoon activity in federal networks early last year—warning signs that ultimately sped up the unraveling of the espionage campaign.\nThe work of banishing Chinese spies from victim networks isn’t over, but the walls are already closing in on CISA. Trump's nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, told a senate committee last week that CISA needs to be “smaller” and “more nimble.” And a day after the inauguration, all members of the Cyber Safety Review Board—who were appointed by Easterly and were actively investigating the Salt Typhoon breaches—were let go.\nWhen Easterly officially became the agency’s second director, in 2021, the government was still reeling from a different blockbuster hack—SolarWinds. Kremlin-backed intruders had compromised widely used software to infiltrate the networks of US agencies and other targets. Helping US institutions defend themselves became an even more urgent and daunting project. CISA doesn’t enforce laws or collect intelligence; its job is to evangelize digital security measures and offer free services, so institutions can see what they need to do to not get hacked or—more realistically—get hacked less badly. Easterly got to work building relationships across the federal government and with state and local officials, corporate executives, and utility managers. In crises like the Salt Typhoon campaign, these relationships are crucial to quickly containing the damage.\nIt takes a determined person, and perhaps a charismatic one, to build rapport with such a wide-ranging group of people. Easterly has the background for it: She has worked in the Army (with multiple deployments), the National Security Agency, and the National Security Council under Barack Obama, and she spent nearly five years in charge of Morgan Stanley’s global cybersecurity. She also helped establish US Cyber Command within the Department of Defense. Somehow, though, she’s chill. To break the ice, and probably to make an impression, Easterly has leaned into her passions while in office, cubing and jamming with executives and utility operators around the country. And, yes, there’s her eclectic style—high fashion (by cybersecurity standards, anyway) mixed with bell-bottoms and Birkenstocks—but also her quiet, intense obsession with trying to solve the puzzle that is digital defense.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity, combining on-camera and off-camera portions. Check out WIRED’s YouTube channel for the video.\nYou’re in your last days as the director of CISA. How's it going?\nIt's a little bittersweet.\nWhy are you leaving?\nWell, at the end of the day, I'm a Senate-confirmed political appointee. We serve at the pleasure of the president. I've not been asked to stay.\nThere are signs that the Trump administration may be hostile to some of CISA’s goals. Do you think the agency has proven it's valuable?\nWe are America's cyberdefense agency, but our budget is less than $3 billion. I think the American people are getting an incredible return on investment. Anybody who looks at it will see that there's been an enormous amount of progress made in reducing risk to the critical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day. We're talking water, power, transportation, communication, finance. It's not a political or partisan issue, and these threats are only getting more complicated, more dangerous. Any stepping back of what we've put in place will be to the detriment of the safety and security of the American people.\nOne threat that’s top of mind is Salt Typhoon. How have past foreign espionage campaigns, like Russia’s SolarWinds attacks, informed the work you all are doing?\nWhat we saw in December 2020, with the revelations about the Russian intrusions into US federal government networks, as well as businesses around the world, was a pretty sophisticated supply-chain espionage operation. I would say the bumper sticker was to finally allow CISA to manage the .gov federal digital assets as one enterprise, not as a disparate tribe of a hundred separate departments and agencies. It's still a work in progress, but what we've put in place across the government over the past three and a half years has given us enormous visibility and has allowed us to detect intrusions much more rapidly, to be able to remediate them and to get ahead of future intrusions.\nIt’s concerning how difficult it seems to have been for the telecoms to eradicate the Chinese hackers from their networks. Has there been progress in terms of that transparency and insight you're talking about?\nAfter the revelations of these breaches, we stood up what's called a unified coordination group. So we're responding, the FBI is investigating, folks like the National Security Agency are using what we see in the intelligence to understand the extent and the depth of this intrusion. And we're coming together to work with the victims. We've been doing that for months. This has unfortunately been out in the press a lot—\nI would say fortunately!\nAnything that gets out there has the downside of having adversaries change their tactics. So, while I think the transparency to consumers is important, it also makes it more difficult to then find these actors within the network. I don't expect it to be remediated in the short term.\nWhat about in the long term?\nEverybody should assume that our adversaries, in particular China, are attempting to go after our critical infrastructure. The private sector, they are on the front lines of this fight, because they own and operate the vast majority of our critical infrastructure. It's why companies need to put collaboration over self-preservation.\nI want a future where something like a ransomware attack is a shocking anomaly. Where damaging software vulnerabilities exploited by nation-state actors are as infrequent as plane crashes. A world where the technology that we've come to rely on every hour of every day is first and foremost secure.\nIt feels like hackers always find new ways to get where they want to go. Can you win at defense?\nI mean, you're right. Defense is hard. I say that as America's cyber head goalie. And that's why it has to be a team. As much as we work to hunt for and eradicate Chinese actors, our partners need to hold those actors accountable, whether that's through offensive cyber capabilities or indictments or sanctions. But, yes, we're on the defensive side, and it's a challenge.\nRight now is a very scary and precarious time in cyberspace.\nI spent a lot of time in counterterrorism, and people would often say, “What keeps you up at night?” But it's really not what keeps me up at night. It's all about what gets you up in the morning. I love my team. I love the mission. Not every day is the best day ever, but you work through the issues, you stay resilient, you stay focused.\nProbably a necessary attitude for this type of work. But I just have to be that guy who asks you one more time: What keeps you up at night?\nA major conflict in Asia—the potential invasion or blockade of Taiwan by the People’s Republic of China—could have very real consequences here in the US. You could see pipelines and water being affected, telecommunications being severed, rail lines, power. That is all part of a very deliberate effort by the People’s Republic of China to incite what they call “societal panic” and to deter our ability to marshal military might and citizen will. We have to acknowledge that disruption may occur.\nIs the public paying too much attention to espionage campaigns like Salt Typhoon? Should we all be more worried about threats to critical infrastructure, like China’s Volt Typhoon?\nWe are very focused overall on PRC cyber actors. CISA is one of the few agencies in the government that has been able to find both Volt Typhoon within critical infrastructure as well as Salt Typhoon. In fact, it was our work several months ago to find Salt Typhoon that then led to law enforcement identifying virtual private servers that were being leased by the adversaries, and then that unraveled the wider campaign.\nYou and I have talked before about how Ukraine has faced years of punishing digital attacks and, of course, an ongoing kinetic war with Russia. CISA has partnered for a few years now with its counterpart agency in Ukraine. Do you have concerns that the Trump administration won't prioritize that relationship?\nUkraine is under active assault by a very sophisticated threat actor. What we are learning from how they are dealing with those attacks actually helps us understand and mitigate similar threats to our own infrastructure. Cyber is a borderless space, and what our foreign partners see can absolutely benefit us. We need to ensure that all of us—from the vendors that create technology to companies that buy technology to citizens that consume technology—recognize our shared role in a collective defense of cyberspace and critical infrastructure.\nDo you feel that there are too many cooks in the US federal cybersecurity kitchen? Has that been an issue?\nIt really has not. A lot of people have asked that question, but when the SolarWinds incident occurred I was looking at it as both the cyber policy lead for the Biden-Harris transition team and, perhaps more importantly, from my day job at Morgan Stanley. One advisory came out from CISA that was very SolarWinds-specific. We didn't have SolarWinds in our infrastructure. Another one came from NSA that was focused on VMware, and we did have VMware in our systems. It was not clear how these things were connected. And then you would see an FBI private-sector notice about something else. At this point I've already been in government for 27 years. I'd been in the military, the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, the White House. It's like, I know this. I thought I understood the government. And I couldn't make sense of what the government was trying to tell us about this Russian espionage campaign. It was one of the motivating things about coming to CISA. How do we bring together the federal cyber ecosystem?\nThe relationships with NSA, FBI, and CISA have never been better. Some of that is personalities, but I think we have actually developed institutional connective tissue, so that it will last. It's very, very clear what CISA’s role is. Now, you often talk about, what does the National Security Council do? What does the Office of the National Cyber Director do? I think we've sorted out the relationships at that level with policy and strategy, but really at the operational level where CISA lives, those relationships across the federal cyber ecosystem I think have never been better.\nYou said that there is unfinished business as you prepare to leave CISA. Where do you wish you could have done more?\nThere’s a lot of unfinished business. We have made an impact through our ransomware vulnerability warning pilot and our pre-ransomware notification initiative, and I’m really proud of that, because we work on preventing somebody from having their worst day. But ransomware is still a problem. We have been laser-focused on PRC cyber actors. That will continue to be a huge problem. I'm really proud of where we are, but there's much, much more work to be done. There are things that I think we can continue driving, that the next administration, I hope, will look at, because, frankly, cybersecurity is a national security issue.\nI have to ask you, there are rumors: Are you or are you not going on tour when you leave CISA?\nYou know, I certainly hope to. I played piano and guitar when I was young, but I started taking up electric guitar, and that has become my passion, my obsession. So my big postretirement plan several years from now is to start a bar in lower Manhattan, to have a band. We're going to do magic. We're going to do improv. I'm going to be the bartender.\nAnd will there be Rubik's Cubes at every table?\nThere will be Rubik's Cubes. I'm obsessed with the Rubik's Cube. When I was 11 these things were introduced across the world, and I was a huge puzzler and a video game person. I learned how to solve it, and then I would go to toy stores—I was this little kid with pigtails—and say, “Hey, if I can solve this in less than two minutes, will you give me a free one?” So I was able to amass this whole set of them.\nYou must see some sort of connection between that and your day job.\nErnő Rubik, who invented the thing, said something like, if you are curious, you will find puzzles around you. And if you are determined, you will solve them. And when I think about the incredible technical talent that we have here at CISA, it’s the intellectual curiosity, it’s the hacker mindset, it’s the problem solver. But it's also the determination, the relentless drive to solve the most complicated problems out there.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

Trump had <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/trump-fires-christopher-krebs-cisa/\">fired</a> the agency’s first director, Chris Krebs, after CISA refused to question the integrity of the 2020 election, and Easterly now says she wasn’t asked to stay. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cisa-cuts-trump-2/\">Rumors are swirling</a> that CISA programs—or even <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/14/rand-paul-kneecap-cisa-00189698\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/14/rand-paul-kneecap-cisa-00189698\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/14/rand-paul-kneecap-cisa-00189698\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the entire agency</a>—may soon be on Trump’s chopping block.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The timing couldn’t be worse for the nation to lose its top cybersecurity cop. A Beijing-linked group <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/senators-warn-pentagon-salt-typhoon-china-hacking/\">called Salt Typhoon</a> spent months last year rampaging through American telecoms and siphoning call logs, recordings, text messages, and even potentially location data. Many experts have called it the biggest hack in US telecom history. Easterly and her agency unknowingly detected Salt Typhoon activity in federal networks early last year—warning signs that ultimately sped up the unraveling of the espionage campaign.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">The work of banishing Chinese spies from victim networks isn’t over, but the walls are already closing in on CISA. Trump's nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, told a senate committee last week that CISA needs to be “smaller” and “more nimble.” And a day after the inauguration, all members of the Cyber Safety Review Board—who were appointed by Easterly and were actively investigating the Salt Typhoon breaches—were let go.</p><p class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe iDXPAN callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">When Easterly officially <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/biden-cybersecurity-inglis-easterly-cisa-nsa/\">became the agency’s second director</a>, in 2021, the government was still reeling from a different blockbuster hack—<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-untold-story-of-solarwinds-the-boldest-supply-chain-hack-ever/\">SolarWinds</a>. Kremlin-backed intruders had compromised widely used software to infiltrate the networks of US agencies and other targets. Helping US institutions defend themselves became an even more urgent and daunting project. CISA doesn’t enforce laws or collect intelligence; its job is to evangelize digital security measures and offer free services, so institutions can see what they need to do to not get hacked or—more realistically—get hacked less badly. Easterly got to work building relationships across the federal government and with state and local officials, corporate executives, and utility managers. In crises like the Salt Typhoon campaign, these relationships are crucial to quickly containing the damage.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">It takes a determined person, and perhaps a charismatic one, to build rapport with such a wide-ranging group of people. Easterly has the background for it: She has worked in the Army (with multiple deployments), the National Security Agency, and the National Security Council under Barack Obama, and she spent nearly five years in charge of Morgan Stanley’s global cybersecurity. She also helped establish US Cyber Command within the Department of Defense. Somehow, though, she’s chill. To break the ice, and probably to make an impression, Easterly has leaned into her passions while in office, cubing and jamming with executives and utility operators around the country. And, yes, there’s her eclectic style—high fashion (by cybersecurity standards, anyway) mixed with bell-bottoms and Birkenstocks—but also her quiet, intense obsession with trying to solve the puzzle that is digital defense.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity, combining on-camera and off-camera portions.

    "content_text": "This prediction is based on several decades of research that my colleagues and I have been undertaking at the University of Oxford to establish what makes people willing to fight and die for their groups. We use a variety of methods, including interviews, surveys, and psychological experiments to collect data from a wide range of groups, such as tribal warriors, armed insurgents, terrorists, conventional soldiers, religious fundamentalists, and violent football fans.\nWe have found that life-changing and group-defining experiences cause our personal and collective identities to become fused together. We call it “identity fusion.” Fused individuals will stop at nothing to advance the interests of their groups, and this applies not only to acts we would applaud as heroic—such as rescuing children from burning buildings or taking a bullet for one’s comrades—but also acts of suicide terrorism.\nFusion is commonly measured by showing people a small circle (representing you) and a big circle (representing your group) and placing pairs of such circles in a sequence so that they overlap to varying degrees: not at all, then just a little bit, then a bit more, and so on until the little circle is completely enclosed in the big circle. Then people are asked which pair of circles best captures their relationship with the group. People who choose the one in which the little circle is inside the big circle are said to be “fused.” Those are people who love their group so much that they will do almost anything to protect it.\nThis isn’t unique to humans. Some species of birds will feign a broken wing to draw a predator away from their fledglings. One species—the superb fairy wren of Australasia—lures predators away from their young by making darting movements and squeaky sounds to imitate the behavior of a delectable mouse. Humans too will typically go to great lengths to protect their genetic relatives, especially their children who (except for identical twins) share more of their genes than other family members. But—unusually in the animal kingdom—humans often go further still by putting themselves in harm’s way to protect groups of genetically unrelated members of the tribe. In ancient prehistory, such tribes were small enough that everyone knew everybody else. These local groups bonded through shared ordeals such as painful initiations, by hunting dangerous animals together, and by fighting bravely on the battlefield.\nNowadays, however, fusion is scaled up to vastly bigger groups, thanks to the ability of the world’s media—including social media—to fill our heads with images of horrendous suffering in faraway regional conflicts.\nWhen I met with one of the former leaders of the terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiyah in Indonesia, he told me he first became radicalized in the 1980s after reading newspaper reports about the treatment of fellow Muslims by Russian soldiers in Afghanistan. Twenty years later, however, nearly a third of American extremists were radicalized via social media feeds, and by 2016 that proportion had risen to about three quarters. Smartphones and immersive reporting shrinks the world to such an extent that forms of shared suffering in face-to-face groups can now be largely recreated and spread to millions of people across thousands of miles at the click of a button.\nFusion based on shared suffering may be powerful, but is not sufficient by itself to motivate violent extremism. Our research suggests that three other ingredients are also necessary to produce the deadly cocktail: outgroup threat, demonization of the enemy, and the belief that peaceful alternatives are lacking. In regions such as Gaza, where the sufferings of civilians are regularly captured on video and shared around the world, it is only natural that rates of fusion among those watching on in horror will increase. If people believe that peaceful solutions are impossible, violent extremism will spiral.\nSurprisingly, however, a remedy may lie in the fusion mechanism itself. Our research has shown that when Muslim and Jewish participants reflect on the sufferings of the outgroup in the Gaza conflict, this has strikingly positive effects on their attitudes toward each other, despite initial feelings of hostility. Investigations into the fusion mechanism also suggest that it can strengthen over time, when people reflect for weeks and months on their shared experiences of suffering. Consequently, there is still time to prevent my bleak prediction for 2025 from being realized.\nAcknowledging shared suffering on both sides of human conflict is often a pathway to imagining peaceful solutions. But first we need to find better ways of ensuring that more people around the world are exposed to the sufferings of those on the other side of the conflicts they are personally most affected by. This may seem like an impossible task in a world where politics is becoming more divisive, foreign policy more parochial, and social media bubbles more impenetrable. However, recognizing the psychology that compels us toward violent or peaceful outcomes is the first step to a solution. How we manage that psychology in 2025 may profoundly influence the kind of world that future generations inherit.",

    "content_text": "Addressing a single executive order from Donald Trump’s voluminous first-day edicts is like singling out one bullet in a burst from an AK-47. But one of them hit me in the gut. That is “Establishing and Implementing the President’s Department of Government Efficiency.’’ The acronym for that name is DOGE (named after a memecoin), and it’s the Elon Musk–led effort to cut government spending by a trillion bucks or two. Though DOGE was, until this week, pitched as an outside body, this move makes it an official part of government—by embedding it in an existing agency that was formerly part of the Office of Management and Budget called the United States Digital Service. The latter will now be known as the US DOGE Service, and its new head will be more tightly connected to the president, reporting to his chief of staff.\nThe new USDS will apparently shift its former laser focus on building cost-efficient and well-designed software for various agencies to a hardcore implementation of the Musk vision. It’s kind of like a government version of a SPAC, the dodgy financial maneuver that launched Truth Social in the public market without ever having to reveal a coherent business plan to underwriters.\nThe order is surprising in a sense because, on its face, DOGE seems more limited than its original super ambitious pitch. This iteration seems more tightly centered on saving money through streamlining and modernizing the government’s massive and messy IT infrastructure. There are big savings to be had, but a handful of zeros short of trillions. As of yet, it’s uncertain whether Musk will become the DOGE administrator. It doesn’t seem big enough for him. (The first USDS director, Mikey Dickerson, jokingly posted on LinkedIn, “I’d like to congratulate Elon Musk on being promoted to my old job.”) But reportedly Musk pushed for this structure as a way to embed DOGE in the White House. I hear that inside the Executive Office Building, there are numerous pink Post-it notes claiming space even beyond USDS’s turf, including one such note on the former chief information officers’ enviable office. So maybe this could be a launch pad for a more sweeping effort that will eliminate whole agencies and change policies. (I was unable to get a White House representative to answer questions, which isn’t surprising considering that there are dozens of other orders that equally beg for explanation.)\nOne thing is clear—this ends United States Digital Service as it previously existed, and marks a new, and maybe perilous era for the USDS, which I have been enthusiastically covering since its inception. The 11-year-old agency sprang out of the high-tech rescue squad salvaging the mess that was Healthcare.gov, the hellish failure of a website that almost tanked the Affordable Care Act. That intrepid team of volunteers set the template for the agency: a small group of coders and designers who used internet-style techniques (cloud not mainframe; the nimble “agile” programming style instead of the outdated “waterfall” technique) to make government tech as nifty as the apps people use on their phones. Its soldiers, often leaving lucrative Silicon Valley jobs, were lured by the prospect of public service. They worked out of the agency’s funky brownstone headquarters on Jackson Place, just north of the White House. The USDS typically took on projects that were mired in centi-million contracts and never completed—delivering superior results within weeks. It would embed its employees in agencies that requested help, being careful to work collaboratively with the lifers in the IT departments. A typical project involved making DOD military medical records interoperable with the different systems used by the VA. The USDS became a darling of the Obama administration, a symbol of its affiliation with cool nerddom.\nDuring the first Trump administration, deft maneuvering kept the USDS afloat—it was the rare Obama initiative that survived. Its second-in-command, Haley Van Dyck, cleverly got buy-in from Trump’s in-house fixer, Jared Kushner. When I went to meet Kushner for an off-the-record talk early in 2017, I ran into Van Dyck in the West Wing; she gave me a conspiratorial nod that things were looking up, at least for the moment. Nonetheless, the four Trump years became a balancing act in sharing the agency’s achievements while somehow staying under the radar. “At Disney amusement parks, they paint things that they want to be invisible with this certain color of green so that people don't notice it in passing,” one USDSer told me. “We specialized in painting ourselves that color of green.” When Covid hit, that became a feat in itself, as USDS worked closely with White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx on gathering statistics—some of which the administration wasn’t eager to publicize.\nBy the end of Trump’s term, the green paint was wearing thin. A source tells me that at one point a Trump political appointee noticed—not happily—that USDS was recruiting at tech conferences for lesbians and minorities, and asked why. The answer was that it was an effective way to find great product managers and designers. The appointee accepted that but asked if, instead of putting “Lesbians Who Tech” on the reimbursement line, could they just say LWT?\nUnder Biden no subterfuge was needed—the USDS thrived. But despite many months of effort, it could not convince Congress to give it permanent funding. With the return of Trump, and his promises to cut government spending, there was reason to think that USDS would evaporate. That’s why the DOGE move is kind of bittersweet—at least it now has more formal recognition and ostensibly will get a reliable budget line.\nHow will the integration work? The executive order mandates that in addition to normal duties the USDS director will also head a temporary organization “dedicated to advancing the President’s 18-month DOGE agenda.” That agenda is not clearly defined, but elsewhere the order speaks of improving the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, systems, and infrastructure. More specific is the mandate to embed four-person teams inside every agency to help realize the DOGE agenda. The order is very explicit that the agency must provide “full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.” Apparently Musk is obsessed with an unprecedented centralization of the data that makes the government go—or not. This somewhat adversarial stance is a dramatic shift from the old USDS MO of working collegially with the lifers inside the agencies.\nDemanding all that data might be a good thing. Clare Martorana, who until last week was the nation’s chief information officer, says that while she saw many victories during her eight years in government tech, making big changes has been tough, in large part because of the difficulty of getting such vital data. “We have budget data that is incomprehensible,” she says. “The agency understands it, but they hide money in all kinds of places, so no one can really get a 100,000-foot view. How many open positions do they have? What are the skill sets? What are their top contracts? When are they renegotiating their most important contracts? How much do they spend on operations and maintenance versus R&D or innovation? You should know all these things.” If DOGE gets that information and uses it well, it could be transformational. “Through self-reporting, we spend $120 billion on IT,” she says “If we found all the hidden money and shadow IT, it's $200, $300, maybe $500 billion. We lose a lot of money on technology we buy stupidly, and we don't deliver services to the American public that they deserve.” So this Trump effort could be a great thing? “I’m trying very hard to be optimistic about it,” says Martorana. The USDS’s outgoing director, Mina Hsiang, is also trying to be upbeat. “I think there's a tremendous opportunity,” she says. “ I don't know what [DOGE] will do with it, but I hope that they listen to a lot of great folks who are there.”\nOn the other hand, those four-person teams could be a blueprint for mayhem. Up until now, USDS would send only engineers and designers into agencies, and their focus was to build things and hopefully set an example for the full-timers to do work like they do at Google or Amazon. The EO dictates only one engineer in a typical four-person team, joined by a lawyer (not known for building stuff), an HR person (known for firing people), and a “team lead” whose job description sounds like a political enforcer: “implementing the president’s DOGE Agenda.” I know that’s a dark view, but Elon Musk —and his new boss—are no strangers to clearing out a workplace. Maybe they’ll figure AI can do things better.\nWhichever way it goes, the original Obama-era vibes of the USDS may forever be stilled—to be superseded by a different kind of idealist in MAGA garb. As one insider told me, “USDS leadership is pretty ill equipped to navigate the onslaught of these DOGE guys, and they are going to get the shit kicked out of them.” Though not perfect, the USDS has by dint of hard work, mad skills, and corny idealism, made a difference. Was there really a need to embed the DOGE experiment into an agency that was doing good? And what are the odds that on July 4, 2026, when the “temporary” DOGE experiment is due to end, the USDS will sunset as well? At best, the new initiative might help unravel the near intractable train wreck that is government IT. But at worst, the integration will be like a greedy brain worm wreaking havoc on its host.\nTime Travel\nIn August 2014, I chronicled how the health care rescue team morphed into the USDS, attending a recruiting session where US chief technology officer Todd Park courted workers from the Valley’s most glamorous and lucrative companies.\n“We have a window of opportunity—within this government, under this president—to make a huge difference,” Park says.\nPark wants to move government IT into the open source, cloud-based, rapid-iteration environment that is second nature to the crowd considering his pitch tonight. The president has given reformers like him leave, he told them, “to blow everything the fuck up and make it radically better.” This means taking on big-pocketed federal contractors, risk-averse bureaucrats, and politicians who may rail at overruns but thrive on contributions from those benefiting from the waste. It also will require streamlined regulations from both the executive and legislative branches. But instead of picking fights, Park wants to win by showing potential foes the undeniable superiority of a modern approach. He needs these coders to make it happen, to form what he calls a Star Wars-style Rebel Alliance, a network of digital special forces teams. He can’t lure them with stock options, but he does offer a compelling opportunity: a chance to serve their country and improve the lives of millions of their fellow citizens.\n“We’re looking for the best people on the planet,” he said. “We have a window of opportunity—right the fuck now—within this government, under this president, to make a huge difference. Drop everything—and help the United States of America!”\nAsk Me One Thing\nJesse asks, “Now that Trump is all about crypto, will it finally hit the mainstream?”\nThanks for asking, Jesse. We all know that the crypto community went for Trump big-time, a classic case of voting with their wallets. The triumphalist cheers during inauguration weekend reflected their optimism that, with a friend in the White House and the wicked witch of the blockchain—SEC chair Gary Gensler—booted from his post, a golden age of crypto was inevitable. But to date, tough regulation isn’t the biggest reason that crypto hasn’t hit the mainstream. Two factors have held it back. Besides an investment vehicle, it doesn’t have utility for most people. And too many scams have made crypto speculation a risky business.\nSo it was unwelcome, to say the least, that just before the Crypto Ball—the industry’s celebration of its new hero—that same figure kicked the community in the … you know what. Donald Trump signed on to what appears to be a classic memecoin scam, taking 80 percent of the tokens in a new currency called TRUMP coins, for no investment. The 20 percent put up for sale drove the valuation of that tranche to over $14 billion—boosting Trump’s stake to about $50 billion, up from zero—by simply exploiting his popularity (and possibly the chance to win his favor by buying his otherwise useless coins). For good measure, the first lady released her own currency, and the value of the circulating MELANIA coins quickly shot up to $1 billion. Trustworthy investment vehicles do not behave like that, nor do functional currencies. At the moment when the industry is hoping to attain a new level of respectability, the new president is taking advantage of the very flaws in crypto that (understandably) keep the field from prime time.\nIt will now be up to the crypto-friendly Trump administration to come up with regulations that encourage innovation while protecting consumers. If the regulators are really friendly, they will lean towards rigor, not laissez-faire. If their rules permit schemes like TRUMP coins to legally exist, the exercise will be a failure, and mainstream acceptance will have to wait.\nSubmit your questions in the comments below, or send an email to mail@wired.com.

(The first USDS director, Mikey Dickerson, jokingly posted on LinkedIn, “I’d like to congratulate Elon Musk on being promoted to my old job.”) But reportedly <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/21/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/21/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge/\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/21/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Musk pushed for this</a> structure as a way to embed DOGE in the White House. I hear that inside the Executive Office Building, there are numerous pink Post-it notes claiming space even beyond USDS’s turf, including one such note on the former chief information officers’ enviable office. So maybe this could be a launch pad for a more sweeping effort that will eliminate whole agencies and change policies. (I was unable to get a White House representative to answer questions, which isn’t surprising considering that there are dozens of other orders that equally beg for explanation.)</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">One thing <em>is</em> clear—this ends United States Digital Service as it previously existed, and marks a new, and maybe perilous era for the USDS, which I have been enthusiastically covering since its inception. The 11-year-old agency sprang out of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp/\">high-tech rescue squad</a> salvaging the mess that was Healthcare.gov, the hellish failure of a website that almost tanked the Affordable Care Act. That intrepid team of volunteers set the template for the agency: a small group of coders and designers who used internet-style techniques (cloud not mainframe; <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://techfarhub.usds.gov/resources/learning-center/waterfall-vs-agile/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://techfarhub.usds.gov/resources/learning-center/waterfall-vs-agile/\" href=\"https://techfarhub.usds.gov/resources/learning-center/waterfall-vs-agile/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the nimble “agile” programming style</a> instead of the outdated “waterfall” technique) to make government tech as nifty as the apps people use on their phones. Its soldiers, often leaving lucrative Silicon Valley jobs, were lured by the prospect of public service. They worked out of the agency’s funky brownstone headquarters on Jackson Place, just north of the White House. The USDS typically took on projects that were mired in centi-million contracts and never completed—delivering superior results within weeks. It would <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/07/inside-the-obama-tech-surge-as-it-hacks-the-pentagon-and-va/\">embed its employees in agencies</a> that requested help, being careful to work collaboratively with the lifers in the IT departments. A typical project involved making DOD military medical records interoperable with the different systems used by the VA. The USDS became a darling of the Obama administration, a symbol of its affiliation with cool nerddom.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">During the first Trump administration, deft maneuvering kept the USDS afloat—it was the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/01/the-final-days-of-obamas-tech-surge/\">rare Obama initiative</a> that survived. Its second-in-command, Haley Van Dyck, cleverly got buy-in from Trump’s in-house fixer, Jared Kushner. When I went to meet Kushner for an off-the-record talk early in 2017, I ran into Van Dyck in the West Wing; she gave me a conspiratorial nod that things were looking up, at least for the moment. Nonetheless, the four Trump years became a balancing act in sharing the agency’s achievements while somehow staying under the radar. “At Disney amusement parks, they paint things that they want to be invisible with this certain color of green so that people don't notice it in passing,” one USDSer told me. “We specialized in painting ourselves that color of green.” When Covid hit, that became a feat in itself, as USDS worked closely with White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx on gathering statistics—some of which the administration wasn’t eager to publicize.</p><p class=\"paywall\">By the end of Trump’s term, the green paint was wearing thin. A source tells me that at one point a Trump political appointee noticed—not happily—that USDS was recruiting at tech conferences for lesbians and minorities, and asked why. The answer was that it was an effective way to find great product managers and designers. The appointee accepted that but asked if, instead of putting “Lesbians Who Tech” on the reimbursement line, could they just say LWT?</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nAs avian influenza rages through birds and dairy cattle across the United States, Georgia has become the latest state to detect the virus in a commercial poultry flock, and on Friday, it halted all poultry sales to mitigate further spread of the disease. Nationally, egg prices are soaring—if you can find them at all in your local grocery store.\nThe ongoing outbreak in animals has also led to at least 67 human cases of bird flu, with all but one causing mild illness. Earlier this month, a person in Louisiana died after being hospitalized with severe bird flu in December. It’s the country’s first recorded death attributed to H5N1.\nThe US has previously licensed three H5N1 vaccines for humans, but they’re not available commercially. The government has purchased millions of doses for the national stockpile in case they’re needed. But even as the outbreak spread, federal health officials under President Joe Biden were hesitant to deploy them. Experts say the decision comes down to risk, and currently, the risk of H5N1 remains low. Rolling out a vaccine to farm workers and others at higher risk of infection would be a more targeted tactic, but even that measure may be premature. Now, with a changeover in federal health leadership imminent as President Donald Trump begins his second term, the decision rests with the new administration.\n“At the moment, from the point of view of severity and ease of transmission, it does not seem like an imperative to get a vaccine out to protect humans,” says William Schaffner, a physician and professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.\nSo far, no person-to-person spread of H5N1 has been identified, but health officials are monitoring the virus for any genetic changes that would make transmission among people more likely. Most bird flu infections are related to animal exposures. Of the 67 known human cases in the US, 40 have been linked to sick dairy cattle and 23 are associated with poultry farms and culling operations. In the other four cases, the exact source isn’t known.\nIn the US, human cases have been mild, with many of them causing only conjunctivitis. In some cases, people have had mild respiratory symptoms. Aside from the Louisiana patient, all the individuals who tested positive for H5N1 recovered quickly and never needed to be hospitalized. Historically though, H5N1 has been fatal in around 50 percent of cases. Since 2003, a total of 954 cases of human H5N1 have been reported to the World Health Organization, and about half of them died. Egypt, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and China have reported the highest number of human bird flu deaths.\nThose numbers come with a few caveats. For one, many of those deaths occurred in places where people live very close to the sick poultry. “In those circumstances, the thinking is that they likely got a very large dose of the virus,” Schaffner says.\nPlus, the case fatality rate—the proportion of infected people who die from the disease—only takes into consideration known cases, and some cases of H5N1 are no doubt going undetected in part because bird flu symptoms are similar to other respiratory viruses. In the US, language barriers among farm workers, lack of testing, and a reluctance among workers to report that they’re sick are also factors. “We probably miss more cases than we detect, and we’re much more likely to detect a case that’s severe,” says Shira Doron, chief infection control officer for Tufts Medicine in Boston and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center.\nDoron says vaccination is not the only way to protect agricultural workers and other individuals who might come in contact with infected animals. She says providing personal protective equipment to farms, instructing workers on how to use that PPE properly, and educating the public about not going near sick or dying birds should be the main focus right now. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, manages a national stockpile that has face shields, gloves, respirators, and goggles available to farms that need them. The agency is also making the antiviral drug Tamiflu available to jurisdictions without their own stockpiles to treat symptomatic people with a confirmed or suspected exposure.\nAfter government measures during the Covid pandemic sparked anger and confusion, rolling out a vaccine for H5N1 too soon could do more harm than good. “There are some serious downsides to deploying a vaccine, especially when the risk doesn’t justify it,” Doron says. For instance, if a vaccine would cause side effects in some people who get it, that could erode public trust in the vaccine.\nThat happened in 1976, when President Gerald Ford ordered mass vaccination against swine flu to head off a pandemic. More than 40 million Americans received the vaccine in record time, but the shot caused a slightly increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare form of paralysis that is usually reversible but occasionally fatal. It was a major blow to trust in public health.\nSchaffner says if H5N1 mutates into a form that causes more severe disease or is spread easily from human to human, that should clearly trigger the use of a vaccine.\nBut Elizabeth Strater, national vice president of United Farm Workers, says person-to-person spread may not be obvious. “We understand that federal experts don’t recommend a vaccine program unless there is proof of person-to-person transmission. That said, there are so many cases in farm workers going unreported it may be difficult to determine exactly when that happens. Since farm workers can’t afford to isolate at home when they are infected, they are continuing to work while sick,” she says.\nWhile three H5N1 vaccines are already in the national stockpile, they were approved in 2007, 2013, and 2020, and were formulated to earlier strains of the virus. Two of those three vaccines have shown that they can generate neutralizing antibodies against the current version of the virus in lab studies. In the event that vaccines are needed, manufacturers are also working on shots that match the current strains circulating in birds and dairy cattle. Last week, HHS under President Joe Biden awarded Moderna $590 million to help fast-track the development of an mRNA vaccine, the same technology used in some of the Covid vaccines.\nWhether to use these vaccines will be left up to the Trump administration, and if confirmed, that decision would fall to Trump’s pick for HHS secretary, Robert F. Kennedy. A known vaccine skeptic, Kennedy questioned the need for a human bird flu vaccine on X last July.\nA vaccine for animals may be more politically palatable for the new Trump administration. Bird flu can kill poultry in just a few days, and once it is detected on a farm, entire flocks have to be culled. The Department of Agriculture has a national H5N1 vaccine stockpile for use in commercial poultry and said recently that it will add additional vaccines to it that have been updated for the current strain. US poultry producers have long resisted vaccination over fears that vaccinating birds could trigger bans on exported poultry, spark food safety concerns among consumers, and make it harder to detect bird flu outbreaks, since vaccination may not fully prevent infection.\nResearchers are also working on H5N1 vaccines for cattle. So far, at least seven candidate vaccines have been approved for field safety trials, according to a USDA announcement. Vaccinating cattle may be more feasible than immunizing poultry, as they live longer than commercial poultry, and dairy herds typically number in the hundreds while commercial flocks can have tens to hundreds of thousands of birds. Vaccinating dairy cattle could prevent some human cases of H5N1 but not all of them, since the virus is so widespread in birds and poultry.\n“If we can control, or at least contain, the virus in these reservoir species, then you can prevent the spillover to another species,” says Mahesh Kumar, senior vice president of Zoetis, an animal health company that is developing an H5N1 vaccine for cattle. He thinks the dairy industry will be more open to the idea of vaccination than poultry producers have been. “Dairy cattle are much more expensive,” he says. “There’s a huge impact, economically, for the dairy industry.”\nCorrection: 1/22/2024, 3:48 pm EST: This story has been corrected to properly identify Mahesh Kumar.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nApple's MagSafe technology is my favorite smartphone innovation of the past five years—it has changed how I use my phone. The Qi2 wireless charging standard introduced in 2023 was supposed to bring the same magnetic charging marvels to Android smartphones, as well as enable wider compatibility of accessories between iPhone and Android—which would have been most welcome. Sadly, after two years, there's only a single Qi2 Android phone out right now.\nYou'd think Samsung, in its never-ending quest to outshine Apple, would finally debut Qi2 on its new Galaxy S25 series—announced earlier today—but unfortunately that's not the case. The Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra support the Qi wireless charging standard, however, Samsung says they are “Qi2 Ready.” This is a workaround that brings full Qi2 functionality to these phones via magnetic cases. It's a bit complicated, so let me break it down.\nThe Promise of Qi2\nWe have a Qi2 explainer here, but to boil it down, it's the next stage of wireless charging, and it takes inspiration from Apple's MagSafe charging system. (Apple helped develop the Qi2 standard, and every iPhone since the iPhone 12 is now officially a Qi2 device, excluding the iPhone SE.) A ring of magnets inside a Qi2 phone can magnetically connect with a Qi2 wireless charger, allowing for precise energy transfer that makes wireless charging faster and more efficient.\nMy wife still complains when her Qi phone doesn't charge overnight because she didn't align it juuuust right on the charger. Well, that is not a problem with Qi2, because magnets! Jesse Pinkman said it best.\nThat isn't the only reason I like having magnets in my phone—the MagSafe system has opened up a world of magnetic accessories you can attach to the back of the device. At CES 2025, a part of my content workflow involves using a MagSafe camera cage for my iPhone, which I can magnetically pop on the mount without fussing with a clamp.\nWith every electric scooter and ebike I test, I pop my phone onto Peak Design's magnetic bike mount—an elegant solution far nicer than pulling silicone bands over my phone to keep it secure on the handlebars.\nI also very much enjoy placing my iPhone on my MagSafe car dock. Clamps are annoying, OK? If they weren't, why would accessory maker iOttie sell a car mount that automatically opens the clamps so you don't have to fuss with them? Clamps suck!\nThis is why I desperately want Qi2 to make its way into more Android phones, so I can natively use them with all these magnetic accessories—case or not.\nWhat’s “Qi2 Ready”?\nTwo years is apparently not enough lead time for Samsung to get its act together and add Qi2 to the Galaxy S25, but there's a stopgap measure. A bevy of “Qi2 Ready” cases will add complete Qi2 capabilities to the Galaxy S25. Samsung doesn't have to redesign the phone to add magnets, because the case is doing the hard work. (Qi2 Ready cases will be available from Samsung and third parties.)\nThese Qi2 Ready cases are certified and tested with Qi2 Ready phones so you can be sure that a Galaxy S25 with a Qi2 Ready case will work with a Qi2 charging accessory, whether that's a Qi2 power bank or a Qi2 wireless charger. (How many times can I write Qi2 in a sentence?) Paul Golden, director of marketing at the Wireless Power Consortium, the organization that manages the charging standard, tells me this system enables the same Qi2 charging speed and same energy efficiency. “It's a faster way, an easier way, for a company to offer a Qi2 experience without having to make that big change.”\nThis is important because, while we MagSafe lovers have made do with MagSafe Android phone cases these past few years, there's always been a caveat that these cases may not work with all MagSafe products. With Qi2 Ready cases, you can rest easy knowing they'll work with Qi2 chargers.\nIt's worth noting that OnePlus' latest flagship phone, the OnePlus 13, is not a Qi2 Ready phone, however, OnePlus sells a magnetic case to enable Qi2-like charging. This is the old approach of adding magnetic charging to phones with basic Qi support, and it will not turn your phone into a Qi2 device. While it may feel similar, you may not enjoy faster charging speeds, it will not be as energy efficient, and it's not guaranteed to work with all Qi2 accessories. Golden says Qi2 Ready phones have “special features built into them” to enable proper Qi2 functionality when paired with a Qi2 Ready case.\nAlas, as soon as you take these Qi2 Ready cases off the phone, the magnetic functionality disappears. This may not be a problem for most people. It's hard to find recent statistics, but a 2023 YouGov survey found that roughly 68 percent of Americans use a phone case, and a 2017 study put that number at 79 percent. But it does stink for those of us who don't like using a case. Pour one out for the case-less fiends.\nI can recall dozens of times when I've had to take my iPhone case off to attach a wireless microphone to the USB-C port or to fit the phone on a gimbal. Removing the case didn't change anything because iPhones have magnets built in, but this is something that will impact Qi2 Ready phones, and it's a frustrating limitation.\nI think Qi2 Ready phones are an acceptable in-between measure. Considering it's cheaper than embedding magnets into a phone, I hope it means more budget and midrange smartphones can enjoy Qi2 capabilities.\nStill, I worry that this will make things confusing for the average person. New phones will support Qi but not Qi2, but they'll have Qi2 Ready cases to enable Qi2—my brain hurt just writing that. If they just had native Qi2 support, magnetic charging would work all the time with any Qi2 accessory. Easy peasy.\nThe good news is that Samsung and Google have committed to releasing official Qi2 Android phones in 2025, so it is on the way, though it does feel bizarre that Samsung may not end up debuting it on its flagship smartphone series.\nI'll make do with a magnetic case (again), but for the love of God, can someone just give me my magnetic Android already?",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nSamsung's latest Android smartphones may give you déjà vu. The company showed off the new Galaxy S25 series at its Galaxy Unpacked event today in San Jose, California. Samsung has once again loaded its flagship phones with artificial intelligence capabilities, and while many of those features are tricks we've seen before—even almost a decade ago—they have now been infused with large language models that make them more effective.\nNo, really. One of the Galaxy S25 Ultra's stylus features is being rebranded from “Smart Select” to “AI Select,” and a Samsung executive joked, “Smart Select really wasn't that smart,” highlighting the efficacy of the new multimodal LLMs powering the feature (and the lengths these companies go to make every little feature sound “smart”).\nSamsung also teased another device at the end of its keynote, the Galaxy S25 Edge. It seems to be an ultra-thin version of the Galaxy S25, but outside of a brief image, the company did not share any other details. A Samsung representative says there's nothing else to share at the moment. The S25 Edge would be a direct competitor to the rumored iPhone 17 Air arriving later this year, reigniting the battle for the thinnest phone around.\nCurrently, the Galaxy S25 range is comprised of the Galaxy S25 ($800), Galaxy S25+ ($1,000), and Galaxy S25 Ultra ($1,300). The phones are available for preorder today and will officially go on sale February 7. Here's what's new, including a breakdown of the AI features that were given the spotlight.\nThe Hardware\nThe hardware is not much different from last year's Galaxy S24 series. I still find Samsung's design language rather anemic—these are rectangular slabs with very little flair. Even Apple is doing something different with all the new buttons available on the iPhone 16.\nThe phones go up in size, with the Galaxy S25 being the smallest and the Ultra being the largest. In an annual tradition, the bezels around the screens have been shaved down, and that's how Samsung says the Galaxy S25 Ultra achieved its slightly bigger 6.9-inch screen size despite having close to the same dimensions as its predecessor. The corners of all three phones are rounded now—the Ultra is no longer boxy—though Samsung flattened the edges for a nicer grip.\nSamsung employs Corning's new Gorilla Armor 2 glass on the S25 Ultra, which supposedly has 29 percent better resistance to fractures than the original Gorilla Armor on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Interestingly, Samsung says it saw a 60 percent drop in screen repairs from the S24 over the S23 series, which could mean the S25 is even more durable.\n|Galaxy S25\n|Galaxy S25+\n|Galaxy S25 Ultra\n|Display: 6.2 inches, 120-Hz LTPO, AMOLED\n|6.7 inches, 120-Hz LTPO, AMOLED\n|6.9 inches, 120-Hz LTPO, AMOLED\n|Build: Aluminum, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2\n|Aluminum, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2\n|Titanium, Corning Gorilla Armor 2 (front), Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (back)\n|Processor and RAM: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite and 12 GB of RAM\n|Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite and 12 GB of RAM\n|Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite and 12 GB of RAM\n|Storage: 128, 256, 512 GB\n|256 and 512 GB\n|256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB\n|Battery: 4,000 mAh\n|4,900 mAh\n|5,000 mAh\n|Cameras: 50-MP primary camera, 12-MP ultrawide, 10-MP 3X telephoto, 12-MP selfie\n|50-MP primary camera, 12-MP ultrawide, 10-MP 3X telephoto, 12-MP selfie\n|200-MP primary camera, 50-MP ultrawide, 50-MP 5X telephoto, 10-MP 3X telephoto, 12-MP selfie\n|Updates: 7 years of software updates\n|7 years of software updates\n|7 years of software updates\n|Extras: Non-magnetic Qi 2.1 wireless charging (Qi2 ready with case).

This will be the processor in all Samsung Galaxy S25 series phones globally, unlike prior years when Samsung opted for its own Exynos chips in some markets. Samsung claims this chip offers a 37 percent CPU upgrade, a 30 percent graphics boost, and a 40 percent improved neural processing unit when compared to the S24 series.\nSamsung and Qualcomm collaborated on optimizing the chip, and that close tie has enabled new features like ProScaler. On the S25 Ultra and S25+, this feature can upscale images on the screen to match the display resolution. Say you're browsing Instagram and someone uploaded a 1,080p image—it will be upscaled to QHD+.\nThe vapor chamber cooling system is larger on all three—a crucial component to keep the phones from getting too hot during intense gaming sessions—with the chamber in the S25 Ultra getting a 40 percent size bump. Samsung also says sitting on top of the chip is a new “tailored thermal interface material” that leaves zero gaps for air, pulling heat from the processor directly to the vapor chamber cooling system to increase performance and reduce stress on the battery.\nArguably the most disappointing part of the hardware story is the lack of support for Qi2 charging. This is the new version of the Qi wireless charging standard, which borrows a lot of features from Apple's MagSafe charging system. It embeds magnets into the phone, allowing users to magnetically attach the phone to a Qi2 charger for more efficient and faster wireless charging, plus the convenience of magnetic accessories to enhance the phone. I expected to see several Qi2 Android phones in 2024, but all we got was HMD's Skyline. Now, in a move that'll make things more confusing, the Galaxy S25 series is being classified as “Qi2 ready.”\nThis is a new classification for phones that won't have the built-in magnets but will feature official and third-party Qi2 cases with magnets inside, essentially bringing a similar if not the same magnetic experience as a proper Qi2 device. Android users who want MagSafe's utility have had to rely on these cases so far, so it's just a shame that Qi2 is still not natively part of these brand new phones.\nCamera specs are roughly the same as before, with the ultrawide being the exception on the Galaxy S25 Ultra—it now packs 50 megapixels instead of 12. Samsung says this in turn boosts the quality of macro photos. There are some more interesting changes to the image processing algorithm. Samsung's next-gen ProVisual Engine uses a “spatial-temporal filter” to distinguish between moving and stationary objects to ensure photo subjects don't blur when capturing a picture in low-light conditions. Double-analysis noise removal analyzes every pixel for noise, looks at eight pixels around it, and removes the noise to clean up the image.\nSamsung has routinely tried to match Apple with camera features, but it has typically skimped on all the “pro” video capabilities Apple offers, like ProRes or Log video recording. Well, now that's changing. The Galaxy S25 series supports “Galaxy Log” recording. This is a niche feature for a subset of creators, but it offers greater control over the colors and dynamic range of video clips. Videos are also now captured at 10-bit HDR.\nThere's not much else in the way of hardware innovation. You won't find any fancy silicon-carbon batteries that are available on phones like the OnePlus 13, nor charging speed improvements. In fact, something's missing this year on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen: Bluetooth. The stylus is still baked into the phone but it no longer features Bluetooth, eliminating some remote control features Samsung says barely anyone used.\nThe AI Party\nThe Galaxy S25 is a tale of two AIs: Gemini and Bixby. Yes, while Google's Gemini AI assistant sits at the forefront—it can finally be triggered through a long press of the power button—Samsung is bringing its original Bixby voice assistant out from the shadows.\nBixby has been enhanced with large language models but is still designed to handle phone functions, like changing device settings. Gemini is meant to be used for general web queries and more complex actions. You can even have two hot words, one for each assistant. I foresee all of this being confusing; in a quick demo, I asked Gemini to change the device font settings, and it said it couldn't do it. I asked Bixby, and it did the job. I have no idea why Gemini couldn't hand off this task to Bixby.\nThe highlight AI feature debuting on the Galaxy S25 series is “cross-app experiences.” These are tasks you can ask Gemini to perform, even if the task requires multiple apps. For example, you can ask for the schedule of this season's Arsenal matches and then add it to your calendar; Gemini will then search and add every Arsenal FC game in the season to your schedule. Or you can ask it to find pet-friendly vegan restaurants nearby and text the list to a friend. It even works with images too—snap a pic of your fridge and ask Gemini to find you a recipe based on the available ingredients. These cross-app experiences work with Google apps, Samsung's Galaxy apps, and select third-party apps, like WhatsApp and Spotify.\nIf these sound familiar, it's because phone makers have been promising variations of these commands for close to a decade. Now, they'll hopefully work better, especially since Gemini is adept at natural language and queries don't need to be so rigid. Speaking of, you can now search conversationally in Samsung's Gallery app to find old photos, much like what Google rolled out to Google Photos last year. Circle to Search can listen for audio sources to determine the name of a song—yet another long-available feature getting spruced up for the AI age.\nAll these AI features have culminated in a new app: Now Brief. Samsung calls this proactive assistance (remember Google's Now on Tap?) where a morning brief arrives with the weather, upcoming calendar events, stock details, news articles, and suggestions to trigger routines. There's also an evening brief with a summary of the day's events with photos. Since the feature can plug into email, it'll send reminders about expiring coupons and upcoming travel tickets. Samsung claims it can even suggest changing an 8:45 am alarm even earlier if it sees a 9 am meeting on the schedule.\nOn the lock screen, a “Now Bar” widget persists at the bottom, much like Apple's Live Activities. It'll offer quick access to the Now Brief app, but it will also show updates for favorite sports teams, along with glanceable directions from Google Maps.\nThe rest of the AI features are playing a bit of catch-up to Apple and Google's Pixel phones. There's Drawing Assist, a generative AI tool to craft new images in different art styles based on sketches or text prompts. AI Select works with the S Pen stylus on the S25 Ultra and understands what is selected—for example, if a video is selected, it will suggest turning it into a GIF. Audio Eraser is an editing tool to cut out background noise in videos post-capture, canceling out the sound of a crowd's chatter or an ambulance's siren. Finally, Samsung's Generative Edit feature, which lets you erase unwanted objects in images, now works locally on the device and is much more accurate and faster.\nSome good news on the sustainability front: Every Galaxy S25 device uses a minimum of 50 percent recycled cobalt in the battery, sourced from older Galaxy devices or discarded batteries during the manufacturing process. Samsung also says every external component of the S25+ and S25 uses at least one recycled material.\nLastly, there's one bit of news Samsung announced but won't be available at launch for these phones, and it pertains to Samsung Wallet. The company's tap-to-pay app will soon support a buy now, pay later system, allowing customers to create instant installment plans even when shopping offline. Also, it will support peer-to-peer payments regardless of digital wallet—meaning you might be able to send cash to a friend even if they're not on Samsung Wallet.\nI'll have a review of the phones soon to vet all the new features. Preorders are open now, and it officially hits stores on February 7. Samsung has a new Galaxy Club early upgrade program that's somewhat similar to Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program. After purchasing the phone, either via a trade-in or installment plan, you can pay $8.33 per month for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, for example, and upgrade to the next Galaxy device after 12 months. Samsung will pay the remaining installments or 50 percent of the retail price with a trade-in to the next upgrade.",

    "content_text": "The Mexican government has announced the Mexico Embraces You program, which includes economic and social services for Mexicans deported from the United States. This measure is in response to the strict immigration policy that President Donald Trump announced on January 20, and which has already begun to materialize with the closure of the CBP One app.\nCBP One was launched in 2020, allowing foreign vendors to schedule cargo inspections. In 2023 the Biden administration expanded its functions to include unauthorized migrants seeking asylum. This Monday, on Inauguration Day, an order from Donald Trump put an end to the program, and thousands of scheduled appointments were canceled.\nRosa Icela Rodríguez, head of the Ministry of the Interior (SEGOB), unveiled the project during the morning conference of Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum. Rodríguez explained that the strategy includes economic support of 2,000 pesos (about $100) for Mexican citizens who lack the resources to return to their communities of origin. This support will be delivered through the new Bienestar Paisano Card.\nFederal authorities add that the plan is designed to allow Mexican migrants to join existing social programs, which include pensions for senior citizens and people with disabilities, scholarships for elementary and high school students, and the initiatives Sembrando Vida, Mujeres con Bienestar, Jóvenes Construyendo el Futuro, and Salud Casa por Casa.\nRepatriated Mexicans will be affiliated with the Mexican Social Security Institute. The program will grant them access to insurance for sickness and maternity, work risks, disability and life, retirement, and for severance in advanced age and old age. They will also be able to enjoy all social benefits and childcare services provided by the Social Security Law.

About 63 percent of US teens and a third of US adults use TikTok, according to Pew Research Center.\nAmong the places some of them took refuge was Likee, a TikTok clone launched by the profitable Singaporean tech company Joyy in 2017. Likee had about 33.9 million monthly users as of November, most of whom were outside the US. But on Saturday, Likee drew 143 percent more downloads and 37 percent more usage in the US than the previous day, according to Sensor Tower, which estimates figures by gathering data from a sample of devices. The trend continued into Sunday, when Likee usage ticked up 11 percent from a day earlier.\nEstimates from Apptopia, another company that studies the app industry, show that for months, Likee recorded less than 10,000 downloads per day in the US before jumping to nearly 167,000 on Sunday and about 286,000 on Monday. Apptopia also estimated similar bumps for TikTok competitors Clapper and Flip.\nOn Tuesday, shares of Likee’s parent company, Joyy, closed up about 3 percent, outpacing the average gain among its Nasdaq peers. Joyy does not break out Likee’s financials, but it and some of its other sibling apps collectively generated about $73 million in sales during last year’s third quarter from advertising and user purchases. Likee did not respond to a request for comment.\nOther less-frequented apps, including Clapper and Snap’s Snapchat, drew increased interest over the weekend to the tune of double-digit gains in user activity. TikTok’s biggest rivals, Meta's Instagram and Facebook, saw more modest single-digit boosts. YouTube and X, meanwhile, experienced little change in usage.\nRedNote, another Chinese app that Americans had flocked to in protest during the days before the ban, added 80 percent more users Sunday than the day before, according to Sensor Tower. In the first two days of the rush earlier in the week, over 700,000 new users joined RedNote, Reuters reported. Known as Xiaohongshu in Chinese, it ranked in recent days as the most-downloaded free app on the Google and Apple app stores in the US.\nTikTok came back online in the US on Sunday after president-elect Donald Trump promised to provide a temporary reprieve of the new law when he took power the following day. The statute, signed by former President Biden last year, effectively bans TikTok by threatening to fine web hosting providers and app stores that work with its parent company, Chinese tech giant ByteDance, unless it divests its ownership in TikTok. Users came back to TikTok in droves on Sunday, with daily active users up 17 percent over Saturday, the Sensor Tower data show.\nOn Monday, Trump issued an executive order providing for 75 additional days to sort out the dilemma over TikTok. But the legality of his decree remains in question, and TikTok is still unavailable in US app stores.

    "content_text": "When online search engines first appeared, they seemed miraculous. Now, though? It is a truth near-universally acknowledged that search is in the dumps, corroded by spam and ads.\nBig players like Google are insistent that AI is the savior of search, despite many early attempts to integrate AI ending in disaster. There’s a wave of services offering AI-powered answers, including Perplexity and OpenAI’s SearchGPT. Recently, I got an email promoting another new AI search engine—but this one has a notably quirky approach to answering questions. Called Pearl, it’s coming out of beta this week. Like other AI-powered search engines, Pearl initially answers questions by using large language models to provide answers. Then it does something unusual: It offers a human fact-check and the option to connect with experts and chat online or on the phone about the answer.\nReading about its gimmick, I didn’t really understand why it bothered with the AI answers at all. Why not just go straight to the human? I called its CEO, Andy Kurtzig, to find out.\nKurtzig stressed that Pearl is an extension of another search project he’s been working on for decades: a more traditional offering called JustAnswer, which charges a subscription and connects people to subject-matter experts based on their questions. “We started playing with the concept of AI combined with professional services about 11 years ago,” he says. When the generative AI boom took off, he decided to make Pearl a stand-alone product. (The company has had an older chatbot product named Pearl for many years and at one point rebranded JustAnswer as Pearl and then changed it back.)\nPearl’s LLM is built on top of a number of popular foundational models, including ChatGPT, and is customized to include JustAnswer’s trove of data, which includes an extensive history of questions posed and answered since it launched in 2003.\nIn Kurtzig’s view, Pearl lowers the barrier to entry for answers from experts. While JustAnswer costs money, Pearl has a freemium model. Its AI answers are free, as is its first layer of human fact-check, the TrustScore™, a ranking on a scale from 1 to 5 about the quality of an AI answer. When Pearl users want to go a step further and have an expert expand upon an AI answer, they are prompted to sign up for its $28-a-month service fee.\nOne line in particular had jumped out at me in the initial email I received about Pearl. It had claimed that Pearl would “solve many of the mounting legal challenges AI search engines face.” But … how? Kurtzig noted that most AI search engines could be legally liable under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act for the answers they give, since they are acting more as a publisher than a platform. As Pearl incorporates human experts into its answer process, Kurtzig believes that Pearl will have the Section 230 protections that shield traditional search engines.\nOn top of that, he claims that Pearl is significantly less likely to provide misinformation than many other AI search engines—which he believes are likely to deal with “a tidal wave” of lawsuits based on bad answers they give. “Those other players are building amazing technologies. I call them Ferraris or Lamborghinis,” Kurtzig says. “We’re building a Volvo—safety first.”\nThis pitch about Pearl’s superiority, of course, made me even more keen to try it. Kurtzig seemed so certain that Pearl would still enjoy Section 230 protections. I asked the AI if it agreed.\nPearl said it likely qualifies as an “interactive computer service” under Section 230, which would mean that it’d be shielded from being treated as a publisher, just as Kurtzig suspected. But, the AI went on, “Pearl’s situation is unique because it generates content using AI.” It didn’t have a definitive answer for me after all.\nWhen I asked to speak to a lawyer directly, it rerouted me to JustAnswer, where it asked me to provide the answer I wanted verified. I said I needed to go back and copy the answer, as it was several paragraphs long, but when I navigated back to the Pearl website, the conversation was gone and it had reset to a fresh chat.\nWhen I tried again, this time opening the Pearl browser on desktop, I received a similarly uncertain answer. I decided to trigger a human-fact check; after several minutes, I received the TrustScore™—a measly 3!\nPearl recommended that I seek out an actual expert opinion, porting me to its subscription page. I’d been given a log-in so I didn’t have to pay while I tested the tool. It then connected me with one of its “legal eagle” experts.\nUnfortunately, the lawyer’s answers were not clearer than the AI. He noted that there was ongoing legal debate about how Section 230 will apply to AI search engines and other AI tools, but when I asked him to provide specific arguments, he gave a strange answer noting that “most use shell companies or associations to file.”\nWhen I asked for an example of one such shell company—quite confused about what that has to do with a public debate about Section 230—the “legal eagle” asked if I wanted him to put together a package. Even more confused, I said yes. I got a pop-up window indicating that my expert wanted to charge me an additional $165 to dig up the information.\nI declined, frustrated.\nI then asked Pearl about the history of WIRED. The AI response was serviceable, although basically the same stuff you’ll find on Wikipedia. When I asked for its TrustScore™ I was once again confronted with a 3, suggesting it was not a very good answer. I selected the option to connect with another human expert. This time around, possibly because it was a question about the media and not a straightforward legal or medical topic, it took a while for the expert to appear—well over 20 minutes. When he did, the expert (it was never established what gave him his media bona fides, although his profile indicated he’d been working with JustAnswer since 2010) gave me a remarkably similar answer to the AI. Since I was doing a free test, it didn’t matter, but I would’ve been annoyed if I had actually paid the subscription fee just to get the same mediocre answer from both a human and an AI.\nFor my last stab at using the service, I went for a straightforward question: how to refinish kitchen floors. This time, things went much more smoothly. The AI returned an adequate answer, akin to a transcript of a very basic YouTube tutorial. When I asked the human expert to assign a TrustScore™, they gave it a 5. It seemed accurate enough, for sure. But—as someone who really does want to DIY refinish my kitchen’s old pine planks—I think when I actually go looking for guidance, I’ll rely on other online communities of human voices, ones that don’t charge $28 a month: YouTube and Reddit.\nIf you end up testing Pearl, or any other newfangled AI search products, and you have a memorable experience, please do let me know how it went in the comments below the article. You can also reach me by email at kate_knibbs@wired.com. Thanks for reading, and stay warm!",

    "content_text": "California-based Vast Space has big ambitions. The company is aiming to launch a commercial space station, the Haven-2, into low Earth orbit by 2028, which would allow astronauts to stay in space after the decommissioning of the International Space Station (ISS) in 2030. In doing so, it is attempting to muscle in on NASA’s plans to develop commercial low-orbit space stations with partner organizations—but most ambitious of all are Vast Space’s goals for what it will eventually put into space: a station that has its own artificial gravity.\n“We know that in weightlessness we can live a year or so, and in conditions that are not easy. Perhaps, however, lunar or Martian gravity is enough to live comfortably for a lifetime. The only way to find out is to build stations with artificial gravity, which is our long-term goal,” says Max Haot, Vast’s CEO.\nVast Space was founded in 2021 by 49-year-old programmer and businessman Jed McCaleb, the creator of the peer-to-peer networks eDonkey and Overnet, as well as the early and now defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox. Vast Space announced in mid-December a partnership with SpaceX to launch two missions to the ISS, which will be milestones in the company’s plan to launch its first space station, Haven-1, later in 2025. The missions, still without official launch dates, will fall within NASA’s private astronaut missions program, through which the space agency wants to promote the development of a space economy in low Earth orbit.\nFor Vast, this is part of a long-term business strategy. “Building an outpost that artificially mimics gravity will take 10 to 20 years, as well as an amount of money that we don’t have now,” Haot admits. “However, to win the most important contract in the space station market, which is the replacement of ISS, with our founder’s resources, we will launch four people on a [SpaceX] Dragon in 2025. They will stay aboard Haven-1 for two weeks, then return safely, demonstrating to NASA our capability before any competitor.”\nSpace for One More?\nWhat Vast Space is trying to do, by showing its capabilities, is get involved in NASA’s Commercial Destinations in Low Earth Orbit (CLD) program, a project the space agency inaugurated in 2021 with a $415 million grant to support the development of private low-Earth orbit stations.\nThe money was initially allocated to three different projects: one from aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman, which has since exited the progam; a joint venture called Starlab; and Orbital Reef, from Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. Vast has no contract with the US space agency, but it aims to outstrip its competitors by showing NASA that it can put a space station into space ahead of these others. The agency will choose which project’s station to back in the second half of 2026.\nBy doing this, Vast is borrowing from SpaceX’s playbook. Not only has Vast Space drawn some of its employees and the design of equipment and vehicles from Elon Musk’s company, it’s also trying to replicate its approach to market: to be ready before anyone else, by having technologies and processes already qualified and validated in orbit. “We are lagging behind,” Haot says. “What can we do to win? Our answer, in the second half of 2025, will be the launch of Haven-1.”\nHaven-1 will have a habitable volume of 45 cubic meters, a docking port, a corridor with consumable resources for the crew’s personal living quarters, a laboratory, and a deployable communal table set up next to a domed window about a meter high. On board, roughly 425 kilometers above Earth’s surface, the station will use Starlink laser links to communicate with satellites in low Earth orbit, tech that was first tested during the Polaris Dawn mission in the autumn of 2024.\n“Although not intended for tourists or designed as a hotel, Haven-1 will boast a comfortable and unique design compared to its predecessor stations,” Haot says. “It will house professional astronauts or self-funded individuals who will perform important tasks, as the lab will be a demonstrator for Haven-2, with which we aim to replace ISS.”\nVast’s strategy also somewhat evokes that of the other ongoing commercial station project: that of Texas-based Axiom Space, which predates NASA’s CLD program. Axiom has a contract with NASA for producing modules for the ISS, and has plans to create its own commercial space station using these. The Axiom station should, in theory, be at an advanced stage, but in practice its assembly sequence was revised a few weeks ago, and the company is facing financial problems.\nA New Haven\nOnce the Haven-1 mission has launched, Haot is confident that Haven-2, the larger, modular second station, will soon follow. “The first module will be ready by 2028, so that NASA can have two years to test it while ISS is still operational. Three more identical modules will go into orbit between 2029 and 2030,” he says.\n“The first difference from Haven-1 will be certification from NASA, which will then become our main customer. Plus, Haven-2 will have two docking ports and be 5 meters longer, with twice the pressurized volume. This will allow us to have more life support resources and more space.”\nThe station’s core module, aboard a SpaceX Starship, will then be launched in 2030, with the already launched modules attaching to it. “It will have a 7-meter diameter, an airlock for extravehicular activities, a docking port, and a robotic arm. The original four modules will be reconfigured according to its characteristics, to add four more in 2031 and 2032.” In total, the station will then have a habitable volume of 550 cubic meters, capable of accommodating up to 12 people. (ISS has a habitable volume of 388 cubic meters.)\nBy then, tests to artificially reproduce gravity will have already begun, but not on Haven-2, which, having to serve as a laboratory, will have to meet weightlessness criteria imposed by NASA: “The tests will be carried out on Haven-1, which we plan to leave in orbit for three years, until 2028,” says Haot. “Before we run out of operations, we will rotate it to replicate lunar gravity on the payload portion, but without a crew. This will bring us closer to our corporate goal of continuing to promote artificial gravity.”\nImpossible not to notice, however, is how Vast Space’s ambitions are focused on a commercial market that is nonexistent to date. Even to this challenge, Haot has an answer: “So far, all space stations have been built by governments and at exorbitant prices: Our project will allow a cost reduction of about five times or maybe more. We are sure it is a profitable horizon, but we are not naive; certain conditions will need to be met.” Key, Haot says, will be securing NASA as an anchor customer, and building from there. “If we guarantee the interests of all the nations in the ISS program, but also attract countries hitherto excluded from the market—if in short we know how to create an efficient and low-cost company—our dreams will be within reach.”\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.",

    "content_text": "Almost four years to the day since his father was taken into custody for his part in the January 6 Capitol riot, Jackson Reffitt watched in complete shock as President Donald Trump signed an executive order that pardoned and commuted sentences for his father and some 1,500 other insurrectionists.\nReffitt has spent most of the last four years in hiding, constantly on the move every few months. He was the person who tipped off the FBI about his father’s involvement in the insurrection. Jackson’s father, Guy Reffitt, was a member of the Texas Three Percenter group when he stormed the Capitol wearing body armor and carrying a pistol and zip ties. He was caught on camera urging other rioters to storm the Capitol building and told members of his militia group that he intended to drag House Speaker Nancy Pelosi out of the building by her ankles, “with her head hitting every step on the way down.”\n“Trump himself has given him a presidential pardon to let him be free. That validation is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience that he's never going to get again,” Reffitt tells WIRED. “I can't imagine what he's going to be willing to do now. It could get a whole hell of a lot worse.”\nReffitt is “terrified” about what is going to happen next and has armed himself with a handgun and a rifle to protect himself and his boyfriend. Over the past few years, he has been targeted, harassed, and threatened online.\nSince Trump pardoned everyone, the threats are becoming even more intense.\nIn the last 24 hours “it's gotten worse than ever,” Reffitt tells WIRED. “I think just because, yet again, the validation that Trump is bringing is just making people a whole lot more emboldened to just say some vile, disgusting shit.”\nReffitt is not the only family member of a released January 6 prisoner who is concerned about the fallout from Trump’s blanket pardons. Tasha Adams, the ex-wife of Oath Keeper leader Stewart Rhodes, who had his 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy commuted by Trump, is also worried about what might happen. “Stewart is out of prison now and, frankly, I could really use a bit of a run fund, in case it comes to that,” Adams wrote on her GoFundMe page on Tuesday, hours after her ex-husband was released from prison.\nThe investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol became the biggest in Justice Department history and left many far-right militia groups in the country in ruins. But with a single pen stroke on Monday night, Trump has reinvigorated the militia movement, freeing their most prominent figures, including Rhodes and Proud Boy leader Enrique Tarrio.\n“One of things I’m most concerned about is the risk of groups that were decimated after J6 coming back stronger, especially since many of them had their sentences commuted or were outright pardoned,” says Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. “I wouldn’t be shocked if the Oath Keepers began making more appearances, and seeing the Proud Boys accelerate their culture war tactics, especially against the LGBTQ community, like we’ve seen before. Their leaders are free, they have a lot to catch up on, and they are likely feeling vindicated.”\nAre you a family member of a January 6 prisoner who is being released? We’d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact David Gilbert at david.gilbert@wired.com or securely on Signal on DavidGilbert.01\nGuy Reffitt was the first rioter to go on trial for his actions on January 6 and initially received a sentence of seven years and three months, which was reduced by seven months in December after a Supreme Court ruling that led to the dismissal of an obstruction charge against him.\n“I’m a very strong Patriot, with fabulous support from Patriot Warriors, as we navigate troubled waters,” Reffitt wrote to one acquaintance from jail in a text message submitted by the prosecution at his December resentencing.\nIn October, he sent another text message to the same acquaintance, writing: “I do love the J6 family dynamics. We really are a ‘Yuge’ family now. We all have a common goal. Save America and the people.”\nJackson Reffitt believes that his father has become even more extreme in prison. “He's gotten worse throughout the years,” says Reffitt. “He's gotten more radicalized, and now he gets out, and now he can buy a gun, and now he can do whatever he wants. That is just so terrifying to me.”\nAfter Trump signed the executive order, Jackson Reffitt switched on his laptop and began watching the celebrations at Freedom Corner, a site next to the DC Jail where activists have gathered every night for more than 900 days to call for the release of January 6 prisoners.\nOn camera, one of the leaders of Freedom Corner was shouting out the names of people who were going to be released, including many prisoners who had been convicted of violently assaulting police officers. The crowd responded to each name with loud cheers.\nAs Reffitt watched in terror, he saw people in the crowd that he recognized: his mother Nicole Reffitt and sisters Peyton and Sarah.\nNicole Reffitt has become one of the most prominent organizers of the January 6 vigils at Freedom Corner in recent years, moving from their family home in Texas to Washington, DC, full time.\nWhen WIRED spoke to Reffitt in the days after Trump’s election victory in November, she sought to strike a conciliatory tone, claiming that she was not calling for the release of all prisoners. “I don’t believe a blanket pardon is appropriate. A blanket pardon would give everyone a pass. There should be accountability. If you broke the law you should be held accountable.”\nHer son doesn’t believe her. “She never cared; she was trying to pander to a more inclusive audience. She wanted them free,” says Jackson Reffit, adding that his relationship with his mother is irreparably broken. His boyfriend is transitioning, and Jackson has not forgotten the slurs his mother has used about the LGBTQ community in online streams and publications.\nNicole Reffitt did not respond to messages and calls from WIRED.\nJackson Reffitt says he is safe for now and that he will eventually speak to his father, but not for some time. “Once I feel situated, and once I figure out what's going on with him and everything, then I can work on [contacting him],” Reffitt said. “But right now I can’t. I'm just too paranoid.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nSo you need to send some money. Maybe you want to slip a couple of $20 bills in a birthday card. Maybe it’s a larger payment for some not-at-all-sketchy, off-the-books services rendered. Either way, it can be a pain to send paper money without having to worry that it might mysteriously slip out of your envelope into someone else’s pocket.\n“Sending cash physically via mail or something is probably one of the least efficient options for moving money around,” says Kevin L. Matthews, a financial adviser who has offered money advice for WIRED before. “It's not necessarily something that I would recommend.”\nThe problem, he says, is that if something goes wrong and the cash goes missing, there’s really nothing you can do about it. There are better ways to transfer finances, but if you absolutely have to get your coins from one piggy bank to another, here are the best ways to do so without getting ripped off.\nDon’t Get Scammed\nTo be clear up front, you should not just stick a wad of cash in the mail and hope for the best. There's too high of a chance it will get lost, stolen, or otherwise wind up in the hands of someone you don’t intend.\nAnd to that last point, if you are sending somebody any kind of payment, ask yourself these basic questions: Do you personally know the individual you’re sending money too? Have you vetted the agency purporting to get your dough to the right place? Is there any fine print? Does the method for sending money seem too good to be true? If any of those questions give you pause, it's probably a scam.\nScams are evolving quickly, Matthews says, and they are getting more difficult to detect all the time. “The number one rule is, don't ever send any money to anyone that you do not know. And don't be afraid to call and check. That's always an option. Be careful of the details, verify the information, and just make sure this makes sense. Because usually once that money walks out the door, it's absolutely not coming back.”\nThere are lots of ways to keep yourself and your loved ones from getting ripped off and protect yourself from AI scam calls. (Grandma, I promise you, Charter.bot texting to ask you to send it gift cards is not a legitimate way to pay your cable bill.)\nPaper Trail\nThere are ways to send cash safely. If you’re just sending a small amount, like slapping a fiver in a birthday card, using the regular mail system is probably fine. You run the risk of it getting lost, like with anything you mail. But if you care about the money getting where it needs to go, you should insure it or send a money order.\nIn the US, you’re allowed to ship cash up to $500 without having to register it with the US Postal Service. It’s not technically illegal to send more than that through the US Mail, but it’s also not a good idea. If you do need to send cash and don’t mind Uncle Sam knowing about it, you can insure your package for a value of up to $50,000. There are a couple caveats, though.\nFirst, there is an additional charge for protected postage, ranging from $10 to $42, depending on the declared value inside. (For cash, the declared value is however much money you’re sending.) And you’ll have to go into an actual post office to declare how much money you are sending, then fill out a form for Registered mail. After sending the envelope or package, you can use the USPS tracking service to see when your money is delivered. The process is a bit of a pain but certainly better than sending a box of cash that “mysteriously” disappears.\nCheck It Out\nChecks are the vinyl albums of payment methods—a seemingly outdated medium, inconvenient to get set up, but overall really worthwhile once you get into it.\n“If I had to do something like this and send money physically, I would go old-school,” Matthews says. “I would send a check.”\nChecks are a way to get money to someone quickly and efficiently through the mail while also having the built-in protection that only the person whose name you make the check out to should be able to cash it. If something goes wrong, you can call your bank and cancel the check. Plus, most banks now offer the ability to remote-deposit checks by taking pictures of them, so your recipient shouldn’t need to go into a bank if they want to deposit.\nMoney Order\nAlternatively, you can send a money order through the US Postal Service or a service like Western Union. In the UK, Royal Mail has a Special Delivery service for sending money. Fees vary widely, though the USPS is probably your best bet in the US if you can get to a post office (fees there range from $1 to $3). You can send up to US$1,000 anywhere in the US via the post office. On the other end, your recipient will get the money order in the mail, then cash the money order at their local post office. That means they will also need to go to the physical location.\nWalmart offers money order services as well, via a partnership with Western Union. The difference is that Walmart says it charges a maximum fee of $1 for its services. You’ll also have to go into a physical Walmart location and share the details of the sender (that’s you) and the recipient.\nMoney orders are safe and reliable if you get them through the right vendor. The only downside is that your recipient will have to go to the same establishment that you did to cash the check, like a post office or Walmart.\nDigital Dollars\nYou probably already know how to send money on your phone. Apps like Venmo and CashApp are ubiquitous, as they are fast and easy ways to request and transfer money between your accounts. (If you link a credit card, you may be charged a fee.) If you and your recipient both have Apple devices, you probably already have a person-to-person money-transfer option built into your phone. Apple Cash lets you send money directly to your contacts and even transfer it by tapping the devices together. (There used to be a similar way to do this natively on Android phones with the Google Pay app, but Google merged that into its Wallet app and ditched the peer-to-peer payment services.)\nIf you want to make it feel a little less transactional than the last time you paid your friend for chicken wings, you can make a payment app transaction a little snazzier with Gift card mode. Just make a payment in either Venmo or CashApp and there will be a small gift option in the window. Tap that, and you’ll be able to choose to send a digital gift card for a specific retailer, or just send cash. You can choose a fun little animation that your recipient will see, so it will alert them and not just appear like a routine transaction. See? Look how thoughtful you are!\nIf you don't need to worry about gifting, Zelle is a great option. If it's offered by the banks of both parties, then it's tied directly to your bank accounts. The money is transferred between accounts within minutes and ready to spend right away. There are a couple of limitations: Zelle only works between US banks, and there are daily limits for transfers that can be as low as $500.\nMatthews cautions that even though these methods seem like the most direct and straightforward, they have also been prone to attracting scammers who try to capitalize on the public social feeds that are displayed in services like Venmo.\nInternational Waters\nIf you’re looking to send money internationally, your safest bet is a wire transfer. There are also online services like Wise.com that calculate the exchange rate and send funds while charging roughly a 0.88 percent fee. (So if you send $1,000, Wise takes an $8.75 fee.)\nGift Cards\nIf all this feels too risky or not worth the bother, there are always that old holiday stalwart: gift cards.\nGift cards can feel like a slightly more personal touch than just tossing a wad of bills at your giftee. After all, you know this kid likes his PlayStation, so your Best Buy gift card means you’ve been paying at least a little attention, right?\nYou can also buy gift cards that aren’t tied to a specific retailer and can be spent freely anywhere that accepts regular debit card payments. Banks sell them as preloaded debit cards backed by the major credit card companies: American Express, MasterCard, and Visa. They charge a fee, usually between $3 and $8, depending on the total amount loaded onto the card. You or your recipient can also create an online login at the issuer’s website, which will let them keep track of the balance remaining on the card. There are sketchy gift card sellers out there, though, so you should do your best to make sure the card is legit and reputable by getting a referral from the issuer: Visa, MasterCard, and American Express all sell gift cards through third-party partners.\nBe Careful With Crypto\nCryptocurrency is all the rage, except for when it very much is not. If you’re using a stablecoin—a digital currency that is directly tied to the value of a fiat currency like the US dollar, you’re probably fine. But more volatile coins that fluctuate wildly may not be the best for making casual payments.\n“You are absolutely taking risk depending on what coin you use,” Matthews says. “You send something like Bitcoin or Doge or whatever else is out there, then the value of that may or may not be what you expect it to be between the time you send it and time the person gets it or the time you wake up the next morning. So it can absolutely be a risk. You could be giving somebody a fortune, or nothing at all.”",

Maybe you want to slip a couple of $20 bills in a birthday card. Maybe it’s a larger payment for some not-at-all-sketchy, off-the-books services rendered. Either way, it can be a pain to send paper money without having to worry that it might mysteriously slip out of your envelope into someone else’s pocket.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“Sending cash physically via mail or something is probably one of the least efficient options for moving money around,” says Kevin L. Matthews, a financial adviser who has offered money advice for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/video/watch/tech-support-financial-advisor-answers-money-questions-from-twitter\">WIRED before</a>. “It's not necessarily something that I would recommend.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">The problem, he says, is that if something goes wrong and the cash goes missing, there’s really nothing you can do about it. There are better ways to transfer finances, but if you absolutely have to get your coins from one piggy bank to another, here are the best ways to do so without getting ripped off.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Don’t Get Scammed</h2><p class=\"paywall\">To be clear up front, you should not just stick a wad of cash in the mail and hope for the best. There's too high of a chance it will get lost, stolen, or otherwise wind up in the hands of someone you don’t intend.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">And to that last point, if you are sending somebody any kind of payment, ask yourself these basic questions: Do you personally know the individual you’re sending money too? Have you vetted the agency purporting to get your dough to the right place? Is there any fine print? Does the method for sending money seem too good to be true? If any of those questions give you pause, it's probably a scam.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Scams are evolving quickly, Matthews says, and they are getting more difficult to detect all the time. “The number one rule is, don't ever send any money to anyone that you do not know. And don't be afraid to call and check. That's always an option. Be careful of the details, verify the information, and just make sure this makes sense. Because usually once that money walks out the door, it's absolutely not coming back.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">There are lots of ways to keep yourself and your loved ones from <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/older-relatives-getting-ripped-off/\">getting ripped off</a> and protect yourself <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protect-yourself-ai-scam-calls-detect/\">from AI scam calls</a>. (Grandma, I promise you, <em>Charter.bot</em> texting to ask you to send it gift cards is not a legitimate way to pay your cable bill.)</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Paper Trail</h2><p class=\"paywall\">There are ways to send cash safely. If you’re just sending a small amount, like slapping a fiver in a birthday card, using the regular mail system is probably fine. You run the risk of it getting lost, like with anything you mail. But if you care about the money getting where it needs to go, you should insure it or send a money order.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In the US, you’re allowed to ship cash up to $500 without having to register it with the US Postal Service. It’s not technically illegal to send more than that through the US Mail, but it’s also not a good idea. If you do need to send cash and don’t mind Uncle Sam knowing about it, you can <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-are-the-Limits-for-Insuring-Cash-and-Checks\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-are-the-Limits-for-Insuring-Cash-and-Checks\" href=\"https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-are-the-Limits-for-Insuring-Cash-and-Checks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">insure your package</a> for a value of up to $50,000.

    "content_text": "A little over 11 years and three months ago, Ross Ulbricht was arrested in the science fiction section of a public library in San Francisco, caught with his laptop still logged in to the Silk Road, the world’s first dark-web drug market that he created and ran under the pseudonym the Dread Pirate Roberts.\nNow, after being sentenced to life in prison and spending more than a decade behind bars, Ulbricht will walk free, thanks to Donald Trump—and to the president’s ever-closer ties to the American cryptocurrency world.\n“I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbright to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,” president Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday evening, misspelling Ulbricht's last name. “The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!”\nFor close to two and a half years after Ulbricht created the Silk Road in 2011, the dark-web site facilitated the sale of vast amounts of narcotics, as well as counterfeit documents, money laundering services and, at times, guns, for hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin payments. After the FBI located the Silk Road’s server in Iceland in 2013 and arrested then 29-year-old Ulbricht in San Francisco, he was convicted on seven charges relating to the distribution of narcotics, money laundering, and computer hacking, as well as a “continuing criminal enterprise” statute—sometimes known as the “kingpin statute”—usually reserved for mob bosses and cartel leaders. In 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison, a punishment beyond even the 20-plus years that prosecutors in the case requested.\nSince then, a Free Ross movement has steadily pressed for Ulbricht’s release, first in a failed appeal, then in petitions for clemency. Many of Ulbricht’s supporters have long argued that the Silk Road was a principled libertarian experiment in free trade, one in which Ulbricht allowed only “victimless crime”—despite prosecutors arguing during his trial that at least six people died of opioid overdoses from drugs linked to the Silk Road. They point out that Ulbricht never actually sold or possessed drugs himself, and rather ran a website that facilitated their sale. And they argue that by moving the sale of narcotics online, he reduced violence in the drug trade and committed no violence himself.\nThat argument has been complicated, however, by allegations that Ulbricht tried to have six people killed who presented a threat to him or the Silk Road. Ultimately all six alleged murders-for-hire were fake—one was staged by undercover DEA agents and five more were a scam. Ulbricht was charged with only one of those alleged paid killings in a separate prosecution in Maryland, which was then dropped after he received a life sentence in his New York trial. But evidence presented at Ulbricht’s trial showed him allegedly arranging those killings and even pinpointed transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain that showed a payment for them from Ulbricht’s laptop to the would-be killer.\nThose allegations of murders-for-hire, in fact, dissuaded the first Trump administration from granting clemency to Ulbricht. The White House in 2020 considered freeing Ulbricht but ultimately rejected the idea because of the alleged role of violence in the case, according to one former government official involved in the process who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity.\nSince then, however, the Trump administration has shifted its stance on Ulbricht’s case—in part, perhaps, due to its embrace of the libertarian cryptocurrency community, for whom Ulbricht has become a martyr and cause célèbre. At the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, DC, last May, then presidential candidate Trump promised to commute Ulbricht’s sentence “on day one” if reelected. (Ultimately, day one passed with no clemency for Ulbricht, even as Trump pardoned more than a thousand participants in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, though Trump ally Elon Musk promised in a post to X on Monday evening that “Ross will be freed too.”)\nJust what role Ulbricht will play in the free world is far from clear. Even in his statement to the judge at his sentencing hearing in 2015, Ulbricht never fully acknowledged the harm inflicted by the Silk Road’s drug sales. And according to Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a former Homeland Security Investigations agent who infiltrated the Silk Road during the investigation, Ulbricht still shows little remorse for his actions in his public posts to X.\n“The idea of him being released doesn’t bother me in the least,” says Der-Yeghiayan, who now works as the head of strategic intelligence at cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis. “I do get bothered if there’s now a perception that he did nothing wrong; that doesn’t acknowledge the facts of the case.”\nAmong some advocates of criminal justice reform, however, Ulbricht has become an exemplar of oversentencing, particularly given that he was technically charged with nonviolent crimes. “Ross has served more than enough time. He has been a model prisoner. He’s a first-time, nonviolent offender. He poses zero safety risk to the community,” Alice Johnson, CEO of the justice reform foundation Taking Action for Good, told WIRED in November. Johnson spent two decades in prison herself for attempted possession with intent to distribute before Trump commuted her life sentence in 2018 and pardoned her in 2020. “I believe that Ross’ case is going to pave the way for many others who have been unjustly given these draconian sentences to come home.”\nOn Tuesday night, Ulbricht's supporters celebrated his freedom and voiced their gratitude to Trump for his clemency. “Words cannot express how grateful we are,” reads a tweet from @Free_Ross, an X account devoted to the more than decade-long effort on Ulbricht's behalf. “President Trump is a man of his word and he just saved Ross's life. ROSS IS A FREE MAN!!!!!\"\nAdditional reporting by Joel Khalili",

    "content_text": "In the summer of 2020, 15 recognized leaders in US public health gathered to author an article in The Lancet—one of the world’s most eminent medical journals—decrying Donald Trump’s intention to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization, a decision that was later reversed by President Biden before it took effect.\nNearly five years later, one of the opening salvos of Trump’s second term has been to again initiate the process of withdrawing the US from the WHO. The move is already drawing both controversy and the threat of legal challenges.\nAccording to a 1948 joint resolution passed by both houses of Congress, any such withdrawal requires the US to provide the WHO with one year’s notice, but it appears that Trump’s intentions are to withdraw immediately and do so without seeking congressional approval.\n“The executive order announces the immediate withdrawal from WHO, and he’s not seeking congressional authorization, and he’s also not giving the required one year’s notice,” says Lawrence Gostin, a professor in public health law at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, DC, and one of the coauthors of the 2020 Lancet article. “In my view, this is reckless and it’s lawless, and it needs to be challenged in court.”\nTrump has a long history of criticizing the WHO, previously accusing the organization of being “corrupt,” ripping off America, and “severely mismanaging and covering up” the spread of Covid-19. The US has historically been one of the WHO’s largest funders, with some estimates suggesting that it provides a fifth of the organization’s entire budget. Between 2022 and 2023, the US provided the WHO with nearly $1.3 billion.\nHowever, Gostin and others are particularly concerned about the impacts of a US withdrawal on the country’s ability to manage the ongoing threat of infectious diseases. While the WHO has a far-reaching remit, ranging from advice on essential medicines to public policy recommendations on everything from tobacco and drug use to road safety, it is arguably most impactful when it comes to the surveillance of potentially problematic new diseases, such as bird flu, and coordinating an international response.\n“Withdrawing from WHO makes us more alone, more vulnerable, and more fragile in the world,” says Gostin. “You can’t shut down a border against a pathogen. We need WHO to be on the ground to put out fires before they get to the United States. And we also need WHO’s vast network to provide us with the information about mutations and viruses that we need to develop life-saving vaccines and medical treatments.”\nAccording to Sten Vermund, chief medical officer of the Global Virus Network and another coauthor of The Lancet article, what happens next depends on the reactions of other countries and nongovernment organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which all provide the WHO with significant funding. After Trump cut US contributions to the WHO to $680 million in 2020–21, Germany responded by quadrupling its contributions to more than $1 billion. The Danish government also agreed to double its contributions, placing a strong emphasis on improving sexual and reproductive health and tackling the rise of non-communicable diseases.\n“President Trump is trying to downsize the WHO, and the question is whether other high-income nations like those in Europe, Australia, Japan, and elsewhere, pick up some of the slack,” says Vermund. “Will the Gates Foundation, which has been a very generous donor, pick up some? It’s conceivable that others will tide things over until we have a new administration that might be more friendly to the WHO, but I’m dubious that they can pick up the entire chunk of the WHO budget which is paid for by the US.”\nAnd it isn’t just money that the US provides to the WHO, but staff and expertise too. “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has seconded a number of staff to the WHO, and I would predict that the Trump administration, with a new CDC director, will call those folks home,” says Vermund. “That would create quite a gap, because WHO funds do not pay for those individuals. So I think you’d have an almost immediate reduction of workforce and removal of critical professionals within the WHO organization.”\nAccording to Gostin, a lot of the money the US provides to the WHO is core mandatory funding, which all members are required to give, but some funds are particularly earmarked for causes in which the US has a vested interest, such as polio eradication, HIV/AIDS, and the process of identifying and controlling disease outbreaks before they spread and reach American shores. Without US funding, Gostin says that these programs wouldn’t completely disappear, but they would be significantly weakened.\n“Polio could come surging back,” says Gostin. “Remember we had polio in the wastewater in New York just a couple of years ago, and our kids are not being immunized. And we’ve had other real health scares in the United States, not just Covid-19, which killed more than a million people. We’ve had Zika, and the next health emergency might be just a mutation or two away. Maybe it’s already here in the form of avian influenza, and we’re going to need WHO to help us with that.”\nBoth Gostin and Vermund fear that withdrawing from the WHO will place the US at the back of the line when it comes to receiving critical information such as pathogen samples and genomic sequencing data, which pharmaceutical companies require to generate effective vaccines. Gostin cites how the US relies on WHO data every year to effectively update the seasonal influenza vaccine, while Vermund explains that financially speaking, it is far more efficient for the US to fund the WHO to help “snuff out” diseases at their source, rather than trying to tackle them when they arrive in the country.\n“We spent over $2 billion preparing for Ebola to hit US shores in 2014 and 2015, and since we only had five or six cases, that was very cost-ineffective,” says Vermund. “So that’s a typical example of how when the US goes it alone, it will be very inefficient compared with contributing to a multinational response to control a disease in the country of origin.”\nTrump’s decision does have one historical precedent, with Ronald Reagan’s administration being equally critical of the WHO throughout the 1980s. By the end of 1987, the WHO was facing the worst budget crisis in its history after the US delayed sending promised payments and recalled staff, despite the emergence of HIV/AIDS as a global killer. Public health experts at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health have since criticized this as contributing to the AIDS crisis.\nGostin believes that instead of paying less, the US should be putting pressure on other leading global powers such as China, Russia, Brazil, and India to pay more to the WHO to help support traditionally underfunded issues, such as the need to train more doctors and nurses in Africa, address the global rise of chronic diseases, and improve measures that can make us better prepared for the next pandemic.\nBecause of the potential impact of Trump’s decision, Gostin told WIRED that he is currently seeking cross-party political backing to potentially file a lawsuit to the Supreme Court, challenging Trump’s executive order. “Trump believes he can do it on his own,” he says. “But I think this is too consequential and momentous a decision for the president to make unilaterally on a whim, or as a grudge against WHO. It’s important enough that we need Congress to weigh in.”\nFor now, Vermund says that having made the WHO withdrawal a priority at the start of his presidency, it is highly likely that Trump will ultimately be able to get it over the line. While the US is supposed to fulfil its financial obligations to the agency for 2025, he also doubts that this will happen.\n“He’s initiating it very early in his presidency, on day one, and that gives him a lot of time to negotiate Congress and the courts if it should come to that,” says Vermund. “If he doesn’t pay his bills to an international agency, I’m not aware of any enforcement mechanism that is available. He may choose to ignore the agreements and go forward without formal legal authority.”",

    "content_text": "From the campaign trail, President Donald Trump was consistent: He would “end the electric vehicle mandate.” So it’s no surprise the phrase popped up in an executive order he signed on Monday, just hours after being sworn into office.\nHere’s the catch: The US has never had an EV mandate, or any sort of law or regulation requiring American buyers to go electric. Instead, the previous administration tried to create a series of carrots and sticks designed to make electric vehicles more appealing to both the manufacturers who make them and the people who buy them. An executive order issued yesterday attempts to undo all that.\nBut it’s complicated. Experts say the effects of the order aren’t clear and will likely take a while to iron out. The electric vehicle parts of the order seem more about messaging than immediate practical effects. “A lot of it is signaling the administration’s intent,” says Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and environment at the Duke Nicholas School of the Environment. “It’s unclear what the administration will be able to do immediately.”\nIn the meantime, automakers will continue to make and sell electric vehicles, and consumers will continue to be able to buy them. Some stricter emissions standards kick in in late 2026, and it usually takes manufacturers some five years to plan and build a car, which means autos following those forthcoming emissions regulations should be built and sold.\nUS and global automakers have already backed off some of their more ambitious EV-related promises, but electrics are still coming. The long-term future of the US auto industry is far from clear. Other governments are still pursuing EV-friendly policies, and critics warn they’ll look increasingly toward China’s auto industry to get them through the transition.\nOne thing that is clear for the future of EVs in the United States: There will be lawsuits.\nReports Incoming\nMonday’s executive order demands US agencies take a look at their rules related to EVs and determine whether they’re “unduly burdensome” and interfere with consumer choice. Those agencies are supposed to write up those findings into reports, which are due in 30 days.\nFrom there, the bureaucracy starts grinding, says Kathy Harris, who directs the clean vehicles program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If an agency wants to repeal a regulation, they need to go through the public process,” she says. That means publishing new proposed rules, taking public comments, going back and forth with the industry, and then publishing those comments. Lots of paperwork sits between the Trump administration and the final nixing of any EV-related programs.\nThe clearest way for the White House to loosen rules requiring automakers to make more EVs will be to target vehicle fuel efficiency and tailpipe standards. These require manufacturers to reach certain levels of gas efficiency across all the cars they make in the coming years and to cap the pollutants released. One of the easier ways automakers can hit those goals is to sell more electric vehicles, which don’t use gas or emit tailpipe pollutants at all. Last time Trump was in office, it took more than three years for his administration to replace Obama-era fuel efficiency standards. This time around, agencies might be more efficient and succeed in changing the rules more quickly, says Harris. Still, the process could take months and months.\nAnother area the Trump administration will likely target are subsidy programs, including the sort that give EV buyers federal tax credits that bring down the price of electrified cars by up to $7,500. The executive order does not explicitly mention this policy at all. This makes a sort of sense. The credits come from a law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and any changes to that law will need to make their way through Congress. The administration could try to stop handing out these credits through the Treasury Department, says Johnson, but that would likely trigger a lawsuit.\nThe order explicitly targets programs handing out funding for electric vehicle charging, more than $7 billion established by 2021’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and meant to ease the construction of new public chargers across the US. The order requires agencies to pause giving out those funds while they figure out whether they were appropriated with “consistency.” Much (but not all) of that funding has already been allocated to the states, many of which have signed contracts with infrastructure builders to get those chargers in the ground. It may be too late to put the brakes on all that charger money.\nJeff Davis, a budget and policy expert who is a senior fellow with the Eno Center for Transportation, says this section of the order is particularly “poorly drafted.” Its particular language means that it won’t prevent money from going out the door and projects getting built, but will make it hard for the states to get reimbursed after the work is done. This sort of thing “can be solved by suing the federal government and winning in court,” he says.\nAnother bit of wonkiness: The overly broad language of the order could mean that it not only puts a pause on climate-related programs but also all the projects funded by the infrastructure law. That includes billions in funding for highway construction projects, transit, airports, and even pipeline safety, Davis says.\nThe Golden State\nFor those interested in the future of EVs, attention now moves to California. Since the 1970s, the state has been allowed to create its own air regulations, including rules around vehicles. The executive order set out the Trump administration's intention to “terminate” the state’s abilities to control its own auto sales standards—exactly the power California is set to use to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars in the state by 2035.\nThe EPA will have to take the first step here to revoke that special privilege, granted to California through a “wavier.” That “inevitably be challenged in court,” says Julia Stein, the deputy director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA’s School of Law. The last Trump administration tried to nix California’s waiver; that didn’t work. Today, attempts will likely still “stand on shaky legal footing,” says Stein. “The upshot is that we’re in for another long waiver fight.”",

    "content_text": "It was an opportunity too good for Meta to ignore: On January 19, TikTok, one of its biggest social media rivals, was set to go dark across the United States when a new national security law went into effect. In the days and weeks before the ban, as millions of Americans were scrambling to find a suitable alternative to TikTok, Meta found ways to promote Instagram and Facebook as the answer. The tech giant made a flurry of design tweaks, rolled out new features, and ran advertisements that all positioned its platforms—and especially its video product, Reels—as direct competitors to TikTok.\nInstagram has scaled back its in-app shopping initiatives in recent years, but on Friday, Meta showed off a new feature that appears to be directly ripped from TikTok Shop, TikTok’s widely successful ecommerce platform. In a promotional video, two shopping creators working for Meta explained how influencers can now “more prominently display” products they are marketing in Reels. Instead of putting an Amazon or Walmart link in the comments, they can add a banner directing viewers to click on the item at the bottom of their videos—just like how it works on TikTok Shop.\nSome of Meta’s other efforts were just as pointed. Right before TikTok stopped working for roughly 14 hours on Saturday, some people reported that among the last things they saw on the platform were sponsored posts for Instagram. “Unsurprisingly, as TikTok goes down tonight, Meta is flooding my FYP with ads for Instagram,” one person said in a Bluesky post, referring to TikTok’s AI-powered For You Page feed. “In my last hour of TikTok I saw ads for instagram,” another person said on Threads.\nTikTok’s Ad Library, a transparency tool that allows anyone to search what paid campaigns are running on the platform, shows that Meta ran dozens of sponsored videos about Instagram and Reels in January that were collectively viewed by millions of users. But the tool includes data from only a select number of countries—mostly in Europe—and doesn’t cover what ads TikTok users may have seen in the United States. Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nOn Facebook, a number of people reported seeing a different promotion appear on their news feeds last week, encouraging them to link their TikTok accounts to their Facebook pages. “Build your social presence across apps by showing your TikTok profile link and follower count on your Facebook Page,” one version of the message read.\nGiven the timing, “this feels a bit passive aggressive,” one user wrote on X along with a screenshot of the banner. “Facebook is trolling users by suggesting we add our TikTok accounts to our Facebook pages,” joked another person.\nThe prompt appears to be connected to a feature Meta launched last month that allows users to display their YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram handles and follower counts on Facebook. However, the banner that people reported seeing in recent days mentioned only TikTok by name. The feature makes it easier for creators’ followers on other platforms to find and follow them on Facebook.\nTikTok announced it was coming back online in the US on January 19, after president-elect Donald Trump signaled he would sign an executive order following his inauguration the next day extending the deadline for the new law to take full effect. But Capcut, the beloved video-editing app run by TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, remained inaccessible for many people until Monday. Meta rushed to fill the gap, announcing it was launching a new editing app called Edits that appears to be a clone of CapCut. It will be available on Android next month.\nMeta also announced a slew of new Instagram Reels features last week that bring the app closer in line with TikTok, not all of which were welcomed by existing users. One is a new tab that lets people see what Reels their mutuals are liking and commenting on, as well as a “reply bar” to engage with that activity. Instagram users can also now upload Reels up to three minutes long, up from 90 seconds (TikTok allows clips up to 60 minutes).\nPerhaps the starkest change Instagram made, however, was to suddenly switch the shape of photos and videos on every user's profile from square to rectangular, mimicking how such content appears on TikTok. The move was met with swift backlash, and many Instagram creators complained that the aesthetic grids they had carefully cultivated over years on Instagram were now ruined.\nAdam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, acknowledged the negative feedback on Monday and said that the company would make it easier for users to customize their own feeds moving forward. “One of the mistakes I made was not giving people enough of a heads up,” he said in a post on Threads.\nIt’s not clear whether Meta’s strategy will be enough to convince loyal TikTok users to join its platforms or spend more time on them. During the hours that TikTok was inaccessible, Instagram and Facebook appeared to receive only a modest increase in daily active users and downloads, according to the market research firm Sensor Tower.\nAt least so far, many of Meta’s overtures have been met with suspicion. When TikTok came back online, conspiracy theories began spreading on the platform that Meta was going to take a stake in the company. Horrified creators specifically pointed to what they believed was a “new” official Facebook profile on TikTok as evidence. In reality, however, screenshots from the Internet Archive show that the account has existed since at least 2022.",

    "content_text": "Broadcast TV seems a little screwed. Viewership has been on a steady decline for the past two decades. More and more people get their entertainment and their news online. The biggest shows are coming to streaming first, and broadcast’s biggest shows are losing their big-name hosts. Naturally ad revenue is on a steady decline as well. Even Trump and his choice for Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, are rattling their sabers and threatening to pull the broadcast licenses of networks that run programs or news stories the White House doesn’t like.\nIt can feel like broadcast television will be gone tomorrow, and with it one of the only totally free sources of news and entertainment.\nThat’s what’s so crucial about broadcast TV. While it does require a television and a digital tuner to watch, there’s no monthly fee for internet or service, and unlike YouTube or Instagram, no company is collecting enormous amounts of data on you to sell to advertisers. It’s a completely passive experience. The stations air sports and news and entertainment, and you can tune in or not. And people are not tuning in.\n“Our expectation is it’s going to decline,” says Rose Oberman, media and entertainment director at S&P Global Ratings, though she noted that decline would happen over years, not months, and likened TV’s slide to what’s happened to radio over the past couple of decades. There’s no sudden collapse in broadcast TV’s future, just a steady chipping away as audiences move from paying for cable to paying for streaming.\nTake sports as an example. Events like the Olympics and the Super Bowl were once reliable audience drivers, but in 2024 the Super Bowl streamed on Paramount Plus. The experience was buggy and stuttering, but Paramount Plus still garnered 3.4 million more subscribers than it had before the game. The Olympics, which were simulcast on Peacock, experienced even more online success. People liked that they could just watch the events they wanted on demand and skip anything they didn’t.\nThen, at Christmas, sports streaming experienced its biggest event to date when Netflix successfully streamed two NFL games (and a flashy Beyoncé-starring half-time show). Nary a complaint of stuttering in sight. Afterward, Netflix claimed they were the most streamed games in NFL history.\nStreaming’s big sports win won’t immediately snuff out sports on broadcast TV—there are contracts in place keeping live games on the air. Yet as those contracts come up for renewal, leagues may opt to take their games elsewhere, particularly as broadcast becomes less profitable and viewers switch to streaming. Right now the networks spend billions to air NFL games, but companies like Netflix and Amazon have deeper pockets, and they’ve shown they have no problem paying big money to snatch rights out from under legacy media networks. Amazon agreed to pay $1 billion a year to secure the rights to NFL Thursday Night Football back in 2021. Fox was previously paying about $660 million annually for those games.\nThe belt-tightening has already hit another big money driver of network TV: the morning show. In early January, Hoda Kotb left the Today show after 17 years. The broadcast journalist was reportedly making more than $20 million a year as a host, and NBC just didn’t want to keep paying that. That’s also why the network axed the band on Late Night With Seth Meyers and dropped the number of weekly episodes of The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon from five to four. They’re all signs of what Variety called “TV’s new austerity push.”\n“We do have audiences going to different places to watch their programming,” one agent told Variety. “A number of these entities are seeing their revenues decline. That’s just a fact of life.”\nBut with broadcast TV’s audience now fractured across streaming, cable, and social media, why is Donald Trump threatening its existence? “This is a political cudgel being used against national news networks,” says David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Greene noted that Trump’s ire was focused more on national news outlets than the local stations that actually possess the broadcast licenses.\nSome networks do own local stations. Paramount, which also produces CBS’s 60 Minutes, owns a handful, and was even exploring selling 12 of them back in August before Trump lobbed his latest threats toward the network. But when I asked Oberman about those threats, she said she hadn’t “really heard it was an area of concern” for the industry. “If anything the incoming administration is more pro-friendly to the broadcasters.”\nPerry Sook, the CEO of Nexstar, the largest television station owner in the US, is hopeful that the new administration will remove rules capping the number of local stations a company can own. On a November 2024 earnings call, Sook clearly stated what kind of journalism he’d like to see on those stations. “[I]t seems as though there may be a kinder, gentler consensus emerging, that maybe fact-based journalism will come back into vogue, as well as eliminating the level of activist journalism out there,” he said on the call.\nSinclair, the second largest owner of TV stations in the US, is also eager for more consolidation, and has gained a reputation for directing its local stations to cover the news with a POV more in line with Sinclair’s own conservative political leanings. Sinclair was the subject of a 2018 viral video that showed dozens of newscasters from across the US reading the exact same script criticizing the media that repeated common conservative talking points.\nBut the Trump administration and the big owners of broadcast licenses aren’t just friendly because of their shared political leanings. According to Orman, local stations also tend to have better reach when it comes to political advertising. “Digital doesn’t seem to be giving political advertisers the return they’re expecting, and TV still seems to give that,” Orman told Ad Exchanger late last year. Broadcast TV actually saw its ad revenue increase by 9 percent in 2024, an uptick due entirely to increased spending on political ads during the major election cycle.\nWith the election in the rearview, that ad money is drying up. And with viewership fading and streaming outspending the networks hand over fist, one of the world’s oldest media institutions has its back against the wall. Even if the incoming administration fails to make good on its promise to punish media outlets that run stories it finds offensive, broadcast TV is entering a period of existential uncertainty.\n“Broadcast is so vulnerable right now,” says the EFF’s Greene, “any threat against it seems to be a danger.”",

But when I asked Oberman about those threats, she said she hadn’t “really heard it was an area of concern” for the industry. “If anything the incoming administration is more pro-friendly to the broadcasters.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Perry Sook, the CEO of Nexstar, the largest television station owner in the US, is hopeful that the new administration will remove rules capping the number of local stations a company can own.

    "content_text": "The video game industry has been in a troubled place for the past year, with studio closures and job security at the forefront of developer concerns. Increasing layoffs with seemingly no end paint a bleak picture for devs, while companies are busy pumping money into AI initiatives.\nAccording to a new report from the organizers of the Game Developers Conference, 52 percent of devs surveyed said they worked at companies that were using generative AI on their games. Of the 3,000 people surveyed, roughly half said they were concerned about the technology’s impact on the industry and an increasing number reported they felt negatively about AI overall. The “State of the Game Industry” report, released Tuesday, is one of a series of surveys conducted each year by GDC organizers prior to their annual conference. This year’s event will take place in San Francisco in March.\nThe 2025 GDC report comes on the heels of a tumultuous couple of years in the industry. Even as games like Astro Bot, Helldivers 2, and Balatro found success, studios like Microsoft and Sony have slashed staff and canceled games. Amid a mix of cultural and economic factors impacting the industry, developers are also still dealing with company enthusiasm for technology that some find ethically concerning.\n“I have a PhD in AI, worked to develop some of the algorithms used by generative AI,” one developer wrote. “I deeply regret how naively I offered up my contributions.”\nSome 30 percent of the developers who responded to the survey said they felt negatively about AI, opposed to 18 percent last year; only 13 percent believed AI was having a positive impact on games, down from 21 percent in 2024. “No matter how you put it, generative AI isn’t a great replacement for real people and quality is going to be damaged,” another developer wrote in their response.\nFor developers, AI has the potential to help with several tasks, respondents said, including coding, concept art, and 3D model generation, but when asked what uses they saw for AI in the industry, “the word used most frequently in their responses was ‘none,’” GDC organizers wrote.\nIn theory, generative AI could help some developers lighten their workloads. That’s not happening. Instead, developers are reportedly working longer hours than they have in years. Thirteen percent of respondents reported putting in 51-plus-hour weeks, up from 8 percent of respondents last year. While those additional hours could be attributed to devs taking on additional work to make up for colleagues lost during 2024’s massive industry-wide layoffs, many voiced concerns that AI was also a factor. “We should use generative AI to help people be faster at their jobs, not lose them,” one worker wrote.\nLayoffs, the story of the industry for the past several years, still pose a huge problem. “Survive till ’25,” the mantra for struggling developers, hardly helped those who did lose their jobs. According to the survey, one in 10 developers have been laid off over the last year. There was also an increase in “N/A” responses: “the question didn’t apply because they were already laid off or otherwise unemployed. In other words, it wasn’t a concern now because, in some way, it had already happened to them.”\nOf those who have already lost their jobs, many reported difficulty in finding new employment. Some said they were still out of work more than a year later, with one reporting they’d sent 500 applications to no avail. “I’ve been laid off before, but this was by far the longest it’s taken me to find work. It was scary, and my life was flipped upside down,” one developer wrote.\nSaid another: “I have been laid off three times in the last year. The first two times I was able to find a role. My current studio just laid everyone off. I was only there four months, and haven't found anything yet.”\nEven once they’ve landed a new job, it’s a coin toss on conditions. While one developer said they were able to quickly find another role in a better position, another said their new job is a “way worse pay level.”\nDevelopers blame problems like over-expansion in the wake of Covid-19, unrealistic expectations on game success, and poor leadership and mismanagement. “In this industry, we set impossible goals and then fire everyone if they prove to be impossible,” wrote one respondent. “We need to apply lean and agile processes instead of shooting for the moon every single time.”",

    "content_text": "On his first day in office, President Trump has signed a slew of executive orders that will set the United States on a radically different environmental path from the Biden administration. The executive orders and memoranda take the first steps to fulfilling many of Trump’s promises from the campaign trail: withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement, drilling more oil and natural gas, and repealing multiple Biden-era environmental directives and departments.\nWhile Trump’s day-one executive orders are far-reaching, it’s not yet clear how they will be implemented or how quickly they will be felt. Executive orders direct government agencies how to implement the law, but they can be challenged by courts if they appear to violate the US Constitution or other laws, as happened with Trump’s travel ban executive order in January 2017.\nTrump’s executive orders do, however, send a clear signal about his administration’s environmental priorities: extracting more fossil fuels, weakening support for green energy, and stepping away from global climate leadership.\nWithdrawing From the Paris Agreement\nThis executive order instructs the US Ambassador to the United Nations to submit formal notification that the US is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2016, commits countries to reduce greenhouse emissions and submit five-yearly updates on their climate plans to reach agreed goals on reducing emissions.\nIn his first term, Trump also withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement, although the terms of the agreement meant that the withdrawal did not take place until November 2020. In one of his very first acts as president, Joe Biden had the US rejoin the Paris Agreement. It will take at least a year for the US to leave the Agreement.\n“This short-sighted move shows a disregard for science and the well-being of people around the world, including Americans, who are already losing their homes, livelihoods, and loved ones as a result of climate change,” says Jonathan Foley, executive director of the climate charity Project Drawdown.\nThe executive order also rescinds the US International Climate Finance Plan—a Biden administration increase in international climate finance that reached over $11 billion a year by 2024. “Essentially it’s the world’s richest country turning its back on the the poorest countries at the time when they are suffering the most,” says Bob Ward, policy director at the London School of Economics’ Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change the the Environment.\nEncouraging Fossil Fuel Extraction\nPresident Trump dedicated three executive orders to making it easier for the US to exploit its vast fossil fuel reserves. On the campaign trail Trump consistently promised to “drill, baby, drill,” and in his first day as president he underscored this sloganeering with orders to remove Biden-era regulations and environmental rules that restrict fossil fuel exploration.\nOne executive order focuses specifically on Alaska, which has vast fossil fuel reserves and was the location for Willow—a controversial oil and gas project approved by the Biden administration in 2023. Trump’s executive order opens the doors wide open to other projects, calling for the US to “expedite the permitting and leasing of energy and natural resource projects” in Alaska and the revocation of any regulations passed by the Biden administration that may hinder this aim. It also specifically rescinds the cancellation of leases within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and withdraws an order from the Secretary of the Interior that temporarily paused oil and gas leasing in the refuge.\nA second executive order declared a national energy emergency, stating that the US energy production was “far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs.” The order instructs the heads of government agencies to use emergency authorities in order to identify, lease, and exploit domestic energy resources.\nA third executive order under the title “Unleashing American Energy” covers a wide range of policies, including encouraging energy production on federal land and waters, making the US the leader in non-fuel miners, including rare earth miners, and terminating state-level emissions waivers and subsidies for EVs. The order also promises to “safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose” lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, and other appliances, in an apparent nod to the controversy over New York’s law banning natural gas stoves in new homes and buildings.\n“The US will no longer be in a leadership position on these issues. It’s going to have real economic consequences for the US that will come back to bite President Trump before the end of this term,” says Ward, adding that the US will lose ground to China particularly in terms of electric vehicles and political leadership on climate change.\n“China will be the one now seen as being the world leader on this and will be able to establish lots of economic and diplomatic links with other countries at a time when the US will look to be completely hopeless on this issue.”\nSuspending New Offshore Wind Farms\nIn an executive memorandum, Trump suspended all new leasing for offshore wind farms, citing “growing demand for reliable energy” and “impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns.” The memorandum temporarily prevents the consideration of wind farm leases in areas on the US outer continental shelf—parts of the ocean floor that lie beyond state coastal waters.\nExecutive memoranda are similar to executive orders, but they are not required to cite the President’s legal authority, and the Office of Management and Budget is not required to issue a “Budgetary Impact Statement” as is the case with executive orders.\nRedirecting Water in California\nIn another memorandum, Trump picked up a policy from his first administration—a plan to route water from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta to other parts of the state. This plan was signed-off by Trump in 2020 but was challenged in court by California governor Gavin Newsom and the state of California. Trump has repeatedly blamed this delay on “worthless fish,” arguing that environmental rules have slowed the building of water infrastructure in California.\nThe memorandum—titled “Putting People Over Fish”—explicitly calls out “radical environmentalism,” which Trump implies is behind the delay to his infrastructure project. “This catastrophic halt was allegedly in protection of the Delta smelt and other species of fish,” the text of the memorandum reads.\nUndoing Biden-Era Climate Projects\nIn the same executive order that “unleashed” US fossil fuel exploitation, Trump revoked Biden-era executive orders and actions that set up new organizations to tackle climate change. This includes Executive Order 14008, which established a National Climate Task Force, most recently chaired by National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi.",

It will take at least a year for the US to leave the Agreement.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“This short-sighted move shows a disregard for science and the well-being of people around the world, including Americans, who are already <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/wildfires/\">losing their homes</a>, livelihoods, and loved ones as a result of climate change,” says Jonathan Foley, executive director of the climate charity Project Drawdown.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The executive order also rescinds the US International Climate Finance Plan—a Biden administration increase in international climate finance that reached over $11 billion a year by 2024. “Essentially it’s the world’s richest country turning its back on the the poorest countries at the time when they are suffering the most,” says Bob Ward, policy director at the London School of Economics’ Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change the the Environment.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Encouraging Fossil Fuel Extraction</h2><p class=\"paywall\">President Trump dedicated three executive orders to making it easier for the US to exploit its vast fossil fuel reserves. On the campaign trail Trump consistently promised to “drill, baby, drill,” and in his first day as president he underscored this sloganeering with orders to remove Biden-era regulations and environmental rules that restrict fossil fuel exploration.</p><p class=\"paywall\">One executive order focuses specifically on Alaska, which has vast fossil fuel reserves and was the location for Willow—a controversial oil and gas project approved by the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-administration-approves-willow-oil-project-alaska-2023-03-13/\">Biden administration in 2023</a>. Trump’s executive order opens the doors wide open to other projects, calling for the US to “expedite the permitting and leasing of energy and natural resource projects” in Alaska and the revocation of any regulations passed by the Biden administration that may hinder this aim. It also specifically rescinds the cancellation of leases within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and withdraws an order from the Secretary of the Interior that temporarily paused oil and gas leasing in the refuge.</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIt's totally understandable if you haven’t opened Apple Maps since its disastrous launch in 2012, which among other things saw people driving into riverbanks. It was not a launch that inspired confidence. That was over a decade ago, though, which is an eternity in the world of software. After years of refinement, Apple Maps is pretty good now.\nI switch between Google Maps and Apple Maps regularly, mostly as an experiment, and at this point I think Apple's product is just as reliable as Google's for turn-by-turn directions. Sure, Google is more likely to have a given business in its database, especially if that business is new. If you type the same address into both apps, though, they work about as well as each other for navigation.\nAnd I'll go even further: There are some things Apple Maps does better than Google. Not all of them are going to matter to all people, granted, but they exist. Here's a quick roundup.\nLittle Audio Details\nApple Maps, in my opinion, is better at explaining in plain language what you need to do next while you’re driving. For example: Google Maps, when a turn is upcoming, will tell you to turn at a specific street after a certain number of feet. This, while technically correct, almost always leaves me feeling confused. Apple Maps, meanwhile, will tell me to pass the next traffic light and turn right at the one after it. That, to me, is a much clearer instruction. There are a lot of similar interactions. It feels like having a really good navigator sitting next to you.\nI also generally find Apple's voices to be both clearer and more expressive, though that's possibly subjective.\nQuickly Check Transit Times\nApple Maps has a transit feature called \"Nearby transit\" that just shows a list of the incoming buses and trains near where I'm standing. I use this while waiting for a train at a stop and also when I'm almost ready to leave a bar or restaurant—I can quickly see the next few transit options and time my departure accordingly.\nGoogle doesn't offer a feature like this. You can ask for directions using transit, sure, and those directions will take arrival times into account. You can also get a list of arrival times if you tap a specific bus station, which is useful in some circumstances, but you can't just get a quick list of upcoming arrival times at all the stations near you, which is better if you’re trying to decide between multiple options. Google should probably steal this feature, since it's really nice to have.\nIntegration With Apple’s Ecosystem\nI'm a fan of messing around with Apple Shortcuts, the automation platform built into Apple devices. For example: I added a \"Save my parking spot\" button to my phone's homepage. I couldn't build a shortcut like that for Google Maps because Google doesn't offer any kind of Apple Shortcuts integration. This is just one example of how Google doesn't go out of its way to integrate with Apple's ecosystem.\nAnd then there are the integrations built into Apple apps and features. The calendar app on my Mac and iPhone default to opening maps when I tap an address. Siri defaults to using Maps if I ask for directions. If an Apple app offers directions it's going to work through Apple Maps. You could call this unfair, sure, but Google does the same thing on Android. Google Maps is tightly integrated with the rest of the company's mobile OS, and that integration can make life easier for people who use those native services.\nIt’s Just Cleaner\nGoogle Maps, over time, has had more and more stuff grafted onto it. Nothing makes this more obvious than opening both apps and noticing the contrast. Apple Maps sports fewer toolbars, fewer buttons, and in my opinion the geographic references offered on the map itself are more likely to be useful (possibly because, unlike with Google, fewer of them are paid advertisements).\nNow, I'm hardly the first person to point out that an Apple application is cleaner than a Google one, and I'll be the first to admit that the extent of this difference is subjective. But I think Apple's design does a better job of staying out of your way, which matters when you're just trying to get around.\nMe pointing these things out is not meant to imply that Google Maps does nothing better than Apple Maps. Google’s platform has a massive head start in terms of information about businesses, for one thing, and even after a decade Apple hasn't caught up. I've noticed this in particular during a recent trip to Peru, where Apple Maps was basically useless. I'm sure people will get in touch with me pointing out other things that Google does better, which is fine. I just mean to say that Apple Maps is pretty good now and that in a few ways I actually find it better than Google Maps.\nIf you haven't tried out Apple Maps in a while, I recommend you do. You might be surprised.",

    "content_text": "Fire has always shaped the landscape in California. But today it burns hotter, more frequently, and spreads farther than ever before—a shift driven by human development, climate change, and the prevalence of invasive species, which are non-native plants that have negative effects on local ecosystems. Grasses and trees brought to California for agriculture, landscaping, or by accident, have transformed the state’s fire dynamics.\n“Many non-native species can propagate fire faster than native plants,” says David Acuña, battalion chief for Cal Fire, the state’s department of forestry and fire protection. This transformation is an overlooked driver for the increasingly destructive wildfires in California and around the world.\nSouthern California is dominated by shrublands known as chaparral. This landscape was historically characterized by short, shrubby plants, and any native grasses were perennial, maintaining moisture and staying green for most of the year. Fires, when they occurred, were rare because lightning strikes were infrequent. When fires did ignite, they burned hot but wouldn’t spread far because the open gaps between plants acted as natural firebreaks.\nThe introduction of non-native grasses in the 1700s fundamentally altered this balance. Brought by European settlers, these grasses evolved alongside heavy livestock grazing and routine burning, making them highly resilient to disturbance. They outcompeted native species and filled the gaps in shrublands, creating a continuous carpet of flammable material, especially along altered areas like roadways—frequent starting points for fires.\nUnlike perennial native grasses, these non-native grasses are annuals, meaning they die each year and regrow from seeds. Their short life cycle leaves behind a dense layer of dry, dead vegetation by late spring. “They have such a high surface area to volume and are very flat and thin, so they maintain a lot of dead standing material, almost all year round,” says Carla D’Antonio, a plant community researcher and professor at UC Santa Barbara. By May, dead grass blankets the ground. “It’s so flammable that it takes any ignition—a cigarette, a spark from someone dragging a chain on the highway, or lightning,” says Hugh Safford, a vegetation and fire ecology researcher at UC Davis.\nThe grasses fill every available space—a phenomenon called fuel continuity. When fires spark, the uninterrupted line of dry vegetation acts like a wick, carrying the flames into the shrublands. “People underestimate the destructiveness of grasses because you can go hack them down with a hoe quickly, whereas a shrub is pretty hard to cut down,” says D’Antonio. “But if the sparks and embers fly into a bunch of introduced grasses, then—boom—everything around you just goes up like gasoline. It spreads so fast, and it’s so continuous. It’s like throwing tissue paper onto a fire.”\nEucalyptus trees, introduced to California in the mid-19th century from Australia, add another layer of fire risk. Known for their aromatic scent, these trees have incredibly flammable, oily leaves. Their papery bark sloughs off and catches in the wind, transporting embers up to half a mile away. The problem comes when people plant them right next to their home, says Acuña. “You put a very hot, very vigorous-burning plant like a eucalyptus tree next to a house, which is primarily composed of petroleum materials. That’s a very strong fire,” he explains.\nThe 1991 Tunnel Fire in Oakland, California, ignited debates—and multiple lawsuits—about whether to remove the widespread eucalyptus. “People want to keep them because they’re iconic, but wow, they are so freaking flammable,” says Safford. Yet in terms of a landscape-scale issue, Safford emphasizes that grasses remain a bigger concern.\nBut it’s not just California; invasive species have created fire hazards worldwide. Eucalyptus plantations have contributed to massive wildfires in Portugal, and grass fires have spread everywhere from the Great Basin in the American West to tropical forests in Chile. “It’s a major threat to native ecosystems around the world,” says Safford. “There’s a lot of international interest, so if someone could figure out just how to control grass, I think that would be quite a find.”\nVegetation management plays a critical role for fire mitigation: “The best way people are managing grass right now is just by hand-cutting roadsides and having crews out there every spring,” says D’Antonio. “I live in the mountains, and our community has a roadside group that goes out with volunteers and clears the roadsides and rakes off all that dead grass every year.” However, this shouldn’t be conflated with President Trump’s misleading claims from 2019 about “raking the forest floor” that resurfaced on social media during the LA wildfires. (It may work for tracts of grass along roadways, but not woody debris on forest floors.) And while raking is one method of vegetation management, effective fire prevention requires a broader approach, including controlled burns, strategic grazing, and clearing dead vegetation from key areas.\nIn some areas, sheep grazing is being tested as a low-impact way to manage grass growth. Some areas in Southern California are even testing a “BurnBot,” a machine that travels over the ground, performing controlled burns by torching anything directly underneath it—clearing both existing vegetation and plant seeds.\nD’Antonio and her graduate students are researching ways to replace these fire-prone areas with native grasses that are more fire-resilient. “Once they’re established, they’re fairly deep-rooted and they can access soil moisture deeper, so they stay more moist during the summer,” she explains. “Our goal is to create a community of native perennial grasses that can maintain itself so we don’t have to do constant maintenance.”\nHomeowners also have an important role to play. “Everybody wants to blame the Forest Service when a fire rips through, right? But we chose to live in this landscape,” says D’Antonio. “So start with your home.” Acuña says that Cal Fire provides tips for home- and landowners looking to fire-proof their property through landscaping and creating defensible space.\nUltimately, invasive plants are a problem that requires collective action—community involvement, responsible land-management practices, and forward-thinking research to restore native ecosystems. Without these efforts, California’s wildfire crisis will only intensify, fueled by plants never meant to be here in the first place.",

    "content_text": "After the presidential election, many fashion and lifestyle influencers began to come out of the closet as conservatives. Some, like tradwife TikTok darling Nara Smith, were predictable, while others were less so. But what was clear was that MAGA culture, and the fashion and aesthetics associated with it, were becoming increasingly mainstream.\nInauguration weekend, with its mix of parties and formal events, brought together the who’s who of right-wing players. Observing the proceedings was Derek Guy, known online as @dieworkwear—a longtime menswear enthusiast and writer who has came to prominence as an influencer on X for his hot and unnervingly well-informed takes on the sartorial choices of everyone from Donald Trump to Andrew Tate, and what they might be telling us about this political moment.\nWIRED spoke with Guy after Monday’s inauguration ceremony to get his takes on MAGA fashion, what it says about who the party is for, and what the richest men alive are wearing these days.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nWIRED: First, give us the reviews of the inauguration suits and ties. What are we looking at here? These are some of the richest men in the world, but I’m not sure they really look like it.\nDerek Guy: You can break up the inauguration almost by age. The older someone is, the more likely they are at least avoiding the worst of what we're seeing. And the younger someone is, the more likely they are wearing something that looks cheap, because tailoring as a craft has mostly died in this country. Many people shop ready-to-wear. And when you're very wealthy, you are probably just buying a luxury-level off-the-rack suit. And just because something is made with fine materials doesn't necessarily mean it fits. So you have a market system that makes it difficult to find a good suit.\nIf you're younger, like Mark Zuckerberg's age, you're more likely to kind of fall into this short-jacket silhouette that you think looks modern and hip but frankly looks really dated and makes you actually look more middle-aged, like someone who learned how to dress in the early 2000s.\nVivek [Ramaswamy], for example, wears really shrunken suits. Jeff Bezos often wears pretty good tailoring but today wore a very short jacket which did not look very good on him. He looked surprisingly bad today, given how he looks in tailored clothing other times.\nElon Musk, I'm pretty sure he wears a Tom Ford suit, because that's five buttons on the cuffs. I thought it looked pretty good on him, but he looked bad at the rally last night. He was wearing a short overcoat with gray jeans, and it didn’t flatter him very well. The outfit didn’t make much sense.\nZuckerberg, his suits are neither fantastic nor horrible. Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, they are still clearly nerds who don’t care about clothes.\nBut, you know, for example, JD Vance has a custom tailor. He has a 90-year-old Italian tailor in Ohio. That guy is not following fashion trends.\nWhy do the rank-and-file MAGA enthusiasts favor such slim-fit suits when Trump himself often wears things that are quite baggy?\nWhat you're seeing is young conservatives will often wear very shrunken suits because they care more about the tailored aesthetic. Ironically, you actually look better if you're the kind of young Democrat who doesn't care about aesthetics at all. So then you wear a sloppy suit. You still look bad, but you essentially avoid the shrunken look. The MAGA aesthetic will change over time as conservatives change their tastes naturally. But I mean, just to be frank about it, many conservatives are often behind on fashion trends.\nWe are at this moment where the large part of the market has shifted away from the shrunken look of the early 2000s. But if you're kind of behind on fashion trends, you still think that looks good.\nAre you seeing changes to the hallmarks of the MAGA aesthetic, particularly as we're seeing it merge a bit with the quiet luxury vibe that became very popular online?\nMAGA is a very populist aesthetic, so it's intentionally vulgar and thumbing its nose at WASP morality and aesthetics, even though within the Republican Party there is still that kind of celebration of bourgeois 1950s aesthetics.\nI often like to contrast it. When Ronald Reagan and George Bush were first inaugurated in 1980, the Republican Party commissioned custom blazer buttons commemorating their inauguration, and they gave them out for free to attendees at the various events surrounding the inauguration. So if you attended Reagan's inauguration in 1980, you would have gotten a brass button commemorating the inauguration, made by Ben Silver in Charleston, South Carolina. It was presumed that people who attended Reagan's inauguration would have a navy tailored jacket. And if you put brass buttons on a navy jacket then that jacket becomes a blazer. It was presumed that not only would young Republicans have a navy jacket, but that they would want to wear a blazer with a button commemorating Reagan's victory.\nThe merchandise surrounding Trump's movement is gold sneakers and Never Surrender T-shirts and, of course, the red MAGA hat.\nTo me, this demonstrates the schism between the classic Republican—which is the Brooks Brothers, free-trade, globalist, Reaganite Republican—and the new Republican, which is populist. They pay reverence to Reagan, but they don't share his politics.\nThe aesthetic is very much not the classic WASP aesthetic, which used to be the Republican aesthetic. Trump's own aesthetic comes from the 1980s—the “greed is good” of Wall Street boom times. He wears very padded shoulders and a power tie. He used to wear a banker collar, but no longer. And that's very different from the demure look of Brooks Brothers WASP. MAGA is a very aggressive, populist “fuck you” to the establishment aesthetic.\nWhen you think about the MAGA aesthetic, are there particular brands or influencers who come to mind for you?\nIt's all very campaign merch, and the most mainstream item is just the MAGA hat. It still seems very much like campaign merch. I don't think there's anyone else that sets the tone except for Trump. There are certain people that embody that look very well. Forgiato Blow, he has that kind of very loud aesthetic. There was a moment where Viper sunglasses were very popular, which was, I think, driven by Baked Alaska. So there are microtrends in that universe. But it’s really Trump—whatever he releases next, people will wear.\nDo you think that sort of classic American look—the Ralph Lauren, the oxford shirt—is that going to be sort of the purview of MAGA forever, or do you see that changing?\nI don't think the classic American aesthetic is strictly MAGA, though. I think a Brooks Brothers look is like the ABC of menswear; that's like a very classic American tailored look. In the postwar period, right after the end of the Second World War, there was a culture clash between establishment lifestyle–the man in a gray flannel suit who works in a corporate job and has a conventional kind of nuclear family and white-picket-fence house—and the counterculture. That was this kind of liberal side of the political spectrum. They wore work wear and chambray shirts, hippie gear, motorcycle jackets. That all became counterculture.\nBut if you go back further than that, everyone wore tailored clothing, from criminals to CEOs to liberals and Republicans. Ralph Lauren could not have built his empire if button-down shirts and penny loafers were exclusively conservative attire.\nI think it's interesting that the current status of Republican politics is trying to unite the Brooks Brothers aesthetic with the gold sneakers. Do you see them coming together?\nI think that's the weird dichotomy at the moment, because the MAGA movement and Republicans in general have always been kind of looking back toward some idea of America. Even though not every man wore a suit in the 1950s, the suit has historically been associated with the kind of bourgeois lifestyle. And a lot of conservatism in general is about upholding bourgeois lifestyles, morality, identity, politics, and so forth.\nThere is now a populist section of the Republican Party that's not about Reaganism or Bush. It's very about Trump. And its aesthetic is very different from what William Buckley would have worn. William Buckley would not have worn gold sneakers.\nI think they are distinct and contradictory, but people can hold contradictory ideas in their head. We are in an age where politics is very tribal. And so long as it fits the narrative of our tribe, then I think it's coherent for that group. For Republicans, I think those two very contradictory aesthetics are just now within the party.\nThe men of tech are new to the MAGA crowd, but many people have noted a significant change in their looks, particularly Mark Zuckerberg’s. Can you talk about what they’re trying to signal and to whom?\nI heard through the grapevine within my industry that [Elon Musk] used to have a stylist. I don’t think he has a stylist anymore. Mark Zuckerberg denies having a stylist, but I don’t believe him. He is certainly going through a style transformation in the last year and three months, I would say. Jeff Bezos most obviously has a stylist. I don't think what they're doing has anything to do with politics. I think Jeff Bezos went through a style makeover after his divorce. And I suspect Mark Zuckerberg just got tired of dressing like a college student. Elon has clearly given up on his stylist and doesn’t dress very well.\n[Zuckerberg] dresses more like an MMA guy. He is wearing the boxy tees and the gold chain. But he looks like someone who updated his look to be trendier. There are a lot of guys wearing that kind of silhouette and gold chain, and I don’t know that that says anything about their politics.\nWe saw a lot of the sort of “spaghetti Western” vibe happening. What’s your take on that?\nAs a fashion trend, the Western look really leans more liberal, right now, because it’s popular in big cities. Conservatives now dress like metrosexuals in the early 2000s, and liberals dress like Bush-era conservatives.

    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Do you think that sort of classic American look—the Ralph Lauren, the oxford shirt—is that going to be sort of the purview of MAGA forever, or do you see that changing?</strong></p><p class=\"paywall\">I don't think the classic American aesthetic is strictly MAGA, though. I think a Brooks Brothers look is like the ABC of menswear; that's like a very classic American tailored look. In the postwar period, right after the end of the Second World War, there was a culture clash between establishment lifestyle–the man in a gray flannel suit who works in a corporate job and has a conventional kind of nuclear family and white-picket-fence house—and the counterculture. That was this kind of liberal side of the political spectrum. They wore work wear and chambray shirts, hippie gear, motorcycle jackets. That all became counterculture.</p><p class=\"paywall\">But if you go back further than that, everyone wore tailored clothing, from criminals to CEOs to liberals and Republicans. Ralph Lauren could not have built his empire if button-down shirts and penny loafers were exclusively conservative attire.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>I think it's interesting that the current status of Republican politics is trying to unite the Brooks Brothers aesthetic with the gold sneakers. Do you see them coming together?</strong></p><p class=\"paywall\">I think that's the weird dichotomy at the moment, because the MAGA movement and Republicans in general have always been kind of looking back toward some idea of America. Even though not every man wore a suit in the 1950s, the suit has historically been associated with the kind of bourgeois lifestyle. And a lot of conservatism in general is about upholding bourgeois lifestyles, morality, identity, politics, and so forth.</p><p class=\"paywall\">There is now a populist section of the Republican Party that's not about Reaganism or Bush. It's very about Trump. And its aesthetic is very different from what William Buckley would have worn. William Buckley would not have worn gold sneakers.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I think they are distinct and contradictory, but people can hold contradictory ideas in their head. We are in an age where politics is very tribal. And so long as it fits the narrative of our tribe, then I think it's coherent for that group. For Republicans, I think those two very contradictory aesthetics are just now within the party.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>The men of tech are new to the MAGA crowd, but many people have noted a significant change in their looks, particularly Mark Zuckerberg’s. Can you talk about what they’re trying to signal and to whom?</strong></p><p class=\"paywall\">I heard through the grapevine within my industry that [Elon Musk] used to have a stylist. I don’t think he has a stylist anymore. Mark Zuckerberg denies having a stylist, but I don’t believe him. He is certainly going through a style transformation in the last year and three months, I would say. Jeff Bezos most obviously has a stylist. I don't think what they're doing has anything to do with politics. I think Jeff Bezos went through a style makeover after his divorce. And I suspect Mark Zuckerberg just got tired of dressing like a college student. Elon has clearly given up on his stylist and doesn’t dress very well.</p><p class=\"paywall\">[Zuckerberg] dresses more like an MMA guy. He is wearing the boxy tees and the gold chain. But he looks like someone who updated his look to be trendier. There are a lot of guys wearing that kind of silhouette and gold chain, and I don’t know that that says anything about their politics.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>We saw a lot of the sort of “spaghetti Western” vibe happening. What’s your take on that?</strong></p><p class=\"paywall\">As a fashion trend, the Western look really leans more liberal, right now, because it’s popular in big cities. Conservatives now dress like metrosexuals in the early 2000s, and liberals dress like Bush-era conservatives. Conservatives are in slim-tight suits or slim-fit suits, and then liberals are like Carhartt double-knees, Western shirts, cowboy boots. There is some of this inherently on the right because it's a Midwestern look.</p><p class=\"paywall\">But Elon Musk does wear cowboy boots pretty frequently, as does Jeff Bezos.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Shortly after Monday’s inauguration ceremony, President Donald Trump signed an executive order extending the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US operations, preventing the app from going dark for an additional 75 days.\nThe executive order instructs the US Attorney General to abstain from enforcing the law that would ban the app and require companies like Apple and Google to remove it from their app stores. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDays before the January 19 deadline, Trump suggested that he would “save” the app once he formally took office. In an interview with Kristen Welker at NBC News on Saturday, Trump said that he would give ByteDance more time to find a buyer but did not explain how he planned to do so. “We have to look at it carefully. It’s a very big situation,” he said.\nIn a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump confirmed that the extension would be done by way of an executive order that would allow his administration to negotiate a deal with ByteDance. In his post, Trump said that he would pursue a 50 percent joint venture agreement with ByteDance, preferably with a US entity.\n“By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to [stay] up,” Trump wrote. “Without US approval, there is no TikTok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars—maybe trillions.”\nByteDance and TikTok have yet to publicly respond to Trump’s proposal. At the Monday signing ceremony, Trump said that he thinks TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew would “really like it.” Trump said private companies could be involved in financing the negotiation. “I think you have a lot of people that will be interested in TikTok with the United States as a partner,” he said.\nThe executive order itself doesn't mention divestiture but instead says that the 75-day reprieve is for the “opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way.”\nThe rush to keep TikTok online came after the company suffered a devastating blow at the hands of the US Supreme Court. On Friday, the court upheld a law forcing a sale of TikTok to an American owner in order to stave off a nationwide ban. The decision came only two days before the law was set to go into effect.\nShortly before midnight on Saturday, TikTok users received a notification alerting them that the app was no longer available to US users as a result of the sell-or-ban law. Around the same time Apple and Google removed the app from their app stores, other ByteDance-owned apps, including CapCut, Lemon8, and Marvel Snap, were also taken down. TikTok was down for around 15 hours before the company issued a statement announcing that it would return.\n“In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,” the company said Sunday evening.\nThe divestiture law has faced resentment from both sides of the aisle. “In Washington DC doing meetings trying to get this TikTok ban lifted,” wrote Soulja Boy in a post on X over the weekend. The rap artist was in town to perform at a crypto industry inauguration party.\nA variety of American financiers considered buying the app, including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and former Trump treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin. McCourt’s Project Liberty made a formal bid after the Supreme Court announced its decision. Elon Musk’s name was also floated in talks about a deal with the Chinese government, according to Bloomberg.\nOn Monday, Trump suggested that he could impose retaliatory tariffs against China if the Chinese government refuses to negotiate a deal resolving the US government’s national security concerns with TikTok. “I’m not saying I would, but you could certainly do it,” he said.",

    "content_text": "Four Proud Boy leaders convicted of seditious conspiracy are among the hundreds of Capitol rioters who will walk free following pardons and sentence commutations issued by newly inaugurated president Donald Trump.\nEnrique Tarrio, who was the leader of the far-right gang at the time of the insurrection four years ago, had been sentenced to 22 years behind bars—the longest sentence received by any January 6 rioter. He received a pardon. His codefendants Zachary Rehl, Joseph Biggs, and Ethan Nordean, who were previously sentenced to 15, 17, and 18 years, had their sentences commuted and were ordered released as of Monday.\nTarrio’s mother Zuny Duarte told WIRED that Enrique will be back in Miami by 3 pm on Tuesday. He’s been serving his sentence at a federal prison in Pollock, Louisiana.\nTrump issued 14 sentence commutations and issued blanket pardons for all other individuals convicted in relation to the Capitol riot. Around 1,580 individuals in total were charged with crimes related to January 6.\n“These people have been destroyed, what they’ve done to these people is outrageous, there’s rarely been anything like it in the history of this country,” Trump said of the January 6-ers from the Oval Office. He also floated conspiracy theories that “outside agitators” and the FBI were somehow responsible for the violence that unfolded on January 6. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, who was also convicted of seditious conspiracy, also had his sentence commuted and will walk free.\nTrump had teased the pardons at his event earlier Monday at the Capital One Arena, promising an imminent release of “J6 hostages.”\n“Ooh, you’re going to be happy reading newspapers tomorrow and the next day and the next day,” he said.\nReached by phone earlier on Monday, Duarte told WIRED that they were anticipating Enrique’s release. “The guys are excited and think that justice will finally come to us,” said Duarte. “Donald Trump knows what it’s like to be on the side of the prosecuted and on the unjust side of things.”\nAsked whether Tarrio was still involved with the Proud Boys, Duarte responded: “That’s a question you need to ask him when he’s out.”\nBefore Trump had even put ink to paper, news that correctional facilities were beginning to process January 6 rioters for release had started percolating online. Social media accounts linked to the Proud Boys were jubilant, and Gavin McInnes, who founded the Proud Boys in 2016, declared “Party for the Boys” on a livestream of his show while collecting donations to support released members of the gang.\nAs a first-day act, it was a stunningly symbolic one. Four years ago, on January 6, 2021, thousands of Trump’s supporters galvanized by conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, came to DC and besieged the Capitol with the goal of preventing the peaceful transfer of power. The ugly scenes culminated in the deaths of five people and left more than 140 police officers injured, and Trump left Washington in disgrace.\nWeeks later, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the US behind riot barriers, barbed wire, and under the eyes of more than 25,000 national guard troops.\nThe FBI classified the Capitol riot as an act of domestic terrorism, and the DOJ has spent the years since trying to hold those involved in the riot to account, a massive and costly undertaking. Nearly 1,600 defendants have been hit with federal charges in connection to the riot.\nTrump has also been scrutinized for his role in the riot. In a recently released report, special counsel Jack Smith says that Trump would have surely faced criminal charges for his efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 election had he not won the presidential election in 2024. That would include, Smith wrote, directing “an angry mob to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification of the presidential election and then leverage rioters’ violence to further delay it.”\nOver the course of his 2024 campaign, Trump yoked his own litany of legal woes to those faced by the January 6 rioters, whom he started calling “hostages” of Joe Biden’s administration. In early 2022, he began floating the possibility of pardons for January 6-ers.\nIn addition to announcing pardons and commutations for rioters, Trump theatrically signed a flurry of executive orders from a desk set upon a stage in the Capital One Arena, including one “ENDING THE WEAPONIZATION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.” That order asserts that “the American people have witnessed the previous administration engage in a systematic campaign against its perceived political opponents.”",

Some elections are important, some are not, but this one really mattered,” Musk said during his address inside the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, hours after Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. “And I just want to say thank you for making it happen. Thank you.”\nAt this point, Musk put his right hand on his chest before extending it straight out with his palm facing down and his fingers touching, a gesture widely recognized as the “Roman salute.” Adopted by the fascist movement a century ago, it was most famously used by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany, and is to this day associated with the fascist right, especially in Italy.\nAfter he first made the gesture, Musk then turned around to members of the crowd who were seated behind him and, with his back to the camera, repeated the gesture.\n“My heart goes out to you,” Musk added.\nMusk subsequently shared a clip of his speech on X, but at the point where he makes the first salute, the clip posted by Musk cuts away to a shot of the audience before returning to show him making the second salute.\nMusk, X, and the Trump administration did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but after this article was published Musk responded to the backlash in a post on X, writing: “Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.”\nThe response from the neo-Nazi community across the globe was instant and unanimous.\n“Incredible things are happening already,” Andrew Torba, the founder of Gab, a social media platform popular with antisemites and white supremacists, wrote over a picture of Musk giving the salute.\n“The entire neo-Nazi movement seems to be eating it up,” says Nick Martin, an investigative journalist who closely tracks extremist groups and runs the online publication The Informant. “He gave two unmistakable Nazi salutes, and they got the message loud and clear.”\n“WE ARE FUCKING BACK,” the administrator of a Nazi meme channel on Telegram wrote under a clip of Musk giving the salute. Members of the group responded with the lightning bolt emoji, a well-known neo-Nazi reference to the SS.\n“I don’t care if this was a mistake, I’m going to enjoy the tears over it,” Christopher Pohlhaus, the leader of the American neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, wrote on his Telegram channel under a gif of the Musk salute.\nKeith Woods, a prominent far-right influencer from Ireland who has repeatedly praised Musk, responded to the actions by writing on X: “OK maybe woke really is dead.”\nEvan Kilgore, a right-wing political commentator, wrote on X: “Holy crap … did Elon Musk just Heil Hitler at the Trump Inauguration Rally in Washington DC … This is incredible.” Kilgore later wrote: “We are so back.”\nKilgore, who is a Holocaust denier, has worked as an ambassador for Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA. The conservative activist group hosted a pre-inauguration ball on Sunday evening that featured JD Vance, who was inaugurated as vice president today, and the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr.\nMusk has embraced far-right ideology and figures across the globe, including jailed Islamphobic activist Tommy Robinson in the UK, over the last two years. Most recently, he has promoted the German far-right political party Alternative for Germany. In an hour-long interview with the party’s leader, Alice Weidel, earlier this month, Musk agreed with the wild conspiracy theory that Hitler was a communist.\nThis article has been updated with a post from Elon Musk.",

    "content_text": "Late Friday evening, three days before his return to the Oval Office, Donald Trump performed an act of crypto alchemy. Pretty much all it took was a few strokes of the keyboard. “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE!” the incoming US president wrote in a Truth Social post. “It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!”\nThe post marked the launch of Trump’s very own memecoin—a type of joke cryptocurrency that typically has no purpose beyond financial speculation, whose value tends to whipsaw dramatically with changes in public sentiment.\nThe price of the TRUMP memecoin began to hare upwards almost immediately, despite speculation that Trump’s account had been hacked. By the following day, the coins released into circulation—20 percent of the total supply—were valued at $14 billion.\nOn Sunday, first lady Melania Trump followed with a memecoin of her own. At the time of writing, the circulating MELANIA coins are worth nearly $1 billion.\nBy virtue of the vast amounts of the TRUMP coin held back by Trump-affiliated entities, the incoming US president was suddenly connected to crypto coins with a theoretical value of more than $50 billion. The memecoin accounts for almost 90 percent of Trump’s net worth, Axios calculated.\nSome crypto boosters have celebrated the Trump family’s foray into memecoins, applauding the new president’s ability to transmute his fame into crypto wealth. But others have pointed to the thorny ethical issues at play; for Trump to enrich himself, someone else must pay.\n“Memecoins is absolutely a PvP [Player vs Player] game,” said Azeem Khan, cofounder of the Morph blockchain and venture partner at crypto VC firm Foresight Ventures, in an interview with WIRED late last year. “For someone to win, someone has to lose.”\nIn this case, Trump’s own supporters stand to potentially bear the cost. “It’s blatantly unethical,” alleges Christopher Bendiksen, a researcher at crypto asset management firm CoinShares. “Knowing that a bunch of [supporters] will lose money—and that money ends up in your pocket. Especially when you are holding the presidency of the United States.”\nThe press office for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe remaining 80 percent of TRUMP coins not yet released into circulation belong to two Trump-affiliated organizations: CIC Digital LLC—which has previously flogged Trump-branded sneakers, NFTs, and other merchandise—and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which was incorporated in early January. These organizations will receive the coins incrementally over a three-year period, the website states, generating revenue “derived from trading activities”—a euphemism for selling off the coins.\nIn theory, increasing the number of coins in circulation and making large individual sales puts a downward pressure on price, increasing supply without any change in demand. As the Trump organizations enrich themselves through the sale of tokens, other investors—at least some of whom are presumably die-hard Trump supporters—may therefore suffer a fall in the value of their coins.\nIn this sense, claims Jacob Silverman, coauthor of Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud, the TRUMP coin setup seems to bear some of the hallmarks of a “classic memecoin pump-and-dump”—a maneuver whereby an issuer keeps hold of large amounts of their coin, promotes the project, then cashes in their holdings, devaluing the coin and dealing huge losses to other investors.“When you have an insider distribution of 80 percent, the risk that it is going to be dumped on the public or that there will be some kind of major sell-off is just massive. It’s a huge red flag,” alleges Silverman. “Unfortunately, some poor saps are going to get soaked.” (Pump-and-dumps occupy something of a legal gray area, legal experts say, but are roundly condemned as ethically dubious.)\nMelania Trump’s decision to release her own memecoin appears to have already dealt a blow to TRUMP investors, even absent any alleged potential pump-and-dump. After the MELANIA coin went live, the TRUMP token fell in price by 50 percent.\nThe litany of unofficial Trump-inspired memecoins—among them MAGA, MAGA Hat, Doland Tremp and Super Trump—have tumbled in value too. During the 2024 election cycle, political memecoins were used as a proxy for betting on the outcome of the election and expressing support for a particular candidate, rising and falling with events on the campaign trail. But the launch of TRUMP has inadvertently decimated inventors who bought unofficial coins as a mark of their support for Trump.\n“I do not think this is appropriate for the president of the United States,” says Steven Steele, marketing director for the MAGA token, in a video posted to X. “This just seems like an egregious money grab.”\nPerhaps more dangerous than financial losses brought upon supporters, the Trump memecoin could also act as a new vector for bribery, claims Silverman. By investing large sums into a cryptocurrency in which Trump has a large financial interest, thereby driving up its price, politically motivated actors could curry favor with the president without any sort of direct transaction taking place, he alleges. “These are kinds of channels for influence and leverage of a kind we haven’t really seen before,” claims Silverman.\nThe release of an official Trump memecoin marks the latest development in the president’s ongoing flirtation with crypto. Though in his first term Trump rejected bitcoin as a “scam,” he performed a complete volte-face in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election. As crypto industry figureheads endorsed his presidency and threw hundreds of millions of dollars in donations at pro-crypto super PACs, Trump began to pitch himself as the “crypto president.”\nIn July, speaking to thousands of bitcoiners at a conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump promised to turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet” and establish a national “bitcoin stockpile” if reelected. Then in September, the Trump family helped to launch a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, which they pitched as a way to “make finance great again.” (It remains unclear what services World Liberty Financial will provide.)\nWorld Liberty Financial was met with skepticism by some members of the crypto industry, who worried that the project could lead to losses among investors and deal lasting reputational damage should it fail. The same logic applies to the TRUMP memecoin. “If this totally blows up in a lot of people’s faces, it will be super bad, because the media attention will be negative,” says Bendiksen.\nYet for all the potential consequences, there is little to prevent Trump from testing the boundaries of what is acceptable with crypto, says Silverman, as others have done before him. Particularly as he prepares to overhaul the SEC, the financial regulator that most energetically pursued the crypto industry under the previous administration.\n“In some ways, he’s just another crypto entrepreneur,” says Silverman. “He just happens to be the president.”",

    "content_text": "As President Donald Trump was sworn into office as the 47th President of the United States on Monday, grifters and opportunists were already seeking to cash in on the new Trump era—including the president himself.\nJust days before he took office, Trump launched a memecoin called $TRUMP to “celebrate our win and have fun,\" warning that it was “not intended to be … an investment opportunity.” Trump announced the launch on X and Truth Social, with many wondering if the president’s accounts had been hacked.\nHowever, within hours, thousands had invested in the cryptocurrency. The sale was so successful that, at billions of dollars, it accounted for almost 90 percent of Trump’s overall wealth. However, like a lot of memecoins, the $TRUMP coin’s price fluctuated wildly and dipped significantly on Sunday, with the price drop continuing into Monday.\nAt the time he was sworn in as president on Monday, the $TRUMP memecoin was worth just shy of $50 billion, with Trump retaining 80 percent of the coins. The coin, which is built on the Solana blockchain, allows anyone anywhere in the world to funnel money directly to the US president.\nFirst Lady Melania Trump also launched her own memecoin on Sunday, and while it hasn’t reached the level of Trump’s memecoin, the $MELANIA coin was worth almost $8 billion on Monday.\nThe president and first lady were far from the only ones seeking to cash in on the buzz around Trump’s second term, and the inauguration weekend in particular. Since his first term in office, Trump has been a magnet for all types of grifts and cash grabs, many of them endorsed by the president himself, and including everything from guitars and shoes to trading cards and coins.\nReligion has also been on the table. Lee Greenwood, a country singer, said on Sunday that Trump could use a special edition of the “God Bless The USA” bible for his swearing in—the same bible the singer has been selling with Trump since last March.\nThe “Inauguration Day Edition Bible” has been on sale on Greenwood’s own website—alongside hot-pink and camo versions of the bible—for $70 for the last week, but as Trump took office on Monday, the bible appeared to have already sold out.\nA raft of other commemorative items are on sale, ranging from dozens of “Inauguration Day” T-shirts and hats being sold on platforms like Amazon and Etsy to a special “Inauguration Edition” roast from Victory Coffee. A Texas-based jeweler is even offering to gift the president an 8-carat diamond in the shape of his head in what appears to be a marketing bid.\nAnd because Trump’s inauguration was moved indoors due to severe cold weather, tens of thousands of people who had been sent tickets to attend the event were unable to use them. People have attempted to cash in on those tickets, with dozens of listings on eBay offering the unused tickets for up to $200 each. The tickets were distributed free by members of the House of Representatives and feature a hologram and the signature of the representative whose office issued them. Many of the listings have already been sold, with some sellers offering multiple tickets.\nA specific website offering commemorative inaugural tickets was also set up, with some tickets offered for as much as $900. It is unclear who is behind the page, but the site is ranked as the second result on a Google search for \"commemorative inauguration tickets.”\nGrifting and cash grabs in Trumpworld are nothing new. Ever since Trump came to office in 2016, he and his sycophantic supporters have embraced a wide variety of schemes.

The sale was so successful <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/19/donald-trump-crypto-billionaire\">that, at billions of dollars, it accounted for almost 90</a> percent of Trump’s overall wealth. However, like a lot of memecoins, the $TRUMP coin’s price fluctuated wildly and dipped significantly on Sunday, with the price drop continuing into Monday.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">At the time he was sworn in as president on Monday, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://solscan.io/token/6p6xgHyF7AeE6TZkSmFsko444wqoP15icUSqi2jfGiPN\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://solscan.io/token/6p6xgHyF7AeE6TZkSmFsko444wqoP15icUSqi2jfGiPN\" href=\"https://solscan.io/token/6p6xgHyF7AeE6TZkSmFsko444wqoP15icUSqi2jfGiPN\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the $TRUMP memecoin was worth</a> just shy of $50 billion, with Trump retaining 80 percent of the coins. The coin, which is built on the Solana blockchain, allows anyone anywhere in the world to funnel money directly to the US president.</p><p class=\"paywall\">First Lady Melania Trump also launched her own memecoin on Sunday, and while it hasn’t reached the level of Trump’s memecoin, the <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://solscan.io/token/FUAfBo2jgks6gB4Z4LfZkqSZgzNucisEHqnNebaRxM1P\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://solscan.io/token/FUAfBo2jgks6gB4Z4LfZkqSZgzNucisEHqnNebaRxM1P\" href=\"https://solscan.io/token/FUAfBo2jgks6gB4Z4LfZkqSZgzNucisEHqnNebaRxM1P\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$MELANIA coin</a> was worth almost $8 billion on Monday.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The president and first lady were far from the only ones seeking to cash in on the buzz around Trump’s second term, and the inauguration weekend in particular. Since his first term in office, Trump has been a magnet for all types of grifts and cash grabs, many of them endorsed by the president himself, and including everything from guitars and shoes to trading cards and coins.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Religion has also been on the table. Lee Greenwood, a country singer, said on Sunday that Trump could use a special edition of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-god-bless-usa-bible-greenwood-2713fda3efdfa297d0f024efb1ca3003\">“God Bless The USA” bible</a> for his swearing in—the same bible the singer has been selling with Trump since last March.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The “Inauguration Day Edition Bible” has been on sale on Greenwood’s own website—alongside hot-pink and camo versions of the bible—for $70 for the last week, but as Trump took office on Monday, the bible appeared to have already sold out.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A raft of other commemorative items are on sale, ranging from dozens of “Inauguration Day” T-shirts and hats being sold on platforms like Amazon and Etsy to a special “Inauguration Edition” roast from Victory Coffee. A Texas-based jeweler is even offering to gift the president an 8-carat diamond in the shape of his head in what appears to be a marketing bid.</p><p class=\"paywall\">And because Trump’s inauguration was moved indoors due to severe cold weather, tens of thousands of people who had been sent tickets to attend the event were unable to use them. People have attempted to cash in on those tickets, with dozens of listings on eBay offering the unused tickets for up to $200 each. The tickets were distributed free by members of the House of Representatives and feature a hologram and the signature of the representative whose office issued them. Many of the listings have already been sold, with some sellers offering multiple tickets.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A specific website offering commemorative inaugural tickets was also set up, with some tickets offered for as much as $900. It is unclear who is behind the page, but the site is ranked as the second result on a Google search for \"commemorative inauguration tickets.”</p><p class=\"paywall\"><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/impersonators-take-advantage-as-the-trumps-dawdle-over-crypto-reveal/\">Grifting</a> and cash grabs in Trumpworld are nothing new. Ever since Trump came to office in 2016, he and his sycophantic supporters have embraced a wide variety of schemes. With Trump support, many figures have made entire careers grifting on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/election-fraud-conspiracies-flooding-social-media/\">topics like stolen elections</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-strange-twisted-tale/\">Covid denialism</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>",

The Chinese lifestyle and travel app, which has over 300 million mostly monthly active users, surged to the top of US app store charts last week as the TikTok ban approached.\nIn a campaign brief obtained by WIRED, Solare Global, a marketing agency based in New York City, pitched creators on making sponsored posts for RedNote featuring videos of themselves telling their followers about the Chinese app’s sudden rise in the US. The brief asked creators to describe “how fun and engaging the app is” and “emphasize its user-friendly design and international appeal.” It also instructed them to share their own RedNote accounts and encourage their followers to join them on the platform.\nXiaohongshu did not return a request for comment sent to its official WeChat account. Solare Global also did not respond to a request for comment asking how many influencers they contacted or how much the company expected to pay per post.\nThe brief viewed by WIRED required creators to turn their videos around on a 24-hour timeline to ensure they went up by January 17, the same day the Supreme Court was going to decide whether the TikTok ban would go into effect two days later. It also stipulated that influencers must leave their videos up for a minimum of six months.\nXiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and has long mostly focused on courting domestic audiences in China, particularly young women who live in major cities. Like TikTok, it revolves around a central algorithm that recommends users an endless stream of posts based on their interests and behavior. But instead of showing people one video at a time, Xiaohongshu presents photo slideshows, text posts, and videos in a grid format.\nBut perhaps the biggest difference between the two apps is how they handle content moderation. Because it's accessible in China, Xiaohongshu is required to adhere to strict censorship rules dictated by Beijing. (WIRED previously reported that Xiaohongshu was scrambling to hire English-speaking moderators to help manage the flood of content being posted by Americans.) TikTok, on the other hand, isn’t available in China. Its parent company, ByteDance, operates a separate video app there called Douyin.\nThe influx of Americans on Xiaohongshu provided a rare opportunity for people in the US and China to connect on a shared social media platform.

It now appears that Xiaohongshu is trying to capitalize on those sentiments to promote itself as a positive, global platform.\n“The warmth of normal people being kind and curious about one another is the core sentiment there at the moment,” the influencer brief said. “And we think it’s a beautiful thing.”",

It’s caused by skin-on-skin aggression or an item of clothing such as a pack, your running underwear or those old cotton socks rubbing away the top layer of your skin. Running creates a perfect recipe for chafing: friction, moisture and heat which all combined nastily with repetitive motion.\nWhere am I most likely to chafe?\nNipples: Stand at any marathon finish line and we guarantee you’ll see at least one runner crossing the line with big red blood patches radiating out in ripples on their technical t-shirt. Those runners have neglected their nipples and paid the price.\nThighs: Thighs tend to chafe more when skin is exposed but it can happen if your thighs touch while wearing loose-fitting or wet clothing, particularly cotton and non-sweat wicking fabric.\nUndercarriage: We’re politely referring here to the bits between your legs and the area extending up to and including your bottom. Whatever you’ve got down there, it’s at risk of serious rub and excruciating shower-sting.\nUnder arms: With all those sweat glands, armpits are highly prone to chafing. Even if you’ve applied the strongest antiperspirant, chances are, most of us will still sweat. When your arms start swinging, there’s a lot of damp skin-on-skin action.\nShoulders: Mainly one to worry about if you’re running with a backpack or hydration vest over longer distances or for longer hours, but this can be very painful.\nTips to prevent chafing\nWhy should you trust me on chafing? Well, I once ran the equivalent of 67 marathons in 67 days with a 25-pound backpack on. This is my toolkit for anyone trying to avoid pain.\nLube up: Anti-chafing products like petroleum jelly or specialized balms are your best anti-chafe defense. Even if your carefully selected fabrics let you down, generous coatings of lube can save the day. You can’t afford to be shy. Particularly downstairs. You want to make sure you’re getting into the places even you rarely go.\nGo seamless: I choose shorts, leggings, base layer shorts, tees and running underwear that are either seamless or have flat–lock seams. I always check the seams of the built-in twin shorts and I rarely trust the inner-briefs built into regular shorts. If in doubt, layer up with your own trusted undies.\nTighten up: I choose tighter, body hugging layers over loose fit gear. It sounds counterintuitive but fabric that stays in one place, close to the skin works better than loose-hanging fabrics that move around more.\nAvoid cotton: Cotton is heavy and can be abrasive even when it’s dry. When it gets wet with salty sweat, it’s a disaster for your soft bits. Those layers that touch your skin should be made from synthetic or wool-based fabrics. These dry faster and reduce friction.\nPowder your toes: Blisters are essentially chafing gone nuclear and they can be harder to avoid. Powdering my feet and socks can help reduce the moisture that increases the risk of rubbing and hotspots.",

    "content_text": "The night before president-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, right-wing influencers celebrated with cocktails, dancing, and McDonald’s cheeseburgers passed around on platters. They carried ring lights, posed with cardboard cutouts of Elon Musk wearing cowboy hats, and partied with Waka Flocka.\nThe event was sponsored by TikTok and called the Power 30 awards, to celebrate the right’s online cultural takeover. It took place at the Sax, a club decked out with plush velvet walls and garish gold decor located only a few blocks away from the White House.\nIn 2024, Trump and the Republicans won the election with TikTok collabs and podcast interviews. At this party and others across Washington, D,C on Sunday night, dozens of podcasters, influencers, and Republican digital strategists took their victory lap, boozing with their online mutuals and handing out awards for their accomplishments.\n“I wanted to recognize the people who paved the way for the president's return to the White House,” says CJ Pearson, cochair of the RNC’s youth advisory council and a host of Sunday’s event. “We won the influencer election in 2024. We won one of the most important battles, one of the longest-standing culture wars of our time.”\nThis party was for celebrating their victory—and preparing to continue their work under the incoming Trump administration.\nCreators and influencers were all over the 2024 election. They were at the Republican and Democratic conventions and the presidential and vice presidential debates. They streamed from fundraisers and rallies, and appeared on every social media app. They took to the airwaves too—content creators turned podcasters spent countless hours promoting candidates.\nWhile Democrats spent years building out their cohort of influencers, hosting them at campaign events and even President Joe Biden’s White House, the GOP did it better. Despite the Trump campaign’s steep fundraising disadvantages, it partnered with popular podcasters like the comedian Theo Von and Joe Rogan. The interviews were cost-effective and reached massive audiences, in the millions, within hours of their publication. Trump collaborated with OG vloggers turned professional fighters Jake and Logan Paul, along with Kick streamer Adin Ross and other creators, catering to the “manosphere.” During the presidential debates, similar faces—and others—stowed away in conference rooms that turned into makeshift influencer “war rooms.”\nFor years, conservative political influencers picked fights with platforms that would, they claimed, “unjustly” ban or fact-check them. But recently, with Elon Musk’s control of X and Mark Zuckerberg’s removal of fact-checking and many hate speech protections from Meta’s platforms, times have changed. These creators and influencers aren’t working on the fringes anymore, but have found a home right back on these platforms and in the mainstream.\nThroughout the inauguration weekend, Silicon Valley tech companies hosted a variety of creator-focused parties celebrating Trump’s White House takeover. Spotify held a special brunch for podcasters, including the Daily Wire’s Ben Shapiro. Google and YouTube are hosting their own reception for creators and podcasters, a source familiar told WIRED.\nAt the Power 30 party sponsored by TikTok, conservative content creators leaned into their newfound patrons, dancing to top 40 hits for hours in Make America Great Again hats with TikTok-labeled ear muffs stretched over them. At another TikTok-sponsored party at the Capital One Arena Saturday night, conservative creators received company merch, like a koozie with a graphic of Trump dancing or ear muffs in the company’s highlighter pink and blue colors. (Behind the scenes, TikTok appeared to be in turmoil. The app had gone offline Saturday night ahead of the presumptive ban, but returned Sunday and pushed a notification assuring its users that Trump would save the app once he took office.)\n“One of the best parts about my job is actually getting to spend time with our YouTube Creators, because they really do set the culture,” Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube, said in a statement following the company’s Sunday creator event. “They are experimenting with new ideas in the media landscape, and it was amazing to have a front row seat this past year.”\nAt Sunday’s influencer awards party, Trump campaign adviser Alex Bruesewitz, an architect of this winning influencer and online-focused strategy, received an award honoring his digital contributions. Years before joining Trump’s team, Bruesewitz ran X Strategies, a political media agency, working with young, online political candidates like Matt Gaetz. In 2022, he published Winning the Social Media War: How Conservatives Can Fight Back, Reclaim the Narrative, and Turn the Tides Against the Left, a book instructing Republicans on how to use social media for electoral gains.\n“Social media has created an entirely new battlefront for us,” Bruesewitz wrote in 2022. “We have to fight back, we will make them listen, and we will reopen the marketplace.”\nBruesewitz saw the potential podcasts had to bring Trump’s message to voters who weren’t already hearing it. The podcasts played a major role in Trump’s election, providing him with massive audiences of what Bruesewitz described as “medium- and low-propensity male voters” in an interview with WIRED after the election. It was these voters, who Bruesewitz said don’t usually consume mainstream media, that secured the win.\nOthers agreed: Shapiro told WIRED on Sunday that podcasts “gave a window into the authenticity of the candidates.”\nAnd according to Pearson, this year’s conservative influencer takeover is just the beginning.\nOver the summer, Pearson hosted an event with the Heritage Foundation to train more than two dozen conservative creators on how to communicate their politics with voters online. Savannah Chrisley, Sean Mike Kelly, and Emily Saves America, some of whom came out of the Turning Point USA ambassador program, attended the event.\nSince 2019, Turning Point has recruited and trained at least 400 conservative influencers in what is essentially an incubator. Some of the most popular influencers on the right have come out of Turning Point’s program, including Alex Clark, Benny Johnson, and Candace Owens. The training typically takes place at summits held around the country where Turning Point leadership, like Charlie Kirk and Tyler Bowyer, teach attendees how to post. Once an influencer is onboarded onto Turning Point’s influencer program, the organization’s public relations team actively pitches them to producers on networks like Fox News. They’re invited to special events where speakers (including Trump and Tucker Carlson) give speeches and allow for creators to network and collaborate to grow their audiences.\n“TPUSA has partnered with hundreds of dynamic personalities and content creators, from in-house contributors crafting content five days a week to influencers seamlessly integrating the message of freedom into their online presence and attending our premier events,” the organization’s website says.\n“We instituted our influencer program right after Trump got elected the first time,” Tyler Bowyer, the chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, told WIRED on Sunday. “The left has gotten lazy, depending on Hollywood for influence, while we've had homegrown influencers that come right here from Turning Point. The amount of reach we've received is in the billions, with people that people actually listen to while the left has relied on Hollywood.”\nGOP operatives are already planning new influencer training events to take place. “In the coming months we’ll be recruiting up-and-coming influencers, molding them, investing in them, and helping them grow their platforms,” says Pearson. “And this event also is a little bit of a kickoff to that, so we're super excited about it.”\nThe Biden White House invited influencers to events and special briefings, but the incoming Trump administration seems eager to incorporate them into its everyday media apparatus. At Pete Hegseth’s confirmation hearing for defense secretary, there were at least two conservative creators in the room. Graham Allen and Rob Smith, a pair of veterans and Turning Point USA influencers, sat in on the hearing, shooting video clips and writing tweets supporting Trump’s nominee and combating any criticism he received in real time online.\nWhen asked if the influencers were requested by the Trump team to attend and create content at Hegseth’s confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Trump adviser Jason Miller told WIRED, “Hegseth has many friends, former military colleagues, Gold Star families, and more who back his nomination, dozens of which are here to support him today!”\nOn Monday, a handful of the creators who bolstered Trump’s campaign online will attend the incoming president’s inaugural events. These moments will not only symbolize a new political era in the US, but a cultural one: one where people like Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, Von, and the Paul brothers have the ear of the president.\n\"We've won a really important battle in the culture war, but it's certainly not over. The war continues,” Matt Walsh, a conservative political commentator for the Daily Wire, told WIRED on Saturday.",

The podcasts played a major role in Trump’s election, providing him with massive audiences of what Bruesewitz described as “medium- and low-propensity male voters” <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-online-campaign-era/\">in an interview with WIRED after the election</a>. It was these voters, who Bruesewitz said don’t usually consume mainstream media, that secured the win.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Others agreed: Shapiro told WIRED on Sunday that podcasts “gave a window into the authenticity of the candidates.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">And according to Pearson, this year’s conservative influencer takeover is just the beginning.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Over the summer, Pearson hosted an event with the Heritage Foundation to train more than two dozen conservative creators on how to communicate their politics with voters online. Savannah Chrisley, Sean Mike Kelly, and Emily Saves America, some of whom came out of the Turning Point USA ambassador program, attended the event.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Since 2019, Turning Point has recruited and trained <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868483/turning-point-charlie-kirk-republican-influencers-instagram-today-is-america\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868483/turning-point-charlie-kirk-republican-influencers-instagram-today-is-america\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868483/turning-point-charlie-kirk-republican-influencers-instagram-today-is-america\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at least 400 conservative influencers</a> in what is essentially an incubator. Some of the most popular influencers on the right have come out of Turning Point’s program, including Alex Clark, Benny Johnson, and Candace Owens. The training typically takes place at summits held around the country where Turning Point leadership, like Charlie Kirk and Tyler Bowyer, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=779385522495806\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=779385522495806\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=779385522495806\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">teach attendees how to post</a>.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nWhen you decide it's time to give your kids access to your devices—or maybe even a phone or tablet of their own—you'll want to make sure they stay safe. There are dangers and risks out there in the digital world, just as there are in the physical one.\nGoogle, Apple, and Microsoft know this, and have built parental controls right into their various apps and platforms. These controls work by linking your account to the accounts of your kids, so you can put up the limits and safeguards you think are appropriate.\nGoogle's tools for managing your family and keeping your kids safe can be set up and accessed via the Your family on Google page on the web. From here you can connect to up to five other family members, and create Google accounts for any youngsters who are under 13.\nThat links your account with others and pools any Google One cloud storage you might have paid for. The next step is to download the Google Family Link app for Android or iOS—this is where you can monitor how your children are using their devices, and put limits on that usage if needed.\nThese features and controls only work if your kids are using Android devices or Chromebook laptops (though you can view and edit your settings from an iPhone or iPad). Neither Apple nor Google allow access to each other's parental control services, so you really need a family using the same operating systems.\nThe Google Family Link app can show you where in the world your family members are. Tap the menu button (three lines, top left), pick a name, then choose Location—this is handy for anything from making sure your youngsters are home from school to figuring out where you need to pick them up from.\nThen there's the parental controls section inside the app. Tap on the child account you want to manage, then Controls and Daily limit to set how much time your kid can spend on their devices overall. As well as a daily limit, you're also able to set a cut-off point via the Bedtime option, after which your youngster will find themselves locked out of their phones, tablets, and laptops until morning.\nDig into the Content restrictions section under Controls for each of your kids and you can block or allow specific apps to be run. (You'll also be able to approve new app downloads before they're installed, though app updates can be applied without your permission.) You can't limit time on specific apps, but you can see which apps your kids are using the most.\nFinally, via the Highlights tab inside the app you can manage the Android and ChromeOS devices your child has access to, and see what they're doing on those devices (in terms of the apps they're using and installing, for example). You can also manage the same set of options through the Your family on Google page on the web.\nApple\nApple's single stop for family account management is Family Sharing. Besides yourself, you can add up to five other people, kids or otherwise, and then share everything from Apple Music to purchased apps to iCloud storage. Children age 13 and over can have their own Apple ID. For younger children, you can create and manage an Apple ID for them.\nTo get started with Family Sharing, open Settings on an iPhone or iPad, tap your Apple account name at the top, then choose Family and Continue. If you're on a Mac, open up System Settings from the Apple menu, then click your name and Family > Set Up Family. Follow the instructions to invite people to your family or set up the necessary Apple accounts for your youngsters.\nWith your family created, services such as Apple TV Plus, Apple Music, Apple News Plus, and Apple Arcade are shared automatically if you're subscribed to them. Any iCloud storage you've purchased is pooled between family members, and Photos automatically creates a shared album for everyone to use. Most of this happens without any effort on your part—when people in your family sign into their Apple account, they'll see the same apps and services available as you do.\nIn terms of looking after your children, there are a few key tools bundled with Family Sharing. You can look up their locations on a map at any time—to do this, open up the Find My app on iOS or macOS and select the people you want to share your location with. You can also make sure that app, movie, music, and any other purchases your kids try to make go through you first. After selecting your Apple account in Settings on iOS or System Settings on macOS, choose Family then Purchase Sharing to set this up.\nYou can use the same Screen Time feature that tracks your own device usage to monitor what your kids are up to—and put limits in place if needed. Open up Screen Time from Settings on iOS or System Settings on macOS, and as long as you have a family sharing plan in place, you'll be able to select each of your children and see what they're up to, and put restrictions in place if needed.\nThere are six key categories to work through, though they're laid out slightly differently on mobile and on desktop: Downtime for controlling overall time on a device, App Limits for limiting time in specific apps, Communication Limits for controlling who your kids can chat with, Communication Safety for auto-detecting explicit content, Always Allowed for approving key apps for unlimited use, and Content & Privacy Restrictions for putting limits on accessing mature content—both in terms of videos and the web.\nYou can, for example, make sure only key apps like the Phone app are available after a certain time at night. Screen time works across Apple computers and mobile devices, so the settings are carried across, and of course you can adapt these settings at any time as your children get older.\nMicrosoft\nThe Microsoft account you use to sign in to Windows can form the basis of a family group that also allows you to keep tabs on your kids. These features work across Windows, Android, and Xbox, and to a limited extent on iOS (again, Apple doesn't really allow other software the necessary access to apps for phone monitoring).\nIn this case, there's a bit of a muddle of old and new tools. The best place to get started is the Microsoft Family Safety website. From there you'll be able to specify the people in your family (families can have up to six people in them, including you), and access the Microsoft Family Safety app on the web, Android, and iOS.\nAll the regular features for your family can be accessed through the apps on web and mobile. Pick one of your kids and you can see where they are on a map (based on the location of their Android device), see how much time they're spending on their devices, and put limits on screen time, app use, and web access.\nAs with Google and Apple, children aged 13 and over can have their own Microsoft accounts, and you can create accounts for kids that are younger than that. Apps and games on Windows and Xbox can be filtered by age appropriateness, while web and search limits can be set through the Microsoft Edge browser. Apps can be blocked on Windows, Xbox, or Android.\nTap the gear icon (top right) on any child profile on mobile to turn features like activity reporting, web filters, and app limits on or off. It gives you the flexibility you need to adjust these restrictions as your kids get older, and location sharing can also be toggled on or off from the same settings screen.\nChoose Screen time from the child profile to set how long they're allowed to spend on each device, and between which times. You can set app time limits on Windows, Xbox and Android, and overall screen time limits on Windows and Xbox. There are also tools on Windows and Xbox to keep children from buying new content or tons of in-app purchases. As long as your children are signing into their devices with their Microsoft accounts, the rules you've set will be applied.",

Every year brings new emoji—I like the “face with bags under eyes,” though that one is still rolling out. But there are times when the preinstalled options just aren't specific enough. Thankfully, Apple has a solution, and it's called Genmoji.\nWith the help of Apple Intelligence, you can generate custom emojis right from your keyboard using text prompts or even a person's photo from your Photos library. Below, I break down all the steps for creating your own Genmoji.\nCheck out our iOS 18 roundup for a full list of all the top features of Apple's latest operating system. Be sure to also look at our other Apple guides, including the Best iPhones, Best iPhone 16 Accessories, and Best iPads.\nEnable Apple Intelligence\nBefore we start, you'll want to check if you have access to Apple Intelligence. It launched with iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, but Genmoji specifically launched in iOS 18.2. To check your software version, go to Settings > General > About. You're good to go if it says iOS 18.2 or newer. If you need to update, back up your device first.\nIf you still don't have access to Genmoji, make sure that Apple Intelligence is enabled (it should be by default). Go to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri and toggle on Apple Intelligence. It's worth noting that Apple Intelligence is only available on select iPhones—the iPhone 16 range, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nEnter Your Prompt\n- When you have a Messages window open, tap on the emoji icon (the smiley face) or keyboard icon (the globe) to access the emoji keyboard.\n- In the upper right-hand corner of the keyboard, tap on the Genmoji icon (the pink and blue smiley face with a plus sign).\n- Type a few words or a phrase into the textbox that describes what you're looking for and tap Done.\n- Swipe through the populated Genmojis and tap Add on the one you want to use. It'll then appear in your drawer of emojis and stickers.\n- You can also create Genmojis based on images of people in your Photos app. Start by typing in a prompt like “Julian celebrating his birthday,” tap “Choose a Person” from the list of contacts that appear, and select the specific person. From there, you'll see various Genmojis populate based on the prompt. Tap Add when you've found the one you want to use.\nFine-Tune Your Genmoji\nYou can also tweak your original prompt to create new versions of your original Genmoji.\n- In the Genmoji window, tap on the text box.\n- Type in a refined version of your prompt or an entirely new version. For example, instead of “dog in a birthday hat,” you can change it to “dog with a birthday cake.” It will then automatically repopulate new versions.\nDelete a Genmoji\nYou can delete a Genmoji from your library if you no longer want it or want to create an updated version.\n- Open the emoji drawer on the Messages app and tap the emoji or keyboard icon.\n- Find the Genmoji you want to delete.\n- Long-press and tap Delete.\n- If you want to move it around your library, tap Rearrange and drag it wherever.\nJust remember, Genmoji is still in beta, so it may not always work smoothly and may make errors.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nI’ve tested basically every meal kit on the market over the past few years. And while there’s no denying the absolute convenience they offer, there are also a few tips and tricks I’ve learned to make the experience even smoother—namely, the gadgets and gizmos I reach for every single time a new box arrives at my door, full of ingredients to cook. From my favorite pan to the best oil to have around, consider these essentials if you’re cooking more at home. Of course, you probably already have a cutting board and a pan.

Subscribe Today.\nIs There Anything Else I Should Have on Hand?\nI go through a lot of paper towels when I’m making meal kits. I also highly recommend having a Rachael Ray–inspired “garbage bowl” on the counter for things like random plastic bits and aforementioned paper towels. (And a separate one for veggie scraps, if you compost.) Another thing worth noting is that you will likely use a lot of dishes when cooking meal kits. Start with your dishes done and your dishwasher empty for the best experience. And finally, I like to have a pair of scissors around for cutting open sauce packets or snipping green onions. I don’t think you really need specialty kitchen shears, but if you’ve got some, they’ll come in handy. Otherwise just grab whatever (clean!) pair you’ve got on hand.\nHow We Tested\nI’ve used every single item in this guide while cooking dozens, if not hundreds, of dishes, both for work and in my personal life. I’ve washed them, I’ve stored them, I’ve chopped on them, and I’ve recommended them to my friends. (Congrats, reader—we’re friends now.)",

    "content_text": "Less than 24 hours after going dark, TikTok says it has come back online after President-elect Donald Trump gave the company's service providers—presumably Apple, Google, and Oracle—reassurance that his administration wouldn’t enforce a law banning the app in the first place.\n\"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,” the company wrote in a statement. “We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"\nIt’s the latest salvo in the dramatic fight over TikTok’s future in the US. Last year, Congress passed a law that required ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, to divest its US operations or face a ban starting January 19. TikTok sued on First Amendment grounds but lost at the Supreme Court. Last night, Apple and Google took the app out of their respective app stores, as well as many other apps developed by ByteDance. Oracle reportedly told employees to shut down servers that hosted TikTok US data, according to The Information.\nThe move set the stage for President-elect Trump, who’d tried to ban TikTok when he was in office, to save the app before he is sworn in as President. “I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,” he wrote on Truth Social Sunday morning. “The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.”\nTechnically, the law only allows Trump to extend the enforcement deadline if ByteDance makes real progress on a deal to divest its US operations. Among those whose names have been mentioned as possible acquirers: Elon Musk and fellow billionaire Frank McCourt. While McCourt made an official bid, Musk’s name was reportedly floated in discussions with the Chinese government, according to Bloomberg. “I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up. Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.”\nTikTok, in addition to other ByteDance-owned apps, is still not back in US app stores as of publication. But several users have reported being able to access their timelines again after they were listed as unavailable last night. Others had regained access to their accounts, but with varying degrees of functionality.\nAfter the Supreme Court decision, the Biden administration appeared to walk back its commitment to the ban, saying that it was leaving enforcement up to the Trump administration. That reassurance was not enough for TikTok, which voluntarily took itself offline ahead of the deadline.\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appealed directly to Trump in a TikTok where he thanked the incoming president for his commitment to working with the company “to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.” On Blind, an anonymous messaging app that requires users to verify their employment before viewing company-specific posts, users mocked the video. “CEO begging Trump to save TT,” one wrote. “This is so cringe,” another responded.\nWhile many in Washington appeared to quietly stop supporting the ban, which had declined in popularity among US adults in recent months, others applauded the decision and voiced outrage when TikTok announced it was coming back online. “Any company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs. Think about it,” wrote Sen. Tom Cotton on X.",

    "content_text": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nA new proof has brought mathematicians one step closer to understanding the hidden order of those “atoms of arithmetic,” the prime numbers.\nThe primes—numbers that are only divisible by themselves and 1—are the most fundamental building blocks in math. They’re also the most mysterious. At first glance, they seem to be scattered at random across the number line. But of course, the primes aren’t random. They’re completely determined, and a closer look at them reveals all sorts of strange patterns, which mathematicians have spent centuries trying to unravel. A better understanding of how the primes are distributed would illuminate vast swaths of the mathematical universe.\nBut while mathematicians have formulas that give an approximate sense of where the primes are located, they can’t pinpoint them exactly. Instead, they’ve had to take a more indirect approach.\nAround 300 BCE, Euclid proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Mathematicians have since built on his theorem, proving the same statement for primes that meet additional criteria. (A simple example: Are there an infinite number of primes that don’t contain the number 7?) Over time, mathematicians have made these criteria stricter and stricter. By showing that there are still infinitely many primes that satisfy such increasingly rigid constraints, they’ve been able to learn more about where the primes live.\nBut these kinds of statements are very difficult to prove. “There are not many results like that out there,” said Joni Teräväinen of the University of Turku in Finland.\nNow, two mathematicians—Ben Green of the University of Oxford and Mehtaab Sawhney of Columbia University—have proved just such a statement for a particularly challenging type of prime number. Their proof, which was posted online in October, doesn’t just sharpen mathematicians’ understanding of the primes. It also makes use of a set of tools from a very different area of mathematics, suggesting that those tools are far more powerful than mathematicians imagined, and potentially ripe for applications elsewhere.\n“It’s terrific,” said John Friedlander of the University of Toronto. “It really surprised me that they did this.”\nA Trying Set\nMathematicians tend to study families of primes that are just complicated enough to be interesting but still simple enough to make progress on. They might try to prove, for instance, that there are infinitely many primes that are 500 units apart. Or that we can build infinitely many primes by adding up the squares of other numbers.\nThis last constraint has been particularly useful, guiding centuries of mathematical progress. In 1640, Pierre de Fermat conjectured that there are infinitely many primes that can be formulated by squaring two whole numbers and adding them together. (The prime number 13, for instance, can be written as 22 + 32.) Leonhard Euler later proved it. But tweaking the question just a little bit—by insisting that one of the numbers you’re squaring be odd, perhaps, or a perfect square—makes the problem much harder. “The more you constrain a set, the harder it is to find primes in it,” Green said.\nIn the 19th century, research on these kinds of statements led to the development of much of modern number theory. In the 20th century, it helped inspire one of the most ambitious mathematical efforts to date, the Langlands program. And in the 21st, work on these sorts of primes has continued to yield new techniques and insights.\nIn 2018, Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec of Rutgers University asked if there are infinitely many primes of the form p2 + 4q2, where both p and q must also be prime. (For example, 41 = 52 + 4 × 22.) The constraint turned out to be particularly challenging to deal with. But if mathematicians could solve the problem, they’d succeed in exerting a new level of control over the primes—exactly what they’d hoped to do all along.\nA Fruitful Visit\nNeither Green nor Sawhney had played this type of prime-counting game before. But they both had experience in studying the strange patterns the primes give rise to.\nIn July, the two mathematicians met at a conference in Edinburgh. Sawhney, who had just finished graduate school, had always admired Green. A seminal result Green had proved 20 years earlier was “one of the things that brought me into the subject,” Sawhney said. “I was like, ‘Oh man, how could you do this?’” Green was impressed by the younger mathematician, too. “Mehtaab is an exceptional, exceptional mathematician,” he said. “He knows everything somehow.”\nThe two decided to collaborate. They just had to find the right problem to work on. After some discussion, they settled on Friedlander and Iwaniec’s conjecture.\nGreen invited Sawhney to Oxford for a week. They knew that to prove similar conjectures, mathematicians usually relied on a particular suite of counting techniques. But because the primes in their problem were so strictly defined, Green and Sawhney couldn’t figure out a way to get this traditional tool kit to work.\nInstead, they hoped to prove the conjecture in a more roundabout way—by making a mathematical chess move of sorts. But first, they’d have to prove that they were allowed to make the move in the first place.\nBy the end of Sawhney’s visit, he and Green had figured out how to do that—which allowed them to prove the conjecture. To do so, they ended up making a surprising connection to another area of math.\nTry Another Set\nIt wasn’t possible for Green and Sawhney to directly count the number of primes made by squaring two other primes and adding them together. But what if they loosened their constraint just a bit? They realized they could solve a slightly weaker version of their problem—one where the numbers getting squared only had to be “roughly” prime.\nRough primes are much easier to find than primes. Say you want to count all the rough primes between 1 and 200. First, consider a handful of the smallest primes—like 2, 3, 5, and 7. Then list all the numbers that aren’t divisible by those primes. These numbers are the rough primes. In this case, you end up with 50 rough primes: 46 of them are actually prime, while the remaining four (121, 143, 169 and 187) are not. Because the rough primes are much less randomly distributed than the primes are, they’re significantly easier to work with. “The rough primes are a set that we understand much, much better,” Sawhney said.\nGreen and Sawhney proved that there are infinitely many primes that can be made by squaring two rough primes and adding them together. They now just had to show that this statement would imply the problem they actually wanted to solve: There are also infinitely many primes that can be written as the sum of squares of actual primes.\nBut that wasn’t obvious. They’d have to analyze a special set of functions, called Type I and Type II sums, for each version of their problem, then show that the sums were equivalent no matter which constraint they used. Only then would Green and Sawhney know they could substitute rough primes into their proof without losing information.\nThey soon came to a realization: They could show that the sums were equivalent using a tool that each of them had independently encountered in previous work. The tool, known as a Gowers norm, was developed decades earlier by the mathematician Timothy Gowers to measure how random or structured a function or set of numbers is. On its face, the Gowers norm seemed to belong to a completely different realm of mathematics. “It’s almost impossible to tell as an outsider that these things are related,” Sawhney said.\nBut using a landmark result proved in 2018 by the mathematicians Terence Tao and Tamar Ziegler, Green and Sawhney found a way to make the connection between Gowers norms and Type I and II sums. Essentially, they needed to use Gowers norms to show that their two sets of primes—the set built using rough primes, and the set built using real primes—were sufficiently similar.\nAs it turned out, Sawhney knew how to do this. Earlier this year, in order to solve an unrelated problem, he had developed a technique for comparing sets using Gowers norms. To his surprise, the technique was just good enough to show that the two sets had the same Type I and II sums.\nWith this in hand, Green and Sawhney proved Friedlander and Iwaniec’s conjecture: There are infinitely many primes that can be written as p2 + 4q2. Ultimately, they were able to extend their result to prove that there are infinitely many primes belonging to other kinds of families as well. The result marks a significant breakthrough on a type of problem where progress is usually very rare.\nEven more important, the work demonstrates that the Gowers norm can act as a powerful tool in a new domain. “Because it’s so new, at least in this part of number theory, there is potential to do a bunch of other things with it,” Friedlander said. Mathematicians now hope to broaden the scope of the Gowers norm even further—to try using it to solve other problems in number theory beyond counting primes.\n“It’s a lot of fun for me to see things I thought about some time ago have unexpected new applications,” Ziegler said. “It’s like as a parent, when you set your kid free and they grow up and do mysterious, unexpected things.”\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

Video-editing app CapCut, photo- and video-sharing app Lemon8, and others have now gone dark in the US.\nA federal law passed last year bans ByteDance-owned apps from operating in the US on national security grounds. In reaction to Chinese laws that demand China-based companies provide their data to the Chinese government and intelligence agencies, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) required ByteDance to sell TikTok and its other apps to an entity not based in China by Sunday.\nThat sale did not happen. As a result, TikTok began blocking US-based users on Saturday, January 18, ahead of the midnight deadline. Because PAFACA bans all apps operated by ByteDance, not just TikTok, users of its myriad other apps are meeting the same restrictions.\nPAFACA does not require ByteDance to block US-based users of its apps. Instead, it prohibits any US company from providing any service to “distribute, maintain or update” ByteDance-owned apps. As a result, many of these apps are no longer available in Apple and Google’s app stores. That may change soon after Donald Trump takes office on Monday, however, with the US president-elect indicating that he plans to extend the deadline for a sale of TikTok by 90 days. Yes, it is all very confusing.\nFor now, here’s the rundown of all the apps US users can no longer access due to the US ban on ByteDance-owned apps.\nTikTok, TikTok Studio, TikTok Shop Seller, TikTok Lite\nNot just TikTok, but other ByteDance-owned apps that work for the TikTok ecosystem have also become unavailable along with the main app. These include TikTok Studio (for creators to manage content and check analytics), TikTok Shop Seller (for ecommerce sellers on the app to manage their business operations), and TikTok Lite (a smaller and faster version of the original app that’s only available in certain countries).\nCapCut\nCapCut is a free video-editing tool, optimized for vertical videos that can be posted on TikTok. It is often the app of choice for amateur creators, due to its professional features. Some creators also use CapCut to first produce videos before uploading them to platforms other than TikTok.\nLemon8\nByteDance released Lemon8 in February 2023 as a photo-based social media app. It is known for resembling RedNote, a particularly successful social media app in China that has also become the destination for many TikTok users in exile this week. Some TikTok users had also chosen to migrate to Lemon8, but the app has also gone offline.\nGauth\nWith Gauth, students can take pictures of their homework, and the app will use artificial intelligence to understand the problem and provide step-by-step solutions. It also has other features that help students be more productive while studying. According to the app’s shutdown announcement this weekend, it has “helped 300 million users with billions of questions.”\nMarvel Snap, Land of Empires, Mission EVO\nAlso swept up in the ban on ByteDance-owned apps are several games, including the fast-action card game Marvel Snap. Developed by California-based studio Second Dinner, Marvel Snap is published by Nuverse, which ByteDance owns and launched in 2019. Second Dinner said in a statement posted to X that it did not expect to be part of the collateral damage of the TikTok ban law and vowed to restore access for US users. “Marvel Snap isn’t going anywhere. We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share,” the company said.\nNuverse games Land of Empires and Mission EVO are also no longer available in US app stores.\nHypic\nHypic, launched in 2022, is a photo-editing tool with a heavy focus on generative AI tools. It uses AI to help users enhance photo quality or transform a photo into a cartoon.\nLark\nLark is a Slack-like workspace communications app. Originally created for ByteDance’s own internal messages among employees, it has now become one of the most-used office communications apps in China, with several million active users.\nMelolo, Fizzo, MyTopia Books\nPoligon, a Singapore-based subsidiary of ByteDance, publishes several apps that allow users to watch short vertical dramas (Melolo) or read online fiction novels (Fizzo and MyTopia Books). MyTopia Books is the only one of those apps that did not end support for US-based users, and somehow remains available on Apple’s US App Store.\nTokopedia\nTokopedia is one of Indonesia’s largest ecommerce platforms. It was acquired by ByteDance in December 2023 and merged with TikTok Shop’s operation in the country after the Indonesian government banned the latter app, citing “the need to protect smaller merchants and users’ data.”\nIt has become unavailable on Apple’s US App Store but remains available on Google’s US Play Store as of publication.\nUpdated 9 am EST, January 19, 2025: Added the games Marvel Snap, Land of Empires, and Mission EVO to the list of apps unavailable in the US as a result of the ban on ByteDance-owned properties.",

    "content_text": "After an opaque and uncertain saga, TikTok went dark on millions of phones across the United States on Saturday evening around 10:30 pm EST. Google Play and Apple’s App Store both pulled the app late Saturday as well. If it was already installed prior to Saturday evening, the app is still there on your phone, but launching it only reveals a pop-up warning about the ban. As the deadline loomed, TikTok users had been bracing for the change and flooding other platforms, including the Chinese social app Xiaohongshu or “RedNote.” But if you’re not quite ready to give up the latest skin-care hacks, budgeting tips, and pet tortoise influencers, there are some options for circumventing the ban and continuing to use the platform.\n“Sorry, TikTok isn’t available right now,” the app alert reads. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!” Other ByteDance-owned apps, including CapCut and Lemon8, also disappeared from US app stores.\nSuch a ban has never existed in the US before, so the technical methods being employed to implement it are still evolving, and circumvention techniques may need to change as well. The law driving the situation, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), doesn’t make it illegal to have TikTok on your phone. And, notably, it also doesn’t say that TikTok itself has to stop the app from working in the US.\nNonetheless, the company said in the days before the law took effect that it planned to make the app inaccessible to US users—a level of cooperation and accommodation that the outgoing Biden White House called a “stunt” on Saturday afternoon. Even if TikTok itself had obligations under the law, the Biden White House had signaled that it did not plan to enforce the ban before Trump took office on Monday.\nRather than putting the pressure on TikTok, PAFACA requires app stores and cloud hosting services to stop doing anything to “distribute, maintain or update” TikTok. That puts the pressure on Apple and Google to stop new users from downloading TikTok, as well as infrastructure providers like Oracle to keep new content or software updates from reaching the app’s users. Over time, TikTok would likely degrade and become unusable.\nOfficials in India banned TikTok in 2020, and the company also proactively blacked out the app in that case. When Indian users who already had the app installed tried to launch it, a pop-up appeared telling them that they couldn’t access the service.\nDevashish Gosain, a network analysis researcher and assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, says that in India, TikTok users must remove their Indian SIM card from their phone or use an international SIM card and then run a VPN in order to load content in the app.\n“Even VPNs do not lead to circumvention” in India, Gosain told WIRED.\nIn the early hours of the US ban, it was unclear exactly how feasible it would be to get around the restrictions for US accounts. It seemed that TikTok had taken a more extreme approach, turning any US builds of the app dark—blacking out versions of the TikTok app software that had been made to be downloaded and used by US users. It also seemed that US-linked accounts were being blocked regardless of IP address or SIM country information.\nRunning a VPN alone was certainly not enough to circumvent the ban and get back on TikTok. But seemingly using a non-US TikTok account after removing a SIM (or on a device without a US SIM card/US phone number) worked when combined with a VPN. Similarly, using a VPN with a desktop browser or the Tor Browser was enough to get a non-US TikTok account to load in the US early on Sunday morning, though TikTok’s desktop version has always been much more limited than its mobile app.\nThe impact of the ban has been immediate, with internet traffic data from monitoring firm Kentik showing an instant and dramatic drop off in connections to TikTok. On other social media platforms, people are complaining that TikTok is not working on their US-linked devices or accounts even though they are abroad.\nTikTok’s privacy policies, which are not unlike those of other social media apps, describe a range of information it collects, which could be used to identify people’s home locations. This includes everything from address information users provide to device system settings, SIM card regions, and other network information. (TikTok’s privacy policy now includes a note saying service to US users may not be available due to the law, calling it an “interruption.”)\nIn a statement posted online, Apple says if US users delete TikTok or move to a new phone, TikTok and other ByteDance apps can’t be reinstalled. It also stated that the software distribution ban will impact people visiting the US. “Users visiting from outside the United States with their Apple Account set to a country or region that is not the United States are unable to download, update, or make in-app purchases and new subscriptions,” Apple says.\n“TikTok inspects the source IP of the network packets—if the source IP belongs to India, it drops the packets,” Gosain explains, of the restrictions in India. “Also, the TikTok app fetches the country information embedded in the SIM card, and if the country code is ‘IN,’ it filters the network connection. When we remove the SIM card, the TikTok app fails to identify Indian users from the SIM card, and when we use VPNs, the IP address changes, and it no longer belongs to the Indian IP range. Thus, TikTok again fails to identify that the user is accessing from India. This is how we bypass the filtering.”\nVirtual private networks, or VPNs, work by passing your internet traffic through servers that are physically maintained in locations around the world, so you can select an IP address that is tied to a different location than where you physically are. For example, American TikTok users can use VPNs to make it look like they are accessing the internet from outside the US. VPNs also stop your internet service provider (ISPs) from seeing your browsing data, adding an extra potential layer of privacy. When you’re using a VPN, your ISP will simply see connections to the VPN instead of having access to the detailed list of all the websites you’re visiting.\nAs a result of these capabilities, VPNs are frequently used in attempts to get around digital geolocation restrictions, like those on Netflix or other streaming platforms. They’re also an important, and familiar, tool for circumventing internet censorship programs for people living under authoritarian regimes like those in Russia, China, and Iran.\nUsing a VPN comes with caveats, though. Some commercial VPNs log people’s browsing history, which essentially just shifts data collection from ISPs to VPN makers. This means that the data isn’t more protected, and that law enforcement could request it from a VPN provider in the same way that they make requests to ISPs. As a result, picking a free VPN is generally not a good idea—with some even selling access to your home internet connections. But some VPNs publish no-logging policies and offer third-party audits and other transparency features in an attempt to show their compliance.\nFor now, it seems that TikTok’s efforts to block US users are extremely draconian, and even a non-US SIM card or no SIM card plus a VPN may not be a workable path to getting back on the app with a US TikTok account. But the restrictions may only be temporary anyway. In practice, there seems to be little appetite for a permanent ban in the US. And, in spite of originating the idea, President Trump has said in recent days that he doesn’t want the app to be banned.\n“My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Friday. “Stay tuned!”\nUpdated 8:42 am EST, January 19, 2025: Added details about traffic analytics to TikTok, the company's privacy policy related to location, and a statement from Apple.",

    "content_text": "For the first time in internet history, the United States government has officially banned a major global social media platform, joining the ranks of authoritarian regimes like Russia and China. On Saturday, TikTok officially went dark. Users who attempt to access the app are now greeted with a message that says “TikTok isn’t available right now.”\n“We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office,” the message adds. “Please stay tuned!”\nIt’s the final outcome of legislation Congress passed last year that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to either sell the app’s American operations or face a nationwide ban. But unlike countries that regularly engage in internet censorship, the US does not have centralized infrastructure to prevent Americans from accessing specific apps or websites.\nInstead, the law puts pressure on Apple and Google to delete TikTok from their app stores, or risk accumulating millions of dollars in fines. Both companies appeared to have removed TikTok and other apps owned by its parent company, ByteDance, as of Saturday. Google and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe law also bans companies from providing data hosting services to TikTok. Oracle, which counts TikTok as one of its largest cloud computing customers, reportedly began telling staff to shut down servers that host US TikTok data on Saturday, according to The Information. Oracle did not immediately return a request for comment.\nIn May, TikTok and a group of US creators appealed to stop the law from going into effect, saying it violated the First Amendment. The Supreme Court rejected those arguments in a unanimous ruling on January 17, concluding that the provision was motivated by “well-supported national security concerns.”\n“It’s a blatant violation of the First Amendment,” says Evelyn Douek, a professor at Stanford Law School who specializes in online speech issues. “Unfortunately for me, all nine of the Supreme Court justices disagree, and pretty much everyone that matters is going to listen to their opinion over mine. It's hard to take the national security justification seriously, though, when in recent days presidents past and future as well as members of Congress seem to be backpedaling on whether an immediate shutdown is necessary after all.”\nWith days to go until the deadline, President Biden signaled that he’d leave enforcement of the law up to the incoming Trump administration. The move left the app’s fate in limbo, and TikTok urged the Biden administration Saturday to provide definitive assurance that it wouldn’t enforce the law. In response, Biden’s team suggested TikTok raise its concerns with Trump.\nOn Blind, an anonymous messaging app popular with tech workers, some TikTok employees spiraled about whether they’d have jobs next month, while others went about business as usual. “Anyone else’s manager still scheduling meetings next week about new, upcoming projects without acknowledging the ban whatsoever?” wrote one user. “I have 2025 strategy meetings next week,” another user responded. “I am just doing what I’m told. It’s comforting in a way.”\nTrump tried to ban TikTok during his first term, but he later changed his stance after amassing a large following on the platform. The incoming president said on Saturday that he “likely” would issue an executive order on Monday giving TikTok a 90-day extension on the ban. “I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at,” he said in an interview with NBC News.\nBut the law itself technically limits Trump's ability to temporarily halt the ban. It permits the president to grant a 90-day extension only if there is evidence that “significant progress” has been made toward a sale, including “binding legal agreements” between the parties.\nA colorful assortment of tech and business figures have said they are interested in acquiring TikTok, including real estate mogul and former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers Frank McCourt. Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence search engine startup, filed a bid to create a new merged entity with TikTok on Saturday, according to CNBC.\nAnother idea that was reportedly discussed among officials in the Chinese government is selling TikTok’s US operations to Elon Musk, who would combine them with his existing social media platform X, according to Bloomberg. TikTok called the report “pure fiction” in a statement to Variety. On Friday, Trump said that he had a “very good” call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about TikTok and other policy issues.\nGetting rid of TikTok was not a particularly popular policy among the American public. Thirty-two percent of US adults said they supported the government banning the app in 2024, down from fifty percent in 2023, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Thirty-nine percent said they weren’t sure about the idea.\nTikTok users spent the week flooding the platform with videos expressing their outrage and despair over the looming threat of an imminent ban. One song with bitterly sarcastic lyrics mocking the US government’s misplaced priorities became their rallying cry: “If you’re asking me, the biggest problem is TikTok It’s not global warming, not access to healthcare—welfare, boring! Corruption at the top, citizens getting shot, With all that’s going on, now’s the perfect time for banning TikTok.”\nHundreds of thousands of US TikTok users also flocked to another Chinese-owned platform, RedNote, in a defiant move meant to show just how little they cared about the national security concerns lawmakers said motivated their decision to ban TikTok. “I don’t fucking care that China has my data, are you joking?” TikTok creator Imani Barbarin said in a video that received nearly 1 million likes. “Everybody has my data.”",

Learn more.\nEarlier this month, Native unveiled a Dunkin’-themed personal care line: a sugary spread of body washes, deodorants, lotions, shampoos, and conditioners in the familiar (to some) scents of Vanilla Sprinkle, Strawberry Frosted, Blueberry Cobbler, and Boston Kreme. Social media, as always, was split. Half of the internet rushed to snag a bottle (or five), while the other half dunked on the idea of smelling like Ben Affleck’s breakfast order.\nThis isn’t Native’s first bite at the food collab apple. Its partnership with Mexican soda juggernaut Jarritos—still available for purchase—turned nostalgic soft drinks into skin-friendly suds. Dove, not to be outdone, teamed up with Crumbl Cookies to launch a limited-edition lineup of soaps, scrubs, and deodorants in Strawberry Crumb Cake, Lemon Glaze, and Confetti Cake. Dove even swapped its signature white packaging for Crumbl’s bubblegum pink, a first for the brand.\nIt’s absurd. It’s viral. And it’s working. The food-beauty crossover is suddenly everywhere. It is the allure of nostalgia, the pull of meme culture, and the sticky-sweet scent of capitalism wafting through the air. Most importantly, we are eating it up.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year.

As early as 1975, Lip Smacker debuted its first flavor collaboration with Dr. Pepper, transforming lip balm into a collectible. The trend—what we now call “gourmand” scents, which is to say, synthetic scents that smell like delicious food—was popularized by Thierry Mugler's iconic Angel perfume, which has been described as getting hit in the face with a ball of cotton candy.\nBy the early 2000s, the trend had trickled down as tweens hoarded Lip Smackers in flavors like Fanta and Skittles, while Bath & Body Works Cucumber Melon body spray ruled girls’ locker rooms (if you know, you know). In the 2010s, brands like Too Faced leaned into the aesthetic with palettes shaped like chocolate bars. Even Dunkin’—back when it was still calling itself Dunkin’ Donuts—dipped its toes into the trend in 2019 with a nail polish line.\nBut in 2023, we moved from food-inspired aesthetics to actually wanting to look like food, with trends like cinnamon cookie butter hair, blueberry milk nails, and glazed doughnut skin. Today, anything goes: Velveeta hair dye, dill-pickle-flavored lube, and Hellman’s parfum de mayonnaise—the rule seems to be the more unhinged, the better.\nFor millennials and zillennials, these products are a sensory trip down memory lane, reviving the candy-scented mall staples of our youth. For Gen Z, it’s a clash of high and low—a clean beauty brand like Native rubbing shoulders with a fast food institution like Dunkin’.\nSo Happy Together\nTikTok, with its algorithmic obsession with the absurd, thrives on these edible beauty launches. The marketing strategy borrows liberally from streetwear’s scarcity playbook, implementing limited-edition drops designed to create urgency and exclusivity. But unfortunately, these products aren’t built to last. They’re flashpoints for FOMO-prone shoppers and sentimentalists looking to romanticize their routines. For Gen Z, the more bizarre the concept, the faster it seems to circulate.\nFood and beverage (F&B) licensing is a lucrative avenue for these partnerships. According to Licensing International’s 2023 Global Licensing Industry Study, F&B grew by 5.3 percent, and the cosmetic industry is dipping its manicured fingers into the pie. Everyone benefits from these symbiotic relationships, as food franchises use the shareability of #BeautyTok to sprinkle their branding into new markets.\nThe result is a syrupy cocktail of millennial nostalgia and Gen Z irony that generates free advertising via memes, TikTok reactions, and social media discourse.\nSo, what’s next? Crunchwrap-scented cologne? Hot Cheetos-flavored toothpaste? Perhaps a McRib collagen serum? As brands push the boundaries of absurdity, the question isn’t whether they’ll go too far, it’s when we hit our breaking point. Novelty has a shelf life.\nWithout meaningful innovation, the joke risks wearing thin, much like some of these franchises themselves. In the meantime, though, there’s a cautionary tale: The punch line here is the consumer, not the product. We don't want to wake up tomorrow smelling like Cheetos and pickles and realize that the joke’s on us.",

    "content_text": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\nFirefighters battling the deadly wildfires that raced through the Los Angeles area in January 2025 have been hampered by a limited supply of fresh water. So, when the winds are calm enough, skilled pilots flying planes aptly named Super Scoopers are skimming off 1,500 gallons of sea water at a time and dumping it with high precision on the fires.\nUsing seawater to fight fires can sound like a simple solution—the Pacific Ocean has a seemingly endless supply of water. In emergencies like Southern California is facing, it’s often the only quick solution, though the operation can be risky amid ocean swells.\nBut seawater also has downsides.\nSalt water corrodes firefighting equipment and may harm ecosystems, especially those like the chaparral shrublands around Los Angeles that aren’t normally exposed to seawater. Gardeners know that small amounts of salt—added, say, as fertilizer—does not harm plants, but excessive salts can stress and kill plants.\nWhile the consequences of adding seawater to ecosystems are not yet well understood, we can gain insights on what to expect by considering the effects of sea level rise.\nA Seawater Experiment in a Coastal Forest\nAs an ecosystem ecologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, I lead a novel experiment called TEMPEST that was designed to understand how and why historically salt-free coastal forests react to their first exposures to salty water.\nSea-level rise has increased by an average of about 8 inches globally over the past century, and that water has pushed salty water into US forests, farms, and neighborhoods that had previously known only fresh water. As the rate of sea level rise accelerates, storms push seawater ever farther onto the dry land, eventually killing trees and creating ghost forests, a result of climate change that is widespread in the US and globally.\nIn our TEMPEST test plots, we pump salty water from the nearby Chesapeake Bay into tanks, then sprinkle it on the forest soil surface fast enough to saturate the soil for about 10 hours at a time. This simulates a surge of salty water during a big storm.\nOur coastal forest showed little effect from the first 10-hour exposure to salty water in June 2022 and grew normally for the rest of the year. We increased the exposure to 20 hours in June 2023, and the forest still appeared mostly unfazed, although the tulip poplar trees were drawing water from the soil more slowly, which may be an early warning signal.\nThings changed after a 30-hour exposure in June 2024. The leaves of tulip poplar in the forests started to brown in mid-August, several weeks earlier than normal. By mid-September the forest canopy was bare, as if winter had set in. These changes did not occur in a nearby plot that we treated the same way, but with fresh water rather than seawater.\nThe initial resilience of our forest can be explained in part by the relatively low amount of salt in the water in this estuary, where water from freshwater rivers and a salty ocean mix. Rain that fell after the experiments in 2022 and 2023 washed salts out of the soil.\nBut a major drought followed the 2024 experiment, so salts lingered in the soil then. The trees’ longer exposure to salty soils after our 2024 experiment may have exceeded their ability to tolerate these conditions.\nSeawater being dumped on the Southern California fires is full-strength, salty ocean water. And conditions there have been very dry, particularly compared with our East Coast forest plot.\nChanges Evident in the Ground\nOur research group is still trying to understand all the factors that limit the forest’s tolerance to salty water, and how our results apply to other ecosystems such as those in the Los Angeles area.\nTree leaves turning from green to brown well before fall was a surprise, but there were other surprises hidden in the soil below our feet.\nRainwater percolating through the soil is normally clear, but about a month after the first and only 10-hour exposure to salty water in 2022, the soil water turned brown and stayed that way for two years. The brown color comes from carbon-based compounds leached from dead plant material. It’s a process similar to making tea.\nOur lab experiments suggest that salt was causing clay and other particles to disperse and move about in the soil. Such changes in soil chemistry and structure can persist for many years.\nSea-Level Rise Is Increasing Coastal Exposure\nWhile ocean water can help fight fires, there are reasons fire officials prefer freshwater sources—provided fresh water is available.\nUS coastlines, meanwhile, are facing more extensive and frequent saltwater exposure as rising global temperatures accelerate sea level rise that drowns forests, fields, and farms, with unknown risks for coastal landscapes.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIf you've got yourself a Kindle for e-book reading—maybe a brand-new model like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition or Kindle Colorsoft—then you'll know these devices are brilliantly simple in terms of their interfaces and controls. The focus is on the text and whatever you happen to be reading.\nBehind the simple and friendly interface though, the Kindle has more features and tricks than you might expect. Sure, these e-readers aren't going to compete with iPads for functionality, but there's a lot you can do with them—from customizing the reading experience to getting content other than ebooks onto the screen.\n1. Look Up Words\nDon't be flummoxed by unfamiliar words you come across while reading. You can get definitions for anything onscreen just by pressing and holding on the word. When the definition appears, you can swipe to the left to see if there's a Wikipedia entry for the word, and swipe left again to have the word translated into another language.\n2. Send Web Articles to Your Kindle\nYou can also use your Kindle to catch up on your online reading, by sending web articles to the device. Perhaps the easiest option is the official Kindle extension for Google Chrome—as long as you only want to send articles from a desktop web browser. Once you're signed into your Amazon account, article transfers only take a few clicks.\nThe Kindle extension is quick and free, but it doesn't always get web page formatting right, and it doesn't work on mobile. Instapaper does a better job with its own Kindle-sync service, but you need the $6-per-month premium plan to access it. Push to Kindle is good too, but a $3-per-month subscription is required to send more than 10 articles per month.\n3. Take a Screenshot\nYou can take screenshots on a Kindle, if you want to show off your library or share a passage from a book on social media, for example. Just tap two diagonally opposite corners, right in the corner. The screen flashes, and the screengrab is saved. Connect your Kindle up to a computer with a USB cable, and you'll find all your screenshots saved in their own dedicated folder.\n4. Sort Your Ebooks Into Collections\nAs you add more and more ebooks (and web articles) to your library, it can start to get a bit unwieldy—and sorting through it to find your next read becomes more difficult. You can mitigate this to some extent by creating collections. These are essentially folders to sort titles into, whether it's by genre, by author, or how soon you want to read them.\nTo get started, from the Kindle’s homepage tap the three dots in the top right, then Create a Collection. Give your collection a name, and mark it as a favorite if you want (which makes it appear more prominently across various screens). You can then opt to sort the Library page by collections—just tap the sort-by icon, the three horizontal lines in the top right.\n5. See Book Covers More Often\nIf you miss the old experience of seeing the cover every time you close your paper book, you can get the digital equivalent by setting the cover of the ebook you're currently reading as the Kindle screensaver. From the home screen, tap the three dots (top right), then choose Settings > Screen and brightness and enable the Show covers on lock screen option.\n6. Change the Screen Warmth\nIf you have a Kindle Paperwhite, Oasis, or Colorsoft, you can access a warmth setting for the screen—this changes the tint of the display, so your eyes don't have to strain so much when reading text. To find the relevant settings from the homepage, tap the three dots (top right), then Settings > Screen and brightness > Brightness and warmth.\nThis can be especially useful late at night, when you might be reading in the dark, but you can use it anytime and in any scenario you like. Adjust the Warmth slider as needed, and turn on the Warmth schedule toggle switch to get the display to adjust automatically based on the time of day. You can set start and end times, and a level of warmth.\n7. Check Your Progress\nTap down in the bottom-left corner of the screen to change how your progress through the current ebook is indicated. You can see your current page number (based on font size and page settings), your current reading location as a fixed number, the reading time remaining in the current chapter, and the reading time remaining for the whole ebook. These times get adjusted dynamically as your Kindle tracks how quickly you’re progressing through each book.\n8. Install the Other Kindle Apps\nBesides using the Kindle device, you can also install Kindle apps for Android and iOS, as well as Windows and macOS. There's even a web app for reading in the browser. While the reading experience on these other screens isn't quite as good as it is on a dedicated e-reader, as long as you use the same Amazon account, all of your reading across all of these devices will be synced up.\nThat means you can grab five minutes of reading time on the bus on your phone, even if you don't have your actual Kindle; or you can get through a few pages between meetings on your laptop. When you pick up your e-reader again, you'll find your reading position updated, and it's a simple trick for getting through your list of ebooks more quickly.\n9. Get a Text Style You’re Comfortable With\nTap near the top of the page when reading a book, then tap the Aa icon, and you can access a range of options to get the text onscreen looking exactly the way you want. You're able to adjust the spacing between lines, the alignment of paragraphs, the style and size of the main font, and even the size of the page margins.",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><figure class=\"CneAudioEmbedFigure-bWHoMv hIHLrt\" data-testid=\"cne-audio-embed-figure\"></figure><p class=\"paywall\"><span class=\"lead-in-text-callout\">If you've got</span> yourself a Kindle for e-book reading—maybe a brand-new model like the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-2024/\">Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/kindle-colorsoft/\">Kindle Colorsoft</a>—then you'll know these devices are brilliantly simple in terms of their interfaces and controls. The focus is on the text and whatever you happen to be reading.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Behind the simple and friendly interface though, the Kindle has more features and tricks than you might expect. Sure, these e-readers aren't going to compete with iPads for functionality, but there's a lot you can do with them—from customizing the reading experience to getting content other than ebooks onto the screen.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class=\"paywall\">1. Look Up Words</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Don't be flummoxed by unfamiliar words you come across while reading. You can get definitions for anything onscreen just by pressing and holding on the word. When the definition appears, you can swipe to the left to see if there's a Wikipedia entry for the word, and swipe left again to have the word translated into another language.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">2. Send Web Articles to Your Kindle</h2><p class=\"paywall\">You can also use your Kindle to catch up on your online reading, by sending web articles to the device. Perhaps the easiest option is <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/chrome\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/chrome\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/chrome\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the official Kindle extension</a> for Google Chrome—as long as you only want to send articles from a desktop web browser. Once you're signed into your Amazon account, article transfers only take a few clicks.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">The Kindle extension is quick and free, but it doesn't always get web page formatting right, and it doesn't work on mobile. <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.instapaper.com/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.instapaper.com/\" href=\"https://www.instapaper.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instapaper</a> does a better job with its own Kindle-sync service, but you need the $6-per-month premium plan to access it. <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.pushtokindle.com/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.pushtokindle.com/\" href=\"https://www.pushtokindle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Push to Kindle</a> is good too, but a $3-per-month subscription is required to send more than 10 articles per month.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>Use the Kindle Chrome extension to send articles to your e-reader.</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">David Nield</span></div></figure><h2 class=\"paywall\">3. Take a Screenshot</h2><p class=\"paywall\">You can take screenshots on a Kindle, if you want to show off your library or share a passage from a book on social media, for example. Just tap two diagonally opposite corners, right in the corner. The screen flashes, and the screengrab is saved. Connect your Kindle up to a computer with a USB cable, and you'll find all your screenshots saved in their own dedicated folder.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">4. Sort Your Ebooks Into Collections</h2><p class=\"paywall\">As you add more and more ebooks (and web articles) to your library, it can start to get a bit unwieldy—and sorting through it to find your next read becomes more difficult. You can mitigate this to some extent by creating collections. These are essentially folders to sort titles into, whether it's by genre, by author, or how soon you want to read them.</p><p class=\"paywall\">To get started, from the Kindle’s homepage tap the three dots in the top right, then <strong>Create a Collection</strong>. Give your collection a name, and mark it as a favorite if you want (which makes it appear more prominently across various screens). You can then opt to sort the Library page by collections—just tap the sort-by icon, the three horizontal lines in the top right.</p></div></div></body></html>",

Essential oils have been promoted as “immune support” for people trying to prevent Covid, and a huge body of evidence-less products have sprung up for people who want to “detox” from the effects of Covid vaccines or being near people who have been vaccinated. (Vaccine detox was promoted by some in the alt-wellness world even before Covid.)\n“Wellness influencers are always leveraging tragedies,” DeMille points out, “but typically they’re personal tragedies”—say, telling sick people to try their products while undergoing cancer treatments or chronic illness.\n“Leveraging a community tragedy isn’t that long of a walk,” she adds.\nAs climate disasters continue to happen more frequently—and the world faces a new potential pandemic in the form of bird flu—business looks extremely good for wellness influencers adept at turning disease and disasters into marketing hooks.",

    "content_text": "As the Biden administration comes to a close, the White House released a 40-page executive order on Thursday aimed at shoring up federal cybersecurity protections and placing guardrails on the US government’s use of AI. WIRED also spoke with outgoing US ambassador for cyberspace and digital policy, Nathaniel Fick, about the urgency that the Trump administration not cow to Russia and China in the global race for technical dominance. Outgoing FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel details to WIRED the threats facing US telecoms, at least nine of which were recently breached by China’s Salt Typhoon hackers. Meanwhile, US officials are still scrambling to get a handle on multiple espionage campaigns and other data breaches, with new revelations this week that a breach of AT&T disclosed last summer compromised FBI call and text logs that could reveal the identity of anonymous sources.\nHuione Guarantee, the massive online marketplace that researchers say provides an array of services to online scammers, is expanding its offerings to include a messaging app, stablecoin, and crypto exchange and has facilitated a whopping $24 billion in transactions, according to new research. New findings indicate that GitHub’s efforts to crack down on the use of deepfake porn software are falling short. And WIRED did a deep dive into the opaque world of predictive travel surveillance and the companies and governments that are pumping data about international travelers into AI tools meant to detect people who might be a “threat.”\nBut wait, there's more! Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\nUS Names One of the Chinese Hackers Allegedly Behind Massive Salt Typhoon Intrusions\nChina spies, the US spies, everybody spies. Mutual espionage is a geopolitical game played by virtually every nation in the world. So when the US government singles out a single hacker for espionage-focused intrusions, naming him and targeting him with sanctions, he must have spied aggressively—or effectively—enough to have made powerful people very angry.\nThe US Treasury on Friday imposed sanctions on Yin Kecheng, a 39-year old Chinese man accused of being involved in both the breach of nine US telecommunications companies carried out by the Chinese hacker group known as Salt Typhoon, as well as another recent breach of the US Treasury. In a statement about the news, Treasury alleges that Yin is affiliated with China’s Ministry of State Security and has been a “cyber actor” for over a decade. It also imposed sanctions on Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology, a company that Treasury says is also associated with Salt Typhoon.\nSalt Typhoon’s breach of US telecoms gave Chinese hackers enormous access to the real-time texts and phone calls of Americans, and was reportedly used to spy on president-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect JD Vance, among other targets. FBI director Christopher Wray has called the telecom breaches China’s \"most significant cyberespionage campaign in history.”\nChina’s Silk Typhoon Hackers Targeted Sanctions and Intelligence in Treasury Breach\nAs the Treasury hits back at China’s spy operations, it’s also still working to determine the scope of the intrusion some of those same hackers carried out inside its network. An internal Treasury report obtained by Bloomberg found that hackers had penetrated at least 400 of the agency’s PCs and stolen more than 3,000 files in a recent breach. The espionage-focused intrusion appears to have gone after sanctions and law-enforcement related information, the report found, as well as other intelligence materials. Despite that vast access, the intruders didn’t gain access to Treasury’s emails or classified portions of its network, the report states, nor did they leave behind malware that would suggest an attempt at maintaining longer-term access.\nFBI Uninstalls Chinese PlugX Malware From Thousands of Machines\nThe Justice Department revealed this week that the FBI carried out an operation to delete a specimen of malware known as PlugX from 4,200 computers around the world. The malware, which was typically transmitted to computers via infected USB drives, has persisted for at least a decade and been used at times by Chinese state-sponsored hacker groups to target Chinese dissidents. In July of last year, cybersecurity firm Sekoia and French law enforcement took over the command-and-control server behind the malware. This week, the FBI obtained a court order that allowed the bureau to send a self-destruct command to the software on infected machines.\nVictims of “PowerSchool” Edtech Data Breach Say “All” of Their Student and Teacher Info Was Stolen\nAfter news earlier this week of a cyberattack in December that breached the US education technology platform PowerSchool, school districts targeted in the intrusion told TechCrunch on Thursday that attackers gained access to “all” stored student and teacher data in their accounts. PowerSchool is used by more than 60 million K-12 students in the US. Hackers gained access to the information by stealing login credentials that gave them access to the company’s customer support portal. The attack has not yet been publicly linked to a specific perpetrator. PowerSchool has not yet disclosed the exact number of victim schools nor whether all of its customers were affected.",

Meanwhile, US officials are still scrambling to get a handle on multiple espionage campaigns and other data breaches, with new revelations this week that a breach of AT&amp;T disclosed last summer <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-likely-stole-fbi-call-logs-from-att-that-could-compromise-informants/\">compromised FBI call and text logs that could reveal the identity of anonymous sources</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Huione Guarantee, the massive online marketplace that researchers say provides an array of services to online scammers, is expanding its offerings to include a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-black-box-of-predictive-travel-surveillance/\">messaging app, stablecoin, and crypto exchange and has facilitated a whopping $24 billion in transactions</a>, according to new research. New findings indicate that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/githubs-deepfake-porn-crackdown-still-isnt-working/\">GitHub’s efforts to crack down on the use of deepfake porn software are falling short</a>. And WIRED did a deep dive into the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-black-box-of-predictive-travel-surveillance/\">opaque world of predictive travel surveillance and the companies and governments that are pumping data</a> about international travelers into AI tools meant to detect people who might be a “threat.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">But wait, there's more! Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">China spies, the US spies, everybody spies. Mutual espionage is a geopolitical game played by virtually every nation in the world. So when the US government singles out a single hacker for espionage-focused intrusions, naming him and targeting him with sanctions, he must have spied aggressively—or effectively—enough to have made powerful people very angry.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">The US Treasury on Friday imposed sanctions on Yin Kecheng, a 39-year old Chinese man accused of being involved in both the breach of nine US telecommunications companies carried out by the Chinese hacker group known as Salt Typhoon, as well as another recent breach of the US Treasury. In a statement about the news, Treasury alleges that Yin is affiliated with China’s Ministry of State Security and has been a “cyber actor” for over a decade. It also imposed sanctions on Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology, a company that Treasury says is also associated with Salt Typhoon.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Salt Typhoon’s breach of US telecoms gave Chinese hackers enormous access to the real-time texts and phone calls of Americans, and was reportedly used to spy on president-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect JD Vance, among other targets. FBI director Christopher Wray has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86w2evj05do\">called</a> the telecom breaches China’s \"most significant cyberespionage campaign in history.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">As the Treasury hits back at China’s spy operations, it’s also still working to determine the scope of the intrusion some of those same hackers carried out inside its network. An internal Treasury report obtained by Bloomberg found that hackers had penetrated at least 400 of the agency’s PCs and stolen more than 3,000 files in a recent breach. The espionage-focused intrusion appears to have gone after sanctions and law-enforcement related information, the report found, as well as other intelligence materials. Despite that vast access, the intruders didn’t gain access to Treasury’s emails or classified portions of its network, the report states, nor did they leave behind malware that would suggest an attempt at maintaining longer-term access.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The Justice Department revealed this week that the FBI carried out an operation to delete a specimen of malware known as PlugX from 4,200 computers around the world. The malware, which was typically transmitted to computers via infected USB drives, has persisted for at least a decade and been used at times by Chinese state-sponsored hacker groups to target Chinese dissidents. In July of last year, cybersecurity firm Sekoia and French law enforcement took over the command-and-control server behind the malware. This week, the FBI obtained a court order that allowed the bureau to send a self-destruct command to the software on infected machines.</p><p class=\"paywall\">After news earlier this week of a cyberattack in December that breached the US education technology platform PowerSchool, school districts targeted in the intrusion told TechCrunch on Thursday that attackers gained access to “all” stored student and teacher data in their accounts. PowerSchool is used by more than 60 million K-12 students in the US. Hackers gained access to the information by stealing login credentials that gave them access to the company’s customer support portal. The attack has not yet been publicly linked to a specific perpetrator. PowerSchool has not yet disclosed the exact number of victim schools nor whether all of its customers were affected.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "As the United States scrambles to kick China out of its communications networks, Jessica Rosenworcel, the outgoing Democratic chair of the Federal Communications Commission, says it’s vital for her Republican successor to maintain strong oversight of the telecommunications industry.\nThe government is still reeling from the Chinese “Salt Typhoon” hacking campaign that penetrated at least nine US telecom companies and gave Beijing access to Americans’ phone calls and text messages and the wiretap systems used by law enforcement. The operation exploited US carriers’ shockingly poor cybersecurity, including an AT&T administrator account that lacked basic security protections.\nTo prevent a repeat of the unprecedented telecom intrusion, Rosenworcel used the waning days of her FCC leadership to propose new cybersecurity requirements for telecom operators. On Thursday, the commission narrowly voted to approve her proposal. But those rules face a bleak future, with president-elect Donald Trump preparing to take office and control of the FCC transferring to commissioner Brendan Carr, a Trump ally who voted against Rosenworcel’s regulatory plan.\nIn an interview days before Trump’s inauguration, Rosenworcel is adamant that regulation is part of the answer to America’s telecom security crisis. And she has a stern message for Republicans who think the solution is to let the telecoms police themselves.\n“We are wrestling with what has been described as the worst telecommunications hack in our nation's history,” she says. “Either you take serious action or you don't.”\n“The Right Thing to Do”\nRosenworcel’s plan consists of two steps. First, the FCC formally declared that the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which required telecom companies to design their phone and internet systems to comply with wiretaps, also requires them to implement basic cyber defenses to prevent tampering. Next, the FCC proposed requiring a wider range of companies regulated by the commission to develop detailed cyber risk-management plans and annually attest to their implementation.\nThe outgoing chairwoman describes the rules as a commonsense response to a devastating attack.\n“In the United States in 2025, it would shock most consumers to know that our networks do not have minimum cybersecurity standards,” Rosenworcel says. “We're asking the carriers to develop a plan and certify they follow that plan. That's the right thing to do.”\nAbsent these standards, she adds, “our networks are going to lack the protection they need from nation-state threats like this in the future.”\nBut Republicans are unlikely to embrace the new regulations on telecom networks. The powerful telecom industry tends to staunchly oppose any new regulations, and Republicans almost always side with the industry in these debates.\nSenator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who now chairs the Commerce Committee, called Rosenworcel’s plan “a Band-Aid at best and a concealment of a serious blind spot at worst” during a hearing in December.\nCarr—who last month called Salt Typhoon “deeply concerning”—voted against Rosenworcel’s proposal, along with his fellow Republican commissioner Nathan Simington. Carr’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment about the new regulations. But he has repeatedly criticized Rosenworcel’s approach to enforcing rules on the telecom industry, accusing her of overreach and warning that the FCC must rein itself in or face pushback from courts.\nOnce Carr takes over as FCC chairman, he could call a new vote of the commission to rescind Rosenworcel’s regulations. Or he could let Republican lawmakers do it for him—the GOP-controlled Congress is already planning to undo another FCC rule and might be happy to add this one to their list.\nRosenworcel dismisses the idea that her plan is radical. “We are not reinventing the wheel here,” she says. The new cyber requirements would be pegged to existing consensus standards from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n“Voices from the left and the right have called this the worst telecommunications hack in our nation's history,” Rosenworcel says. “It deserves a serious response.”\nModernizing an Old Law\nOne potential challenge facing Rosenworcel’s plan is that it hinges on the 30-year-old CALEA, which says almost nothing about cybersecurity.\nSection 105 of the law does require telecoms to ensure that wiretaps “can be activated only in accordance with a court order or other lawful authorization,” which Rosenworcel reads as a requirement to protect telecom networks from unauthorized access. But after the US Supreme Court’s recent ruling that courts shouldn’t defer to agencies as the experts in their policies, the FCC will almost certainly face an industry lawsuit as it tries to implement Rosenworcel’s plan.\nCarr may have opposed the proposal in part for that reason. He has repeatedly cheered court decisions invalidating Biden administration tech policies and the FCC’s own previous actions, and in congressional testimony last July, he cited the risk of courtroom setbacks in opposing FCC subsidies for school and library Wi-Fi hot spots (the FCC program that Congress is preparing to invalidate). “Following the Supreme Court’s decision,” he said, “courts will not defer to an FCC decision to read into the Communications Act a grant of authority that Congress did not provide.”\nRosenworcel defends the use of CALEA, saying “we have to step back and look at it from a broader point of view.” Section 105 clearly supports the conclusion that “every telecommunications carrier has a legal obligation to secure their networks against unlawful access and interception,” she argues.\nThe chairwoman admits that her proposal is “a modern way to think about” CALEA, but she says her staff “worked closely with our general counsel's office” to ensure its legality.\n“This is the right and proper interpretation of the law that meets the moment we're in and the threats we face,” she says.\nNew Sheriff in Town\nAs the Rosenworcel era gives way to the Carr era at the FCC, one open question is how the commission’s relationship with the telecom industry will change, and how that will affect the companies’ commitment to improving cybersecurity.\nBusinesses typically have friendlier relationships with independent regulators when they’re led by Republicans, who tend to favor hands-off approaches to overseeing their industries. From that perspective, telecom firms—which slammed the FCC for its recently thwarted attempt to reinstate net neutrality—are likely to welcome Carr’s promises to rein in the commission’s “overreach.”\nBut it is unclear how that shift will affect the incentives driving telecoms’ investments in better cybersecurity practices. Security experts have already expressed concerns about the broader Trump administration’s likely retreat from Biden-era cyber rules for critical infrastructure operators. A similar trend could play out with the FCC in the telecom space.\nUncertain Future for an Ambitious Agenda\nEven beyond Salt Typhoon’s breach of US telecom systems, there are many questions about how the FCC will tackle cybersecurity after Rosenworcel departs.\n“One of the hallmarks of my tenure has been that we put network security and national security front and center,” she says. “I've been in and around the FCC for a long time, and this issue has never had top-tier billing like it has during my time here.”\nRosenworcel’s initiatives included banning Chinese wireless firms from providing services in the US, prohibiting telecom equipment manufacturers linked to foreign adversaries from selling their products in the US, and running a multibillion-dollar program to help US carriers “rip and replace” that risky equipment.\nUnder Rosenworcel, the FCC also proposed rules to secure the internet’s traffic-routing system, protect undersea cables from tampering, and update 16-year-old data-breach notification procedures; launched a privacy and data protection task force; created a pilot program to help schools and libraries improve their cyber defenses; and fined the major US wireless carriers for selling access to customers’ locations. Most recently, Rosenworcel worked with the White House to launch an FCC-run security labeling program for internet-of-things devices.\nThe rip-and-replace program is an especially ambitious effort. More than 100 US wireless carriers have reported using equipment made by risky companies like China’s Huawei. But Rosenworcel is confident that the program—which recently received a $3 billion infusion from Congress—is on the right track. “We're doing a good job working with carriers to take this equipment out,” she says.\nRosenworcel isn’t worried that carriers will simply refuse to participate. “If you have this equipment in your networks, you can't get funds from FCC programs,” she says. “Right there, you have a pretty powerful incentive.” She thinks that incentive will be especially strong for the most vulnerable organizations: the small, rural carriers that heavily depend on federal subsidies.\nThe IoT labeling program, known as the US Cyber Trust Mark, might be even more ambitious, given that its goal is to completely change how consumers and businesses think about the importance of cybersecurity in home appliances. But Rosenworcel says a lot of manufacturers are “very excited” about getting their products tested and marked with the federal seal of approval, because “they see it as a way to differentiate their products in the marketplace.”\nAs for consumers, Rosenworcel admits that they may not start shopping based on security right away, but she compares the program to Energy Star, which launched in 1992 and is now a household name. “This is an iterative process,” she says. “It's going to create its own momentum over time, and these are just early days.”\nWhile a group of FCC-designated organizations devise specific testing criteria for the program, Rosenworcel is concerned that other countries may leap ahead with their own security labels. South Korea and Singapore signed an agreement in December 2023 to mutually recognize each other’s labels. The US and the European Union are working on similar reciprocity. “There will be a race globally to develop these kind of marks,” Rosenworcel says. “This is an area where I think the US should really invest some time, energy, and effort, because I would like us to lead.”\nEscaping the “Analog Era”\nAs she counts down her final days atop the FCC, Rosenworcel is preoccupied with how Salt Typhoon has highlighted alarming vulnerabilities in systems that underpin American prosperity.\n“Network security is national security,” she says. “Communications is an input in everything we do in day-to-day life. You don't have health care, manufacturing, energy, transportation, any of it without secure communications.”\nThose dependencies have put the US in increasing jeopardy as foreign government hackers exploit these networks’ complexity and inconsistency.\n“We have portions [of networks] that are gleaming new and operate on internet protocols, and we've got others that are built for the analog era,” Rosenworcel notes. “There are consequences to having networks like this that are overseen by commercial actors … Some equipment and facilities have not been updated.”\nRepublicans may be tempted to leave it up to the industry to shore up these vulnerabilities. But Rosenworcel says that would be a costly mistake.\n“We have a choice to make,” she says. “We take action to prevent this from happening in the future, or we turn the other way, cross our fingers, and hope it never happens again. I like hope, but hope isn't a plan. And when you look at the scope of the threats that we're facing, it would be foolhardy to just rely on hope at this point.”",

    "content_text": "The US Supreme Court upheld a law on Friday that could result in a ban on TikTok in the United States this Sunday.\n“There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,” the court's unanimous opinion reads. “But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.”\nFor more than five years, US government officials have tried to ban or force a sale of TikTok, accusing the Chinese-owned company of sharing American user data with the Chinese government and filling feeds with pro-China propaganda. Congress and agencies like the FBI have not provided the public with much information that confirms these allegations, but pursued a variety of different methods to ban TikTok.\nResponding to the decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew released a video on the platform thanking incoming president Donald Trump for supporting the app. \"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform,” Chew said. “One who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspective connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process.\"\nChew did not comment on whether TikTok would officially shut down on Sunday, but said “Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery, as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come.”\nIn 2020, former president Donald Trump first attempted to ban TikTok through a failed executive order. Ultimately, President Joe Biden signed into law a bill on April 24, 2024, requiring TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app to an American owner by January 19 or be removed from US app stores. In a rush to stave off the ban, TikTok and a group of creators quickly filed lawsuits against the Justice Department, arguing that the law, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, violates their First Amendment rights.\nIn Friday’s oral arguments, TikTok’s lawyer Noel Francisco and Jeffrey Fisher, who represents the creators, attempted to drive home that argument. For the government, solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the law did not violate the free speech rights of the defendants, and instead severed the app from ByteDance and Chinese influence.\n“Without doubt, the remedy Congress and the President chose here is dramatic,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a concurring opinion. “Whether this law will succeed in achieving its ends, I do not know. A determined foreign adversary may just seek to replace one lost surveillance application with another. As time passes and threats evolve, less dramatic and more effective solutions may emerge.”\nIn its opinion, the court casts doubt on TikTok’s central argument that the law violated the company’s free speech rights, writing that the “challenged provisions are facially content neutral.” The justices wrote that the law does not appear to regulate the speech of TikTok or its creators, and instead targets the app and ByteDance’s corporate structure.\n“It is not clear that the Act itself directly regulates protected expressive activity, or conduct with an expressive component,” the opinion reads. “And it directly regulates Bytedance Ltd. and TikTok only through the divestiture requirements.”\nThe justices note that their decision should be seen as “narrowly focused” and applies strictly to TikTok. “TikTok’s scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the Government’s national security concerns,” the opinion reads.\nThe law allows Biden to extend the January 19 deadline an additional 90 days so long as ByteDance is nearing a sale. As of Wednesday, the Biden administration is reportedly searching for ways to save the app, but it has not disclosed anything publicly. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED on Friday. A handful of US-based financiers have lined up to buy the app, including former LA Dodgers owner Frank McCourt. Kevin O’Leary, or “Mr. Wonderful,” of Shark Tank fame, has signed on to McCourt’s proposal and recently met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n“We have a formal offer on the table with ByteDance. We are ready to work with the company and President Trump to complete a deal. Together, we can transition TikTok to a clean tech stack and turn this national security problem into a big win for Americans,” McCourt said in a statement responding to the decision on Friday.\nWhile rumors have spread that ByteDance could be pursuing a sale with Elon Musk, TikTok and its owner have not confirmed any of these reports.\nOn Thursday, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer joined a growing chorus of US lawmakers, many of whom voted in favor of the ban, looking to give the company more time to find a suitable buyer.\nDespite being the first president to try banning TikTok, incoming president Donald Trump has suggested that he would try to broker a deal that could save the app once he returns to the White House. In an amicus brief filed last month, Trump asked the court to pause the law from going into effect to allow for him to find a “political resolution” to save it. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is reportedly attending Trump’s inauguration on Monday.\nTrump said that he spoke with Chinese president Xi Jinping over the phone in a Friday morning Truth Social post. “It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately. We discussed balancing Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects.”\n“The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it,” Trump wrote in another Truth Social post on Friday. “My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!”\n“By refusing to block this ban, the Supreme Court is giving the executive branch unprecedented power to silence speech it doesn’t like, increasing the danger that sweeping invocations of ‘national security’ will trump our constitutional rights,” Patrick Toomey, deputy director of the ACLU’s National Security Project said in a statement on Friday.\nUnless TikTok decides to shut down the app on its own, US users will likely be able to use it for at least the near future. The law forbids mobile app stores from providing access to TikTok and would make it difficult for new users to download the app. TikTok will continue to work for users who already have the app on their phone, but they will no longer have access to updates, which could make TikTok glitchier and possibly unusable over time.",

    "content_text": "There was a time when Mark Zuckerberg didn’t regard mainstream media as the enemy. He even allowed me, a card-carrying legacy media person, into his home. In April 2018, I ventured there to hear his plans to do the right thing. It was part of my years-long embed into Facebook to write a book. For the past two years, Zuckerberg’s company had been roundly criticized for its failure to rein in disinformation and hate speech. Now the young founder had a plan to address this.\nPart of the solution, he told me, was more content moderation. He was going to hire many more humans to vet posts, even if it cost Facebook considerable capital. He would also amp up efforts to use artificial intelligence to proactively remove harmful content. “It is no longer enough to give people tools to say what they want and then just let our community flag them and try to respond after the fact,” he told me as we sat in his sunroom. “We need to get in there more and just take a more active role.” He admitted he had been slow to realize how damaging toxic content was on Facebook, but now he was committed to fixing the problem, even though it might take years. “I think we're doing the right thing,” he told me, “It’s just that we should've done it sooner.”\nSeven years later, Zuckerberg no longer thinks more moderation is the right thing. In a five-minute Reel, he characterized his actions to support it as a regretful cave-in to government jawboning about Covid and other subjects. He announced a shift away from content moderation—no more proactive takedowns and downranking of misinformation and hate speech—and the end of a fact-checking program that aimed to refute lies circulating on his platforms. Fact checks by trusted sources would be replaced by “community notes,” a crowdsourcing approach where users provide alternate views on the veracity of posts. That technique is the exact thing that he told me in 2018 was “not enough.” While he admits now his changes will allow “more bad stuff,” he says that in 2025 it is worth it for more “free expression” to thrive.\nThe policy shift was one of several moves that indicated that, whether or not Zuckerberg wanted to do this all along, Meta is positioning itself in sync with the new Trump administration. You’ve heard the litany, which has become a meme in itself. Meta promoted its top lobbyist, former GOP operative Joel Kaplan, to chief global affairs officer; he immediately appeared on Fox News (and only Fox News) to tout the new policies. Zuckerberg also announced that Meta would move employees who write and review content from California to Texas, to “help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content.” He disbanded Meta’s DEI program. (Where is Sheryl Sandberg, who was so proud of Meta’s diversity effort. Sheryl? Sheryl?) And Meta changed some of its service terms specifically to allow users to degrade LGBTQ people.\nNow that it’s been a week since Meta’s turnaround—and my first take at Zuckerberg’s speech—I am particularly haunted by one aspect: He seems to have downranked the basic practice of classic journalism, characterizing it as no better than the nonreported observations from podcasters, influencers, and countless random people on his platforms. This was hinted at in his Reel when he repeatedly used the term “legacy media” as a pejorative: a force that, in his view, urges censorship and stifles free expression. All this time I thought the opposite!\nA hint of his revised version of trustworthiness comes from the shift from fact-checkers to community notes. It’s true that the fact-checking process wasn’t working well—in part because Zuckerberg didn’t defend the checkers when ill-intentioned critics charged them with bias. It’s also reasonable to expect community notes to be a useful signal that a post might be fallacious. But the power of refutation fails when participants in the conversation reject the idea that disagreements can be resolved by convincing evidence. That’s a core difference between fact-checking—which Zuckerberg got rid of— and the community notes he’s implementing. The fact-checking worldview assumes that definitive facts, arrived at via research, talking to people, and sometimes even believing your own eyes, can be conclusive. The trick is recognizing authorities who have earned public confidence by pursuing truth. Community notes welcome alternate views—but judging which ones are reliable is all up to you. There’s something to the canard that an antidote to bad speech is more speech. But if verifiable facts can’t successfully refute easily disproven flapdoodle, we’re stuck in a suicidal quicksand of babel.\nThat’s the world that Donald Trump, Zuckerberg’s new role model, has consciously set about to realize. 60 Minutes reporter Leslie Stahl once asked Trump why he insulted reporters who were just doing their job. “You know why I do it?” he responded. “I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you.” In 2021, Trump further revealed his intent to benefit from an attack on truth. “If you say it enough and keep saying it, they’ll start to believe you,” he said during a rally. A corollary to that is if social media promotes falsehoods enough, people will believe those as well. Especially if formerly recognized authorities are discredited and demeaned.\nThat discrediting is exactly what Zuckerberg and his host Joe Rogan engaged in during a 3-hour conversation in Rogan’s Austin, Texas, podcast studio. This was Zuckerberg’s only appearance to explain his actions, another sign that he’s not kowtowing to a media establishment that he no longer feels is trustworthy or worth paying attention to. Zuckerberg and Rogan went on at length about how podcasters and influencers were more popular than mainstream reporters, because no one trusts those institutions anymore, and celebrated statistics that indicate that many people get their news from social media these days. (Though it’s still far from the dominant source.)\nLook, I am a fan of podcasts, especially the epic multi-hour interviews like Rogan’s. But as a replacement for reported news? That’s a disaster. Reporters make countless phone calls, dig through mountains of documents, and travel all over the globe to try to make sense of the world. Podcasters glean their knowledge from those reports—and maybe just as much from biased grifters, random anecdotes, and paranoid visions. Also, as interviewers, some podcasters are entertaining but not rigorous in posing tough questions. No wonder Zuckerberg chose Rogan as the single place to defend his decisions. Rogan didn’t challenge him on whether his decisions were a sop to the incoming president—he congratulated him.\nIn the same week that Rogan’s podcast dropped, Peter Thiel—the billionaire VC who led Facebook’s initial funding—published a piece in the Financial Times that resonated with the Zuckerberg/Rogan theory that the media shrouds things in darkness rather than sunlight. Thiel adopted a friend’s terminology to include the media in a sweeping conspiracy called The Distributed Idea-Suppression Complex that limits public discussion. He chortled that the internet, presumably under Trump’s influence, is helping “our liberation from the DISC prison.” (Somehow the Financial Times, which is as legacy as the media gets, escaped this prison to publish Thiel’s piece.)\nThiel’s examples of media suppression were a few cases where mainstream media–though not all of it– exercised perhaps too much caution, like the JFK assassination or, more recently, Covid. But on every single day, the thousands of journalists who still have jobs seek truth by gathering facts, whether it’s to locate a mayor’s nighttime peregrinations or to show how the FBI could have acted faster to stop a notorious swatter targeting high schools. Without facts, we cannot determine whether a cabinet nominee is worthy of a position, whether it’s proper to aid an ally, or why fighting fires in Southern California is so difficult. Of course I’m biased, but this seems rather obvious. The practice of journalism is already threatened by a post-internet failure of its traditional business models. What it didn’t see coming was a horrifyingly effective political attack on its very foundation.\nAnd now the guy who runs the biggest social networks in the world—and boasted on Rogan that because he can’t be fired, he will do anything he damn wants—has cast his lot with those who seek to tumble the distressingly vulnerable house of facts. Yes, it’s tough to control disinformation at scale. But Zuckerberg has accumulated over $200 billion of personal riches by building a platform that is part of the problem. He owes us something better than forcing his 3 billion users to sift out facts from lies, all while waving a checkered flag to the liars.\nZuckerberg knows better—after all, he let me collect facts on his company for three years. Afterwards, he messaged me congratulations. He didn’t agree with all my conclusions and said I didn’t get everything right (no examples), but he noted that he appreciated the time and effort I spent to produce a nuanced account. You know, what journalists do. On the Rogan show, Zuckerberg talked a lot about restoring masculinity to corporate culture. Maybe he should man up and fight for truth.\nTime Travel\nIn our 2018 interview, Zuckerberg was excited about building up the company’s content moderation forces and using AI to proactively take down content like hate speech and misinformation—a policy that he slammed the brakes on earlier this year. At the time, the company faced a crisis over its hosting of fake news during the 2016 election.\nBefore we wrap up I ask him—has this crisis made Facebook different?\nHis answer is both no—the mission is the same—but, in a way, yes. \"I really think the biggest shift is around being more proactive, around finding and preventing abuse. The big learning is that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility … It is no longer enough to give people tools to say what they want and then just let our community flag them and try to respond after the fact. We need to take a more active role in making sure that the tools aren't misused.\"\nZuckerberg recognizes the difficulty of remaking his systems to proactively catch harmful content. \"I think this is about a three-year transition to really build up the teams, because you can't just hire thirty thousand people overnight to go do something,” he says. \"You have to make sure that they're executing well and bring in the leadership and train them. And building up AI tools—that's not something that you could just snap your fingers on either … We'll never be fully done. But I do really think that this represents a pretty major shift in the overall business model and operating model of the company.\"\nAsk Me One Thing\nPetros asks, “Is AI model collapse similar to inbreeding?”\nThanks for the question, Petros. It's always tricky to anthropomorphize digital phenomena with actual biology. (This from a guy who wrote a book called Artificial Life.) But when you talk about AI model collapse, you are indeed referring to something that in the broadest sense can be understood by referencing a human condition. But let me back up for the uninitiated. We’ve seen the boom in AI large language models enabled by a massive influx of data to train them—basically as much human knowledge as can be input. So much that it looks like we’re running out of human-generated content to train the most recent generations of models.\nOne potential solution would be for the models themselves to create content—they can do this forever. But there are indications that if you do this a lot, it degrades the output. People have compared it to a snake eating its own tail. That’s why in the last few months I’ve seen the word ouroboros many times more than I have in my entire previous life. So in the same rough way that we talk about artificial neural nets as analogous to the networks in the brain, you can say that a collapse due to an overuse of synthetic data is like inbreeding.\nSome scientists think there’s a way around this. But I am just as happy that these limits exist. It puts a premium on quality human-created content—and incentivizes AI companies to pay for it.\nSubmit your questions in the comments below, or send an email to mail@wired.com.

    "content_text": "In olden times, people dug holes in the ground to look for gold. They called it mining. But why is gold valuable, anyway? Well, mostly because humans decided it was valuable. Yeah, but why gold? Well, one cool thing about element 79 is that it doesn't interact with the oxygen in the air, so it stays shiny all the time. Also, it's rare enough to be a status symbol. But really, money is just a social convention—we decide to make stuff worth other stuff.\nWhat about cryptocurrency? This is also made up by humans. You can “mine” crypto using a computer to do pointless, gnarly computations. These systems are usually set up so that it takes more computational power as more currency is mined, so the early coins are easily obtained and the later ones are more difficult. This also makes it like gold mining—after people find the easy stuff, you have to spend more to get more. But what happens when you use computers to solve massive problems? It's all about heat and energy. Real heat and energy.\nA Raspberry Pi Monero Miner\nTo really understand crypto mining, you sort of need to mine some crypto. So that’s what I did, using a tiny, cheap, single-board computer called a Raspberry Pi to mint Monero cryptocurrency. Yeah, this tiny setup is like digging for gold with a teaspoon, but it’s fine for studying the physics involved.\nOnce I get this beast of a machine running, I can take some measurements. In particular, I can determine the power it uses as well as the thermal output. In physics, power is the rate of energy change in units of watts (1 watt = 1 joule per second). For an electrical device, power can be calculated as the product of the input electrical current (I) and the voltage (ΔV):\nI know the Raspberry Pi runs at 5 volts, so I can just measure the electric current going into it to get the power. My meter registered a current of 0.62 amps, which gives a power of 3.1 watts. That’s 3.1 joules of energy used every second that it runs. But where does that energy go? Is there energy in cryptocurrency? No, it's all converted to thermal energy. Can we measure it? Yes we can.\nTo measure the thermal energy created, I put my Raspberry Pi in an insulated container with 1,000 milliliters of water. (Don't worry, the Pi was in a zip-lock bag so it wouldn't get wet.) Now I can measure the temperature of the water as crypto is mined. Here's the temperature as a function of time for a little over one hour of run time.\nAfter the first 20 minutes, the water temperature seemed to increase at a fairly constant rate of 0.0006 degrees Celsius per second. This increase in temperature means there is an increase in thermal energy, which we can calculate as:\nHere m is the mass of the stuff (in this case, water), and C is the specific heat capacity—the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of that substance by 1 degree Celsius. For water, C is 4.186 joules per gram per degree Celsius. So, with 1,000 ml of water and my rate of temperature change, I get that the water requires a power of 2.51 joules every second (or 2.51 watts).\nOh, look at that. Even with this rudimentary measurement system, this is pretty close to the power going into the Raspberry Pi. The difference is probably due to imperfect insulation. So you can see that the cryptocurrency power is just thermal energy. Honestly, I'm surprised it worked so well.\nShow Me the Money!\nAlthough it's possible to run a crypto miner as a way to warm your house, that's probably not why people do it. What’s the payoff? Well, let's do some quick calculations. I ran my Raspberry Pi miner for 12 hours. How much money did that produce? Wait for it … 0.00000006 XMR. Converting this to US dollars, it's 0.0012 cents (not dollars). Yes, this would be a slow way to amass a fortune. If I ran it for 12,000 hours, I still couldn’t buy a piece of chewing gum. Probably not even used chewing gum.\nAnd that’s not even accounting for the cost. I mean, mining isn't free—you have to pay for the electricity. The average cost of electricity in the US is 16.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. If I run my miner at 3 watts for 12 hours, that would be 24 watt-hours, or 0.024 KWh. Using the price of electricity, this would cost 0.41 cents. Let me just do some quick math here. Yup, 0.41 cents is more than the money I created. I'm no financial expert, but this seems like a bad business model.\nOf course, no one but a physicist would mine crypto on a Raspberry Pi. There are fancy mining machines (costing thousands of dollars) that let you mint coins faster and with less energy. The other thing to consider is the future price of a cryptocurrency. Even if the cost exceeds the reward today, maybe one day it could be worth much more. Finally, a crypto miner could be in a location with cheaper electricity. It's even possible to run a miner on solar.\nHowever, don't forget that for every joule of energy you put into a miner, you are going to produce 1 joule of thermal energy. You have to get rid of that heat, or it will cause problems for your computers. But cooling systems use more energy, and that can make it difficult to produce profitable currency.\nBut it must work, since there's quite a bit of mining in the US. In 2024, it was estimated that 2.3 percent of electrical energy went into cryptocurrency. That's quite a bit, and I'm really not sure it's the best use of our energy supply—especially since crypto is just a made-up thing.",

    "content_text": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\nSeverance, which imagines a world where a person’s work and personal lives are surgically separated, returns Friday for its long-awaited second season. While the concept of this gripping piece of science fiction is far-fetched, it touches on a question neuroscience has been trying to answer for decades: Can a person’s mind really be split in two?\nRemarkably, “split-brain” patients have existed since the 1940s. To control epilepsy symptoms, these patients underwent a surgery to separate the left and right hemispheres. Similar surgeries still happen today.\nLater research on this type of surgery showed that the separated hemispheres of split-brain patients could process information independently. This raises the uncomfortable possibility that the procedure creates two separate minds living in one brain.\nIn season one of Severance, Helly R (Britt Lower) experienced a conflict between her “innie” (the side of her mind that remembered her work life) and her “outie” (the side outside of work). Similarly, there is evidence of a conflict between the two hemispheres of real split-brain patients.\nWhen speaking with split-brain patients, you are usually communicating with the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls speech. However, some patients can communicate from their right hemisphere by writing, for example, or by arranging Scrabble letters.\nA young patient in one study was asked what job he would like in the future. His left hemisphere chose an office job making technical drawings. His right hemisphere, however, arranged letters to spell “automobile racer.”\nSplit-brain patients have also reported “alien hand syndrome,” where one of their hands is perceived to be moving of its own volition. These observations suggest that two separate conscious “people” may coexist in one brain and may have conflicting goals.\nIn Severance, however, both the innie and the outie have access to speech. This is one indicator that the fictional “severance procedure” must involve a more complex separation of the brain’s networks.\nAn example of a complex separation of function was described in the case report of Neil, in 1994. Neil was a teenage boy who had a number of difficulties following a pineal gland tumor. One of these difficulties was a rare form of amnesia. It meant that Neil could not recall the events of his day or report what he had learned in school. He had also become unable to read, although he could write, and he was unable to name objects, although he could draw them.\nAstonishingly, Neil was able to keep up with his education. Researchers became interested in how he was able to complete his schoolwork despite having no memory of what he was learning. They quizzed him about a novel he was studying at school, Cider With Rosie by Laurie Lee. In conversation, Neil could not remember anything about the book—not even the title. But when a researcher asked Neil to write down everything he could remember about the book, he wrote “Bloodshot Geranium windows Cider with Rosie Dranium smell of damp peppar [sic] and mushroom growth”—all words connected to the novel. As Neil could not read, he had to ask the researcher: “What did I write?”\nNeil was also able to write down other memories that were thought to be lost, including meeting a man with gangrene in a hospital. In each case, he was unaware of his own memory until he wrote it down and had it read back to him. Neil’s case is a staggering example. It suggests that it is possible to have rich memories that are inaccessible to our consciousness.\nIn Severance, Irving’s (John Turturro) outie can access memories of his innie’s work environment through painting. He paints the long hallways of the Severed floor (where his innie works), despite having no conscious memory of them. Perhaps then, in the show, the severance procedure involves blocking conscious access to memory in the same way that this access was blocked in Neil.\nWhich brain regions might be core to the TV show’s severance procedure? The region most associated with remembering the events of the work day is the hippocampus—and, interestingly, this same brain region also supports the representation of space.\nThe fact that the same neural structure supports both remembering that a new colleague just joined your team and representing the layout of the office suggests that the hippocampus might be a good target for this fictional procedure.\nIn Severance, the switch between innie and outie occurs at the boundary to the office—the elevator doors. This is reminiscent of “the doorway effect,” the phenomenon in which walking through a doorway makes you forget something.\nThe hippocampus segments our experience into episodes for later recall. Entering a new space is an indicator that a new episode has started, which leads to increased forgetting of information that spans these episodes. The effect is subtle, however. Although you might sometimes walk into the kitchen and forget why you went in, you don’t forget that you have children—unlike the dramatic effect caused by the show’s severance procedure. Perhaps, in Severance, the hippocampus’ interest in spatial boundaries triggers the switch between innie and outie.\nUnfortunately, there are two crucial flaws with the idea that the show’s severance procedure could involve a simple snip to the hippocampus.\nFirst, it’s not just episodic and spatial memory that is divided in Severance. The workers have a great deal of semantic knowledge (facts about Lumon, the company they work for, and its founder, for example) that is inaccessible to their outies. They also form emotional memories linked to the rewards they get for hard work and the punishments that they receive in the break room. These forms of memory rely on far more than the hippocampus, and the hippocampus itself is part of a brain-wide episodic memory network that is activated during episodic memory retrieval.\nThe second flaw is that memory itself is not an isolated process. It is closely connected to perception, attention, language, and many other processes. The human memory system is far too complex to be entirely split in two—but as Severance shows, it’s fun to think about the possibilities.",

    "content_text": "Observing the planets is one of the most awe-inspiring ways to witness the magic of the night sky—and there’s no better way to view them than in a planetary alignment. This is where multiple planets line up next to each other.\nOn January 21, six planets—Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—will be visible simultaneously in the sky, and their alignment will be easily visible from almost all parts of the globe. But if you miss the chance to observe the night sky on January 21, don’t worry: There is plenty of time to see this planetary parade.\nThe alignment will be visible for about a month, until mid to late February. The planets’ positions will, however, shift over this time, so their positions on January 21 will not be the same as their positions in late February.\nWhile conjunctions of two planets are somewhat common, alignments of five or more are quite rare. There will be two more planetary alignments featuring five or more planets this year, but after that, the next alignment of five or more planets won’t happen until 2040.\nHere’s everything you need to know to see this planetary alignment.\nHow to Watch\nTo get the best view, allow 20 to 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. You’ll want to see this planetary alignment after the sun has set and from a location far away from artificial light, which makes it hard to see objects in the night sky.\nMars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, Saturn, and Venus will appear in an arc from east to west. You can spot four of these planets with your naked eyes; however, two of them—Uranus and Neptune—require a good pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope. Exactly where in the night sky to look for each planet on the 21st is outlined below, but if you’re not sure how to find them, don’t worry—apps like Stellarium can help you easily locate the planets and other celestial objects.\nWhen to Watch\nThe best time to view the planets is shortly after sunset, because three of them—Venus, Saturn, and Neptune—set between approximately 9 and 10:30 pm local time. Note that the exact time each planet rises and sets will vary slightly according to your location on Earth; you can use a website like Time and Date to find the exact timings for where you are.\nIt’s best to start skywatching earlier in the evening if you can, because Venus, Saturn, and Neptune will move lower toward the horizon before setting, and so will become more and more difficult to see as the evening goes on.\nMars\nOn January 21, Mars will be in the east, directly under the constellation Gemini. Mars has just reached opposition—meaning the Earth is directly between it and the sun—so the Red Planet will appear at its biggest and brightest and will be visible all night.\nMars is easily visible to the naked eye. But if you use a backyard telescope, you’ll be able to see its north polar ice cap, which spans more than 600 miles, and the Vallis Marineris, the largest canyon in the solar system, which runs along Mars’ equator and is over 1,800 miles long.\nJupiter\nJupiter will be to the west of Mars, in the constellation Taurus. Jupiter is easily visible to the naked eye. However, a pair of high-powered binoculars will allow you to see Jupiter’s moons and possibly its cloud bands.\nA backyard telescope will allow you to see the giant planet in even greater detail. Look for Jupiter’s cloud bands and its stunning Red Spot, an anticyclone that is over 10,000 miles wide—1.3 times the width of Earth. The Red Spot isn’t always visible from Earth, because Jupiter’s days are about 10 hours long, meaning the storm spends a sizable portion of time facing away from Earth on a lot of nights. You can use this calculator from Sky & Telescope to see when it might be visible from your location.\nJupiter will be visible for most of the night: It rises in the mid to late afternoon on January 21 and sets between about 3 and 5 am on January 22, depending on your exact location.\nUranus\nOn the 21st, Uranus will be about 50 degrees to the west of Jupiter and slightly below it. Uranus will appear to be near the Pleiades, a bright star cluster that is visible to the naked eye.\nYou will need a pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope to see Uranus, as it’s too dim to easily see with the naked eye. Through such equipment, Uranus looks like a star with a pale blue tint. Although Uranus has rings, they are too faint to see, even with viewing equipment. However, if you have a powerful backyard telescope, you could potentially see its moons.\nUranus rises in the early to mid afternoon and sets between approximately 2 and 3 am local time on January 21–22. The presence of moonlight makes this planet impossible to view, so plan on viewing Uranus before the moon rises (which will be at around midnight).\nNeptune\nVenus, Saturn, and Neptune will be clustered above the constellation Aquarius, near the western horizon. Neptune will be about 9 degrees above and slightly to the east of Venus (that’s roughly the size of a fist held at arm’s length).\nNeptune is only visible through a pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope. Through a pair of high-powered binoculars, Neptune looks like a star. Neptune also has rings, but those rings won’t be visible through amateur stargazing equipment.\nIf you have a very powerful backyard telescope and dark skies, you might be able to see Neptune’s largest moon, Triton. However, Triton will not be visible through most backyard telescopes.\nNeptune rises between about 9:30 and 10:30 am and sets between about 9:30 and 10:30 pm local time, so plan on viewing it shortly after sunset before it sinks low on the horizon.\nVenus and Saturn\nVenus and Saturn will be low in the sky toward the west. Both Venus and Saturn are easily visible to the naked eye—Venus is the second-brightest object in the night sky, second to the moon.\nVenus and Saturn will appear closest together on January 17–18, when they will be just 2 degrees apart in a conjunction. On the 21st, they will remain close together—about 3 degrees apart—so you probably will be able to see both of them together through the lenses of high-powered binoculars or a telescope.\nVenus is too bright for you to see any details on its surface; however, you can spot Saturn’s moons and rings through a pair of skywatching binoculars or a telescope.\nVenus and Saturn rise shortly before 10:30 am local time and set between 9:30 and 10:00 pm, so you’ll want to start skywatching earlier in the evening to see these planets before they vanish below the horizon.\nViewing Conditions\nOn January 21, the moon will be a waning gibbous—so about 52 percent illuminated. However, the moon will not rise until shortly after midnight local time, so it will not interfere with your ability to see the planetary alignment if you’re viewing shortly after sunset.\nViewing conditions will remain ideal throughout the rest of January (providing there isn’t cloud cover). The illuminated part of the moon will get smaller and smaller until the new moon on January 29, and the moon will rise after midnight and in the early morning hours throughout the rest of the month, creating the perfect opportunity for skywatching after sunset. However, viewing conditions will rapidly deteriorate in the first half of February, when the moon will be fuller and visible after sunset.",

You can spot four of these planets with your naked eyes; however, two of them—Uranus and Neptune—require a good pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope. Exactly where in the night sky to look for each planet on the 21st is outlined below, but if you’re not sure how to find them, don’t worry—apps like <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://stellarium-web.org/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://stellarium-web.org/\" href=\"https://stellarium-web.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stellarium</a> can help you easily locate the planets and other celestial objects.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">When to Watch</h2><p class=\"paywall\">The best time to view the planets is shortly after sunset, because three of them—Venus, Saturn, and Neptune—set between approximately 9 and 10:30 pm local time. Note that the exact time each planet rises and sets will vary slightly according to your location on Earth; you can use a website like <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/\" href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Time and Date</a> to find the exact timings for where you are.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It’s best to start skywatching earlier in the evening if you can, because Venus, Saturn, and Neptune will move lower toward the horizon before setting, and so will become more and more difficult to see as the evening goes on.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Mars</h2><p class=\"paywall\">On January 21, Mars will be in the east, directly under the constellation Gemini. Mars has just reached opposition—meaning the Earth is directly between it and the sun—so the Red Planet will appear at its biggest and brightest and will be visible all night.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Mars is easily visible to the naked eye. But if you use a backyard telescope, you’ll be able to see its <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/northern-ice-cap-of-mars/\">north polar ice cap, which spans more than 600 miles</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/valles-marineris-grand-canyon-of-mars/\">Vallis Marineris</a>, the largest canyon in the solar system, which runs along Mars’ equator and is over 1,800 miles long.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Jupiter</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Jupiter will be to the west of Mars, in the constellation Taurus. Jupiter is easily visible to the naked eye. However, a pair of high-powered binoculars will allow you to see Jupiter’s moons and possibly its cloud bands.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A backyard telescope will allow you to see the giant planet in even greater detail. Look for Jupiter’s cloud bands and its stunning Red Spot, an anticyclone that is <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/jupiters-great-red-spot-swallows-earth/#:~:text=wide%20as%20Earth.-,Measuring%20in%20at%2010%2C159%20miles%20(16%2C350%20kilometers)%20in%20width%20(,taken%20by%20astronomer%20Christopher%20Go.\">over 10,000 miles wide</a>—1.3 times the width of Earth. The Red Spot isn’t always visible from Earth, because <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/jupiter-facts/\">Jupiter’s days are about 10 hours long</a>, meaning the storm spends a sizable portion of time facing away from Earth on a lot of nights. You can use <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/interactive-sky-watching-tools/transit-times-of-jupiters-great-red-spot/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/interactive-sky-watching-tools/transit-times-of-jupiters-great-red-spot/\" href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/interactive-sky-watching-tools/transit-times-of-jupiters-great-red-spot/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this calculator from Sky &amp; Telescope</a> to see when it might be visible from your location.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Jupiter will be visible for most of the night: It rises in the mid to late afternoon on January 21 and sets between about 3 and 5 am on January 22, depending on your exact location.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Uranus</h2><p class=\"paywall\">On the 21st, Uranus will be about 50 degrees to the west of Jupiter and slightly below it. Uranus will appear to be near <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-45/\">the Pleiades</a>, a bright star cluster that is visible to the naked eye.</p><p class=\"paywall\">You will need a pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope to see Uranus, as it’s too dim to easily see with the naked eye. Through such equipment, Uranus looks like a star with a pale blue tint. Although Uranus has rings, they are too faint to see, even with viewing equipment. However, if you have a powerful backyard telescope, you could potentially see its moons.</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nMichael Lohscheller, the new CEO of Polestar, the Sweden-based, China-controlled electric car company, yesterday claimed in a strategic review that “2025 will be the best year in the [company’s] history.” That’s largely because, profitwise, 2024 wasn’t great for Polestar, 2023 could hardly be described as stellar, and 2022 was nothing to write home about. 2021 and prior? Sadly, more of the same.\nPolestar—which started life in 2005 as the brand name for a Volvo-tuning, gasoline-powered Swedish motorsports team, then transformed into an EV marque when Volvo bought the team 10 years later—has operated independently of Volvo since 2017, and it has yet to turn a profit. It sold 44,851 cars in 2024, 12,548 of these in Q3, and on the bottom line of that period, Polestar's $323 million net loss works out to the brand losing more than $25,740 for every EV it sold.\nIn yesterday’s review, Lohscheller claimed Polestar would grow sales by 30 to 35 percent in the coming three years, and he expects positive free cash flow “after investments” in 2027, which is two years later than the company’s previous break-even prediction.\nConfirmation of the Polestar 7, an EU-manufactured compact SUV to be produced (perhaps in Slovakia) in two years or so, wasn’t enough to calm Wall Street jitters, and shares slumped by 14 percent soon after the strategic review went online. Since going public in June 2022, Polestar’s US-listed shares have declined 90 percent.\nIn December, Polestar secured $800 million from several banks with 12-month terms, and it is seeking an additional loan of $400 million. Majority-owned by Chinese billionaire Li Shufu, founder and chair of Geely—which means “lucky” in Mandarin—Polestar has suffered delays in rolling out new models and seen increased competition in the marketplace.\n“Geely will continue to support Polestar’s development and strategy implementation, including working with Polestar to secure additional equity and debt funding,” Daniel Donghui Li, Geely’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.\n“We manufacture regionally for the different regions in the world, so [we have] to be protected and make sure that we don’t depend on sudden changes,” Lohscheller stressed in yesterday’s review. “There are more offers in the market, so it becomes much more competitive,” he admitted.\n“That's good for customers, because they have more choices, but for us it means there is more pricing pressure. We have to make sure that we have a cost-competitive product—and that’s exactly what we will do going forward. And that’s why the platform strategy is of highest importance, because efficiencies have to increase, and costs have to come down.”\nLohscheller, the former boss of Opel, has been in the job for just four months, replacing Thomas Ingenlath. More of a traditional finance-focused auto CEO than design-led Ingenlath, Lohscheller has been tasked with increasing sales, but this was made harder when, earlier this week, the outgoing Biden administration announced a ban on Chinese car sales.\n“We don’t want 2 million Chinese cars on the road and then realize … we have a threat,” said US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, citing national security concerns. Late last year, Raimondo proposed a ban on Chinese automotive software starting in the 2027 model year, with a ban on Chinese-made hardware beginning in 2029.\nPolestar makes the Polestar 3 in a South Carolina factory, and last year warned that any sales ban “shuts down the operations of a lawfully organized US company with substantial US investments.”\n“The US is an important market for us,” Kim Palmer, Polestar head of PR, tells WIRED. Suggesting the speccing of non-Chinese software and other materials, Palmer adds: “We are in advanced stages to adapt our future models to make sure they comply with the regulation in terms of hardware, software, and suppliers.”\nNevertheless, Lohscheller may have to ask the Trump administration for dispensation to sell its US-manufactured cars in the US. Trump’s antipathy toward EVs is well known, but it’s unclear how much of America’s EV policy will be influenced by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n“It’s an unusual conflict of interest to see the CEO of Tesla in any way involved with EV policy for the entire country,” said Peter Wells, a business professor and director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales, UK. “There’s an enormous potential for Musk to rewrite the rules to suit Tesla’s best interests.”\nIf this proves to be the case, it could be mighty hard for Polestar to get dispensation. Perhaps that’s why, in his presentation, Lohscheller stressed Polestar’s pivot into France. A trademark dispute with Citroen—the company claimed the Polestar logo was too similar to its own—previously prevented Polestar from selling in the French market.\nHowever, there’s a potential snafu. Would-be Polestar purchasers don’t yet qualify for France’s EV subsidy. “Polestar is not on the list of companies which have been approved by France to have qualified for their ecological bonus,” says Wells. “That’s not to say they couldn’t be on it in the future, but if they can’t get qualified for that scheme, they’ve got an incentive problem.”\nLochscheller said that 2024 had been a transition year for Polestar, and that now the company would revert to a more traditional dealership-based sales model.\n“A lot of things need to change,” said Lochscheller, “starting with sales and distribution. I call it from showing to active selling. The company has done a good job setting up the direct-to-consumer baseline, now the key task is making sure that the active selling through retail partners is improving.” More showrooms, then, and less reliance on online sales—old-school thinking.\n“Our [retail] footprint is growing,” said Lochscheller, citing the fact that there are now 25 Polestar showrooms in Sweden, 20 more than last year, and 20 showrooms in the UK, up from eight last year.\n“By expanding dealership sales, Polestar can reach more customers, thereby increasing overall sales volume,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, publisher of the Kelley Blue Book vehicle valuer, tells WIRED. “Customers are more likely to invest in a brand they can interact with and rely on,” she says.\nWells agrees: “Polestar, under new leadership, is now finally going to focus on being better at retail, and being better at bringing the revenues in. They’re going back to the traditional [automotive] sales model and presenting themselves to consumers in a less exotic way.”\nLochscheller, Wells says, is instilling in Polestar a “sense of conservatism, an attempt to cut costs, drive up volumes, adopt a more traditional marketing strategy, and generate enough revenue to survive.”\nPolestar cars are available in 27 countries. Production of the Polestar 4 will start in South Korea in the second half of 2025. Polestar 5, a Porsche Taycan-rivaling GT, is due to go on sale later this year and is built on the brand’s first bespoke EV architecture. The proposed Polestar 7 could do well in the US, claims Streaty. “Developing a vehicle in the premium compact SUV segment is a smart move,” she says.\nWith break-even still at least two years away, Polestar will likely need additional financing to see it through to profitability. But Polestar—reliant on support from its ultimate Chinese owner—may not have two years, claims Wells. “The Chinese EV market is booming, but there’s lots of competition, with rampant price cutting. The risk for Polestar is that their financial support may not last. Polestar might become an extravagance too far for Geely. Market conditions are moving faster than company strategic plans.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThere still might be some deus ex machina that saves TikTok—or at least puts things on hold—but for now the imminent ban on the social media app has been upheld by the US Supreme Court.\nSo what about all those videos you’ve posted ? They might be vacation vlogs, scathing reaction videos, or just lighthearted memes, but you likely worked hard on them, and it would be a shame to lose them.\nJust to be clear, under the terms of the ban, existing users will still be able to use TikTok; you just won’t get software updates. So if you want to download those videos for safekeeping, you’re not necessarily under the gun to get it done by Sunday. Then again, TikTok’s lawyer told the court it would “go dark” on Sunday if the ban were not overturned … No one knows what that means.\nYou should be able to download any video you’ve published to the platform. You can also download other creators’ videos if they’ve made the videos public and enabled the privacy setting that lets other users download their clips. If you follow our steps below and don’t see the option to save locally, it’s likely the creator has restricted the sharing permissions.\nIf you’re a creator who wants to back up your own clips, or you just want to hoard your all-time TikTok faves, here’s how.\nJanuary 2025: This article was updated to reflect current information and details about downloading TikTok videos.\nSave TikTok Videos to Your Phone\nFor most people, TikTok is a purely mobile experience: They watch, create, and post videos entirely with their phones. If you’re a mobile-first TikTok creator, then the videos you’ve shot may already be saved somewhere on your phone. But maybe you’ve switched phones, or you’ve deleted local copies of those old videos to free up space. If your videos are only stored in TikTok’s cloud, you can still likely download all of them onto your phone.\nIt’s a bit easier to download videos onto a computer than it is to get them onto your phone. There are a few extra steps on mobile, so if you have dozens or even hundreds of videos to back up, maybe follow the instructions listed further down that explain how to get the videos onto your computer instead.\nHere are the instructions for iPhones and Android devices:\nGo to any TikTok video. On your own videos, tap the three dots in the lower-right corner of the screen. For videos by other creators that are available to download, tap the arrow-shaped Share button in the same area.\nA series of gray icons will appear along the bottom of the screen. Tap the one that says Save Video.\nA percentage counter will appear onscreen, indicating that the app is processing the video. This usually goes very quickly, so you might not even see it, but that depends on the speed of your connection.\nNext, an array of sharing options pop up. Scroll to the right and click the three dots. Here, you can choose the email option to send the file to yourself as an attachment, or upload it to a cloud service like Google Drive. There will be even more options based on your smartphone’s apps. Look for any options that allow you to save the video locally.\nOn Android, the best option for saving a video to your phone will be labeled Files by Google. Tap this icon to download the video to your phone, then use Android’s built-in Files app to browse your downloads. On iOS, look for the option Save to Files, then choose to save the video either in your device’s internal storage or in your iCloud drive.\nDownload TikTok Videos to Your Computer\nThe simplest option for collecting your work is to download the videos from TikTok’s website or desktop app. This process is very easy compared to the mobile option.\nGo to your favorite video on TikTok.com and right-click on it. If you’re looking at your own video and you’re logged in to your account, or if the video’s creator has marked their posts as downloadable, there will be an option in the right-click menu that says Download Video.\nClick that option.\nCongrats, you’ve done it! The video will be saved as an MP4 in your downloads folder.\nIf you don’t see the option to download the video when you right-click, that probably means the creator hasn’t shared the video publicly or has chosen to disallow downloads.\nUse Screen Record\nIt’s not the tidiest option, but you can also record a copy of the video via screen record on your phone. Screen record basically takes a video screenshot; once turned on, it will record whatever is playing on your screen until you hit Stop. Play the TikTok clip while screen recording and you’ll have a quick-and-dirty copy saved to your device.\nYou’ll need to play the video all the way through in real time. Keep in mind that this will capture everything that happens on the screen while you’re recording, so if a notification pops up or you swipe to another app, that will all be in the video. It also means you’ll still see all the menu buttons and text that are normally around the edges of the screen in a TikTok video, so it won’t be a perfectly clean copy, nor the best quality, but it may be better than nothing.\nYou can record your screen on iOS and on Android phones with Android 11 or higher.\nTo do this on iOS 18, first swipe down from the top right of your screen to access the Control Center. If you already see a gray circle with a white dot icon there, this is what you need to tap to start recording. If you don't, click and hold a blank space to edit your controls. Click Add a Control, and find it manually or search for it.\nOn older versions of iOS, you will have to do this slightly different, by heading to Settings > Control Center and pressing the + icon next to Screen Recording.\nFor Android users, swipe down from the top of your screen to bring up your notifications and settings screen. From there, you might have to expand the menu at top and swipe through your settings widgets. Look for Screen Record. Tap that and you’ll have options to record device audio as well as whether to show touches on the screen. Tap Start to record.\nWhat’s With the Watermark?\nIf you’ve downloaded your videos, you probably noticed the faint TikTok watermark in the frame. This watermark will appear in any videos you’ve published as well as in videos you download from other creators. Unfortunately, there’s no official way to download a video directly from the platform after it’s been posted without that watermark being applied. If a video is still in your drafts in the TikTok app—meaning you’ve shot and edited it but not posted it yet—you can select the Save Video option and download a version of it without the watermark.\nIn general, if you’re creating videos, your best bet is to use a separate video editing app to edit your video before posting it online. That way you’ll always have the original cut and not have to worry about whether your distribution platform—and all your hard work—is about to suddenly go poof.",

It also means you’ll still see all the menu buttons and text that are normally around the edges of the screen in a TikTok video, so it won’t be a perfectly clean copy, nor the best quality, but it may be better than nothing.</p><p class=\"paywall\">You can record your screen on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/ios/\">iOS</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/android/\">Android</a> phones with Android 11 or higher.</p><p class=\"paywall\">To do this on <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935\" href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a> 18, first swipe down from the top right of your screen to access the <strong>Control Center.</strong> If you already see a gray circle with a white dot icon there, this is what you need to tap to start recording. If you don't, click and hold a blank space to edit your controls. Click <strong>Add a Control</strong>, and find it manually or search for it.</p><p class=\"paywall\">On older versions of iOS, you will have to do this slightly different, by heading to <strong>Settings &gt; Control Center</strong> and pressing the + icon next to <strong>Screen Recording</strong>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">For <a href=\"https://support.google.com/android/answer/9075928?hl=en\">Android</a> users, swipe down from the top of your screen to bring up your notifications and settings screen. From there, you might have to expand the menu at top and swipe through your settings widgets. Look for <strong>Screen Record</strong>. Tap that and you’ll have options to record device audio as well as whether to show touches on the screen. Tap Start to record.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">What’s With the Watermark?</h2><p class=\"paywall\">If you’ve downloaded your videos, you probably noticed the faint TikTok watermark in the frame. This watermark will appear in any videos you’ve published as well as in videos you download from other creators. Unfortunately, there’s no official way to download a video directly from the platform after it’s been posted without that watermark being applied. If a video is still in your drafts in the TikTok app—meaning you’ve shot and edited it but not posted it yet—you can select the Save Video option and download a version of it without the watermark.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In general, if you’re <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-upgrade-youtube-recording-setup/\">creating videos</a>, your best bet is to use a separate video editing app to edit your video before posting it online. That way you’ll always have the original cut and not have to worry about whether your distribution platform—and all your hard work—is about to suddenly go poof.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "The Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu—better known internationally as RedNote—is scrambling to boost its ability to moderate English-language content after hundreds of thousands of American users suddenly joined the platform in anticipation of TikTok potentially being banned in the United States on Sunday.\nWIRED identified a handful of job listings posted to recruitment platforms by tech outsourcing companies in China this week for content moderators who can help manage the unexpected influx of English videos and posts being uploaded to Xiaohongshu. (There were also several new recruitment notices posted looking for content moderators who can work in Chinese, the platform’s default language.)\nVXI Global Solutions, an American customer service company that has operated in China since the early 2000s, posted job vacancies on the recruitment websites Zhilian Zhaopin and BOSS Zhipin, specifying that candidates would be “moderating the videos by accounts of foreign friends on Xiaohongshu.” The recruiter even labeled one of the listings “Xiaohongshu overnight urgent recruitment—TikTok refugee moderation, short-term [contracts] accepted.”\nJinhui Rongzhi Technology, an IT service outsourcing company, and Transn, an AI-powered translation service provider, also posted similar recruitment notices this week looking for English-speaking content moderators to work for Xiaohongshu. WIRED contacted the three companies to confirm the validity of the listings. None of them responded in time for publication. Xiaohongshu also did not immediately return a request for comment.\nThe salary for the jobs range from 4,500 RMB to 8,000 RMB a month (about $600 to $1,100). Applicants are required to demonstrate their English language skills and prove they passed a proficiency exam. One listing noted that the position must be filled within three days, and candidates need not apply if they can’t start immediately.\nChina’s Cyberspace Administration, the country’s top internet watchdog, has reportedly already grown concerned about content being shared by foreigners on Xiaohongshu. CAC warned the platform earlier this week to “ensure China-based users can’t see posts from US users,” according to The Information.\nSocial media platforms in China are legally required to remove a wide range of content, including nudity and graphic violence, but especially information that the government deems politically sensitive. Platforms like Xiaohongshu rely on large teams of contractors managed by outsourcing companies to do both routine enforcement as well as respond to emergency situations.\n“RedNote—like all platforms owned by Chinese companies—is subject to the Chinese Communist Party’s repressive laws,” wrote Allie Funk, research director for technology and democracy at the nonprofit human rights organization Freedom House, in an email to WIRED. “Independent researchers have documented how keywords deemed sensitive to those in power, such as discussion of labor strikes or criticism of Xi Jinping, can be scrubbed from the platform.”\nBut the influx of American TikTok users—as many as 700,000 in merely two days, according to Reuters—could be stretching Xiaohongshu’s content moderation abilities thin, says Eric Liu, an editor at China Digital Times, a California-based publication documenting censorship in China, who also used to work as a content moderator himself for the Chinese social media platform Weibo.\nLiu said it’s nearly impossible for Xiaohongshu to quickly recruit so many moderators who speak English. “Content moderation isn’t something you can just do through translation tools. It’s a very sophisticated job,” that “requires the person to speak the relevant languages.”\nLiu reposted a screenshot on Bluesky showing that some people who recently joined Xiaohongshu have received notifications that their posts can only be shown to other users after 48 hours, seemingly giving the company time to determine whether they may be violating any of the platform’s rules. This is a sign that Xiaohongshu’s moderation teams are unable to react swiftly, Liu says.\nChina Digital Times previously published a 2020 internal instruction manual for Xiaohongshu content moderators that explained how they should respond to “sudden incidents.” Liu notes that Xiaohongshu is not an app commonly used for political discussions, but nevertheless, the manual shows that moderators were told to be prepared for any accidental political content users might share. Regarding the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, the document asks that moderators be careful to ensure that travel photos from the city don’t include landmarks like the Pillar of Shame, which commemorated lives lost in the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, or depict demonstrators on the streets, Liu says.\nAs in other parts of the world, content moderation is one of the most tedious and low-paying jobs in China’s tech industry. Social media platforms often outsource the role to companies that hire moderators on a contract basis, allowing tech giants to avoid providing the same benefits to these workers as they do to full-time employees.\nWhile the majority of the new TikTok refugees still appear to be enjoying their time on Xiaohongshu, some have already had their posts censored. Christine Lu, a Taiwanese-American tech entrepreneur who created a Xiaohongshu account on Wednesday, says she was suspended after uploading three provocative posts about Tiananmen, Tibet, and Taiwan. “I support more [Chinese and American] people engaging directly. But also, knowing China, I knew it wouldn’t last for long,” Lu tells WIRED.\nThe fact that Americans are now flocking to a domestic Chinese social media platform that blatantly removes content deemed unacceptable by the Chinese government demonstrates the ineffectiveness of trying to ban a single app like TikTok in the first place, says Funk. “A more sustainable approach to dealing with the potential risks presented by TikTok, RedNote, or any Chinese-owned app is passing legislation that strengthens data privacy and cybersecurity and requires social media platforms to operate with more transparency,” she says.",

    "content_text": "A crypto investor has brought a class action lawsuit against Pump.Fun, a platform for launching and investing in meme-inspired cryptocurrencies, after suffering trading losses.\nRepresenting the plaintiffs are Wolf Popper and Burwick Law, the two firms handling a separate class action brought by investors in December over a memecoin launched by web personality Haliey Welch, better known as the Hawk Tuah girl, which collapsed in value soon after trading began. (Welch was not named as a defendant in that suit.)\n“These ‘emperor’s new clothes’ crypto schemes can’t keep masquerading as legitimate finance, leaving the vulnerable in the lurch,\" says Max Burwick, founding partner at Burwick Law.\nPump.Fun was a hit when launched in January 2024, giving people a way to launch memecoins—highly volatile cryptocurrencies that typically have no inherent purpose beyond speculation—instantly and at no cost. The new lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York, alleges that Pump.Fun has operated as an unregistered securities issuer and seller. In making marketing claims that downplay the likelihood of losing money trading memecoins, the complaint alleges, the platform also put investors at heightened financial risk.\nSeparately, the lawsuit alleges that these memecoin platforms, like Pump.Fun, are designed in such a way as to incentivize pump-and-dump activity. “Early investors or insiders artificially inflate token prices through coordinated buying and promotional campaigns, then sell their holdings at peak prices, causing the token's value to collapse and leaving later investors with substantial losses,” the complaint claims.\nThe complaint points to the circumstances around the launch of a particular Pump.Fun memecoin—PNUT, which references the celebrity squirrel euthanized last year in New York—to evidence its claims.\nPump.Fun did not respond to a request for comment. But in an interview with WIRED last year, Noah Tweedale, one of the three Pump.Fun cofounders named in the suit, refuted the idea that the platform stands to benefit from regular investors losing money. “The idea with Pump was to build something where everyone was on the same playing field,” Tweedale said. “I want to stress, we don’t want people to lose money on our platform. It doesn’t benefit us by any means.”\nMore than 6 million unique memecoins have been launched through Pump.Fun, the most successful of which are valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. The memecoin market is now worth in excess of $100 billion in aggregate, market data shows.\nIn its first 12 months in operation, Pump.Fun is reported by third parties to have generated more than $350 million in revenue, taking a 1 percent cut of trades. The platform is on pace to make more than $1 billion in revenue in 2025.\nHowever, the lawsuit brought by the crypto investor—which follows reports of unethical trading activity, criticism relating to content moderation, and a warning issued against Pump.Fun by the UK financial regulator—could threaten to put a dampener on the runaway growth.\nThe lawsuit hinges on the idea that memecoins should in some circumstances be classified as securities, a particular type of investment instrument. The complaint claims that by failing to register token sales with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the relevant US financial regulator, Pump.Fun allegedly violated securities laws and denied investors the disclosures required of regulated entities.\nWhether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities is a long-running debate that has spawned a mess of litigation between the SEC and cryptocurrency companies. Though the SEC has not pursued many memecoin-related cases to date, in the lawsuit against Pump.Fun, the crypto investor alleges that all memecoins issued through the platform resemble securities by virtue of the way they are marketed.\n“This largely turns on the question of an expectation of returns through marketing promises,” says Burwick. “The issue with almost every memecoin is: How was this marketed?” Essentially, if a creator or issuing platform suggests that a coin is headed to the moon, Burwick believes it is a security.\nIn the interview with WIRED, Tweedale rejected the idea that memecoins might fall under the purview of the SEC. “Memecoins being securities is a joke. That can’t be the case,” he said.\nElsewhere, the lawsuit alleges that Pump.Fun essentially gamified the trading experience and engaged in a \"sophisticated marketing campaign\" that combined \"promises of exponential returns, luxury lifestyle imagery, and coordinated social media promotion,” which had the effect of obfuscating the risk profile of memecoin investing.\nThe architecture of the Pump.Fun platform, which relies upon a mathematical mechanism known as a bonding curve to eliminate the cost of issuing a memecoin for creators, amplifies the potential financial harm by creating a dynamic whereby early buyers benefit disproportionately, the investor has alleged.\nMeanwhile, in failing to verify the age or identity of its users, Pump.Fun exposes minors and inexperienced investors to both financial risk and the explicit material rife on the platform, the complaint alleges. In December, Tweedale told WIRED that Pump.Fun plans to introduce age restrictions but provided no further specifics.\nMemecoin trading has frequently been compared to gambling at a casino. But the metaphor is ill-fitting, Burwick claims, because it erases the responsibility to investors that should be borne by the platforms through which memecoins are issued.\n“This is not a casino … Retail investors are sold an opportunity to make a return on their investment, but the reality is that they have an entire system they are playing against. They don’t understand how heavily the odds are stacked against them,” says Burwick. “Pump.Fun is not gambling—it’s the illegal issuance of securities.”",

A document seen and first reported by Bloomberg indicates that the bureau has been scrambling to mitigate any potential fallout that could lead to revelations about the identities of anonymous sources connected to investigations.\nThe breached data didn't include the content of calls and texts, but Bloomberg reports that it would have shown communication logs for agents' mobile numbers and other phone numbers they used during the six months period. It is unclear how widely the stolen data has spread, if at all. WIRED reported in July that after the hackers attempted to extort AT&T, the company paid $370,000 in an attempt to have the data trove deleted. In December, US investigators charged and arrested a suspect who reportedly was behind the entity that threatened to leak the stolen data.\nThe FBI tells WIRED in a statement: “The FBI continually adapts our operational and security practices as physical and digital threats evolve. The FBI has a solemn responsibility to protect the identity and safety of confidential human sources, who provide information every day that keeps the American people safe, often at risk to themselves.”\nAT&T spokesperson Alex Byers says in a statement that the company “worked closely with law enforcement to mitigate impact to government operations” and appreciates the “thorough investigation” they conducted. “Given the increasing threat from cybercriminals and nation-state actors, we continue to increase investments in security as well as monitor and remediate our networks,” Byers adds.\nThe situation is surfacing amid ongoing revelations about a different hacking campaign perpetrated by China's Salt Typhoon espionage group, which compromised a slew of US telecoms, including AT&T. This separate situation exposed call and text logs for a smaller group of specific high-profile targets, and in some cases included recordings as well as information like location data.\nAs the US government has scrambled to respond, one recommendation from the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been for Americans to use end-to-end encrypted platforms—like Signal or WhatsApp—to communicate. Signal in particular stores almost no metadata about its customers and would not reveal which accounts have communicated with each other if it were breached. The suggestion was sound advice from a privacy perspective, but was very surprising given the US Justice Department's historic opposition to the use of end-to-end encryption. If the FBI has been grappling with the possibility that its own informants may have been exposed by a recent telecom breach, though, the about-face makes more sense.\nIf agents were following protocol for investigative communications strictly, though, the stolen AT&T call and text logs shouldn't pose a big threat, says former NSA hacker and Hunter Strategy vice president of research Jake Williams. Standard operating procedure should be designed to account for the possibility that call logs could be compromised, he says, and should require agents to communicate with sensitive sources using phone numbers that have never been linked to them or the US government. The FBI could be warning about the AT&T breach out of an abundance of caution, Williams says, or it may have discovered that agents' mistakes and protocol errors were captured in the stolen data. “This wouldn't be a counterintelligence issue unless someone was not following procedure,” he says.\nWilliams adds, too, that while the Salt Typhoon campaigns are only known to have impacted a relatively small group of people, they affected many telecoms, and the full impact of those breaches still may not be known.\n“I worry about the FBI sources who might have been affected by this AT&T exposure, but more broadly the public still doesn't have a full understanding of the fallout of the Salt Typhoon campaigns,” Williams says. “And it seems that the US government is still working on getting a grasp of that as well.”",

    "content_text": "Jonathan Lachman, the previous head of special projects at OpenAI, recently left to join a new artificial intelligence research lab founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, according to two people familiar with the discussions. It’s the most high-profile hire Murati has made since leaving OpenAI in September last year to start the much-hyped venture, which is focused on the exploration of so-called artificial general intelligence.\nMurati has poached roughly 10 researchers and engineers in total so far from competitors including OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind. Her startup is still in its early stages—it doesn’t have a name, nor a firm product direction, according to two people familiar with the company.\nMurati and Lachman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed Lachman’s departure.\nMurati departed OpenAI less than a year after CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the company’s board of directors in late 2023. In the turmoil that followed, the board briefly appointed Murati, who then served as the company’s chief technology officer, as interim CEO.\nThe move was a blow to Altman. “I was like, that feels really bad,” he told podcaster Lex Fridman last March. He described Murati’s promotion as “the low point” of the dramatic leadership crisis that briefly consumed OpenAI. Less than a week later and after more than 730 OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Altman was reinstated as CEO.\nAltman and Murati continued to work closely together at OpenAI after the incident. “She did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos,” Altman told Fridman on the podcast. When Murati stepped down from the company 10 months later, she thanked Altman in her goodbye letter.\n“There’s never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes,” she wrote in the note to OpenAI employees, which she later posted on X. She added that she was “stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.” A month later, Reuters reported that Murati was trying to raise over $100 million to fund a mysterious new company, though that figure had not been finalized.\nOpenAI’s vice president of research, Barret Zoph, and chief research officer, Bob McGrew, both left around the same time as Murati. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and chief scientist, followed suit in May of last year. He went on to found Safe Superintelligence, a startup focused on AI safety. Within three months, Sutskever’s startup had raised $1 billion. Anthropic, a major OpenAI competitor, was also founded by former OpenAI executives and has raised billions of dollars in funding, including $8 billion from Amazon.",

    "content_text": "As the rate of humanity’s data creation increases exponentially with the rise of AI, scientists have been interested in DNA as a way to store digital information. After all, DNA is nature’s way of storing data. It encodes genetic information and determines the blueprint of every living thing on earth.\nAnd DNA is at least 1,000 times more compact than solid-state hard drives. To demonstrate just how compact, researchers have previously encoded all of Shakespeare’s 154 sonnets, 52 pages of Mozart’s music, and an episode of the Netflix show “Biohackers” into tiny amounts of DNA.\nBut these were research projects or media stunts. DNA data storage isn’t exactly mainstream yet, but it might be getting closer. Now you can buy what may be the first commercially available book written in DNA. Today, Asimov Press debuted an anthology of biotechnology essays and science fiction stories encoded in strands of DNA. For $60, you can get a physical copy of the book plus the nucleic acid version—a metal capsule filled with dried DNA.\nTo encode the book in DNA, Asimov Press worked with Boston-based company Catalog, which created approximately 500,000 unique DNA molecules to encode the 240 pages in the book, representing 481,280 bytes of data.\nTraditional DNA data storage works by converting a digital file’s binary code of 0s and 1s into As, Cs, Gs, and Ts—the building blocks of DNA. Custom DNA strands are chemically synthesized letter by letter to match the desired sequence.\nCatalog instead uses a method called combinatorial assembly, which the company likens to the Gutenberg printing press. Similar to how movable letters can be arranged to form words, Catalog created an alphabet of DNA pieces that can be assembled to represent bits. The company manufactures those DNA snippets en masse and then uses enzymes to encode information into them. David Turek, Catalog’s chief technology officer, said it cost in the low thousands of dollars to encode the book in DNA and make 1,000 copies.\n“This is a case where you encode something in DNA once and you can make as many replicas as you want using the tools of molecular biology,” he says. “It’s fairly easy to do this in volume.”\nIn 2023, French company Biomemory started offering a $1,000 DNA storage card that allows customers to store roughly one kilobyte of data, equivalent to a short email, of their choosing. At the time, CEO Erfane Arwani told WIRED that the offering was an experiment to gauge consumer interest in DNA data storage. “We wanted to demonstrate that our process is ready to be shown to the world,” he said.\nThe cards were pricey, though, because synthesizing DNA is still a fairly slow and costly process. Catalog claims its combinatorial approach is more efficient. Making identical copies of the same book also drove the price down.\nAfter Catalog did the encoding, the DNA molecules were dried into a powder and shipped to France, where biological storage firm Imagene packaged the molecules into stainless steel capsules with an inert internal atmosphere, meaning there is no oxygen or moisture inside. In this state, the DNA inside can be preserved for thousands of years.\nData stored in DNA is “read” with a sequencing machine, which determines the order of those As, Cs, Gs, and Ts. San Francisco–based sequencing company Plasmidsaurus was tapped to do this decoding, and the DNA sequence is available to customers that purchase the book.\n“So often, biotechnology is hidden, kind of behind the curtains,” says Niko McCarty, founding editor of Asimov Press. He and editor-in-chief Xander Balwit conceived of the DNA book project because they “wanted people to feel biotechnology.” He says Asimov Press has sold nearly 500 preorders so far.\nThe ability to put a capsule full of DNA on a shelf or in a drawer and forget about it is a major part of its appeal as a storage medium. Turek says DNA could potentially replace sprawling, energy-guzzling data centers. Unlike storing data on servers, which requires constant energy use, DNA can sit on a shelf for years without needing energy until that data is retrieved. Of course, it means DNA isn’t the ideal medium for storing data that’s accessed often. But researchers imagine that it could be an ideal way to preserve large amounts of archival data.\n“This is going to be a technology that really attacks the energy problem quite head on,” Turek says.",

    "content_text": "Finally—after years of rumors and months of leaks, Nintendo has confirmed the biggest open secret in gaming: The Switch 2 is releasing this year.\nThe announcement doesn’t come as a surprise—especially in the wake of CES 2025, where several peripheral makers were bold enough to display replicas of the unrevealed hardware to showcase their Switch 2 accessories—but you might be shocked at just how closely the upcoming Switch 2 sticks to the form and function of its predecessor.\nAt a glance, the reveal video shows a … slightly bigger Switch. It's still a hybrid console, alternating between a portable handheld gaming device and a home entertainment system that outputs to your big-screen TV via a docking station. It still has a pair of detachable Joy-Con controllers that seem to still function as two independent controllers for the ever-present, on-the-go multiplayer. It runs Mario Kart! For all intents and purposes, this is Switch 2: Switch Harder.\nIn an industry where generational leaps are usually accompanied by the breathless espousing of new features and ever more powerful hardware, the Switch 2 reveal feels oddly restrained. Even the Sony PlayStation 5 Pro, a mid-generation upgrade, had more hype surrounding its announcement. Nintendo has rarely played that game though—arguably the last time it did was way back in the SNES era, where it boasted of the 16-bit console’s “Mode 7” graphics prowess over the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive—here in 2025, it doesn't need to. The reason is simple: The existing Switch is already a market leader, so why change what works?\nIt's hard to overstate the impact the Switch has had on the gaming industry since its launch in 2017. Not only has it become one of the best-selling consoles of all time—146.2 million units sold globally as of September 2024, putting it behind only the PlayStation 2 and the Nintendo DS handheld, though it may overtake even those by the end of its life cycle—but it's almost single-handedly driven the renewed surge in gaming handhelds.\nThe launch of Valve's Steam Deck in 2022 was the biggest reaction to the success of the Switch, and its became an immediate hit, allowing players to take their bulging (and often untouched) Steam libraries with them. Like the Switch, the Steam Deck supported docked output to a TV, either through Valve's peripheral or one made by various third-party manufacturers. From Steam Deck, we saw the arrival of rival handheld gaming PCs, from Lenovo's Legion Go to Asus’ ROG Ally X or MSI's Claw, with more on the way.\nEven Microsoft is planning some sort of handheld Xbox, which would see it entering a corner of the gaming industry it has never dabbled in, even though the company's gaming boss, Phil Spencer, says such a gadget is likely years away. Sony, meanwhile, already twice-burned with gaming handhelds in the form of the PSP and PS Vita, was so surprised by the popularity of its PS Portal device—launched as a “remote viewer” accessory for PS5—that it keeps updating it to add more dedicated gaming features (even if those ambitions aren't quite panning out just yet).\nWhile almost all of these devices have considerably more power than the now-aged Nintendo Switch, they all emerged in response to Nintendo tapping into a gamer's desire for home console-quality gaming on the go. None of them have replicated the simplicity of being able to seamlessly transition between home and portable play.\nBesides, the futility of endlessly chasing higher specs and bigger numbers is something industry figures have been quietly acknowledging since the launch of the original Switch. As far back as 2020, former Xbox marketing lead Albert Penello said hardware refreshes were “less necessary,” while Spencer told Bloomberg, “We're not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles.\"\nPower and specs be damned—everyone else is playing catch-up to the experience the Switch delivers, so why should Nintendo change what works for the Switch 2?\nSwitching It Up\nThat's not to say the Switch 2 won't offer any improvements over the Switch 1. Although Nintendo hasn't confirmed any specifications yet—don't expect those details until the dedicated Nintendo Direct broadcast on April 2—a few things are immediately apparent from the reveal.\nMost prominent is the aesthetic change—the Switch 2 is nearly all black, with only color highlights for the Joy-Con controllers. Those highlights keep the iconic red/blue split of the original Switch, but overall the new hardware has a less toylike, more grown-up appearance.\nNext are the overhauled Joy-Con controllers themselves. In addition to being slightly bigger to match the larger screen—a design choice sure to be welcomed by anyone whose hands have cramped up trying to use an existing Joy-Con as a single controller—they now snap into a recessed bracket in the main console rather than sliding into place as with the current Switch. This appears to lend credence to long-running rumors that the new controller grips would utilize a magnetic connection to hold them in place.\nOther redesigned Joy-Con elements include more prominent shoulder triggers for use when connected to the console and the addition of an inward-facing trigger that looks tricky to reach in console mode but may function independently when detached. Meanwhile, the (presumably) magnetic connection affords a raised row with integrated miniature shoulder buttons. There also seems to be some new sensor integrated here, which may prove to offer rumored mouselike features for the Joy-Cons. A couple of shots of both Joy-Cons sliding around a flat surface also point in this direction—and if so, could a Switch keyboard be far behind?\nWe also see an extra button on the face of the right-hand Joy-Con, beneath the Home button. While this is unlabeled in the teaser, it could see some form of “C-button” functionality, which Nintendo used in various forms on the N64 and GameCube in the past. It's also worth noting one particularly pointed shot focused on the left Joy-Con thumbstick rotating—could this be intended to highlight improved thumbsticks for the new generation, possibly incorporating Hall effect technology? Given the drift issues that plagued the original Switch, it'd be a smart move on Nintendo's part.\nThe biggest changes to the main console itself, beyond the increased physical size, are the addition of an extra USB-C port on the top and a new U-shaped kickstand. While the former is an excellent addition, opening up the potential to support more accessories, the latter looks a little flimsy—better than the nub that propped up the original Switch but less sturdy than the Switch OLED’s solid back-panel kickstand.\nSpeaking of the OLED Switch, and judging purely from the chunky bezel shown in the Switch 2 reveal, the new console may be reverting to an LCD panel. Again, this has been rumored for a while, but it will be hard not to see it as a bit of a step backward.\nThe best takeaway from the reveal, though, is Nintendo immediately confirming backward compatibility with existing Switch games, both physically and digitally (albeit with a few as-yet -unspecified exclusions). That's fantastic news for players who've spent the better part of a decade building up their libraries, and another example of Nintendo's quiet confidence and sense of continuity. When you've racked up 1.3 billion software sales for your incredibly successful platform, why risk alienating those customers?\nAnd that's seemingly Nintendo's strategy for Switch 2, in a nutshell: If it ain't broke, why fix it? Players love the Switch as it is, the company's main competitors are all emulating it to greater or lesser extents, and all signs point to “more but better” being a compelling selling point. It’s playing it safe—but it doesn't need to do anything else.",

The gamemaker released a two-minute teaser today with a first look at the console, a handheld that appears very similar to the original Switch but bigger.\nNintendo also announced on Thursday that it will be holding a Direct presentation to provide more details on the Switch on April 2. In the video announcement, Nintendo debuted a larger screen with a pair of black and pink and black and blue Joy-Cons. The video also appears to tease a new Mario Kart game with footage shown for just a few seconds.\nThe handheld will play both Switch 2 and Switch games, Nintendo said in a press release, but added that “certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.”\nThe original Nintendo Switch launched in 2017, at a time when Nintendo was still recovering from poor sales of its previous console, the Wii U. Where the Wii U failed to find an audience, however, the Switch soared. In 2023, it became the third best-selling console of all time behind Nintendo’s DS and the PlayStation 2, a position it still holds.\nBy 2024, however, it appeared the console had peaked. Sales were plummeting, and already rumors were spreading of a next-gen entry. Nearly a year ago, when Nintendo announced PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A would be coming to its “systems” in 2025, fans speculated that a new console was on the horizon.

So reveal January 10th,” one Reddit user joked. Another constructed a “summoning circle” full of old games and Mario and Luigi figurines.\nThe next-generation Switch will be released into a much different console ecosystem than its predecessor. In 2022, Steam released its handheld Steam Deck, which allows players to take more PC games on the go.

How are those promises to better yourself going?\nLauren Goode: I'm doing good. I'm on some new shit. That's Taylor Swift.\nMichael Calore: I just assume at this point.\nLauren Goode: It's going OK. So we've all been deep in this experiment to use AI, which is supposedly becoming more agentic to do stuff for us. So I had my own experiment with shopping over the holidays. I don't really like shopping. I wanted to offload some of it.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm excited to hear about that.\nLauren Goode: It was a journey. How about you, Zoe?\nZoë Schiffer: My experiment had to do... Well, really I was supporting my 4-month-old daughter's goal, which was to learn how to sleep through the night, and I was merely trying to support her vision for 2025 using a little assist from AI, which I will also be sharing with you guys today. Mike, what about you?\nMichael Calore: I asked Gemini on my phone for some advice on getting healthier, workout tips, menu planning, and then went a little bit deeper in civics with my requests.\nLauren Goode: I really appreciate that you both used chatbots for health reasons and I just really was in service of consumerism.\nZoë Schiffer: It can be health-related depending on how you spin it.\nLauren Goode: Sure. I was trying to declutter my brain and make space for other things.\nZoë Schiffer: I love that for you.\nLauren Goode: Thank you.\nMichael Calore: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm Zoe Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nLauren Goode: And I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: On this week's show, we are going to be sharing our experiences using AI to better our lives. We followed the advice from the chatbots in our world and we asked them to guide us through our shopping, our menu planning, our working out, and our parenting. The results were, well, we are going to talk about it. All right. So Zoe, let's start with you. Why don't you tell us what you were working on with ChatGPT as your guide?\nZoë Schiffer: Let me take you guys back a little bit to give you context on this experiment. So in 2022, when my first daughter was 4 months old, I paid a sleep expert $500 to help me sleep-train her. And I found the process pretty horrendous, because sleep training involves a ton of crying and I found it really helpful to have an expert in the room with me helping me do it and reassuring me that what I was doing wasn't creating lasting damage for my kid. So my second daughter is also around 4 months old. I'm about to start this new job at WIRED, and it felt like a good time to sleep-train her too. But when I brought up to my husband the idea of paying that same sleep expert $500 to go through the process with us again, he looked at me like I was insane. He was like, \"We paid someone the first time to tell you that you're not a bad person. We're not spending $500 on that again.\" So that is where ChatGPT comes in.\nLauren Goode: Did that person actually stay overnight with you?\nZoë Schiffer: No, no. It's a remote expert. And I honestly think part of the reason that I felt like this was a good area to experiment with AI is that the “expert” term, as far as I can tell, is a pretty loose definition. There's not an actual certification process that you go through. Anyone can technically call themselves a sleep expert. And in fact, the first person who I hired sent me a supposedly personalized plan for my daughter, and it had another kid's name in it. So it was pretty clear that it's not quite as personal as they make it seem. But basically, you tell them about your child, their schedule, and then every day you talk to them and tell them how the night went and they're like, \"Here are tips for the naps and here's when bedtime should be,\" and all of that.\nMichael Calore: So you had this dialog with ChatGPT every day?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, so at the beginning I told ChatGPT that I wanted it to take on this magical nanny personality. I wanted it to be an expert who could be an emotional support system, but also someone with a deep knowledge of child psychology who could help me use the Ferber method, which is the one where you put the kid down when they're awake and then you go in at specific intervals when they start crying, but you don't actually pick them up. You reassure them with your voice, and the intervals get a little longer as the night goes on. So it's this whole specific process and I wanted ChatGPT to walk me through it and really hold my hand throughout that process. All right, this is day one of trying to sleep-train Cleo. Let's see what ChatGPT says. “My dear Zoe, let's weave a little magic into Cleo's day. If our sweet Cleo greeted the morning sun at,”—wow, they really went hard on the magical nanny thing—“6:30 am, her first nap should be gently guided by her wakeful rhythm. Picture this.” Oh my God, this is really annoying actually.\nLauren Goode: How did you decide on ChatGPT versus the other chatbots?\nZoë Schiffer: Only because it's the one that I use all the time. It's basically replaced Google for me as a better search engine. But when I tried to shift to more agentic-like AI you've written about and talked about in the past, I felt like I did a much worse job at that. It really felt like a search engine that I was asking to become something else entirely. ChatGPT says when the clock strikes that golden nap hour, create a soothing environment, perhaps a soft lullaby or the rustle of her favorite ... Wow, I'm not into the weird affirmation thing.\nLauren Goode: Who among us doesn't want to have a nap gently guided by our wakeful rhythm?\nZoë Schiffer: It was just so much fluffy language and it was weird. So basically, I immediately identified a few problems with using AI in this way. The first one was I just didn't fully trust it. And I feel like for anything that has to do with parenting, I really wanted to have a sense of the person that I was listening to, and I wasn't sure that AI was going to give me the best advice. So I had this lingering mistrust that felt like it was a gap between fully embracing AI in this way. And the other one, which I'm curious if this came up in y'all's experiments, was that it just was completely reactive, obviously. It was all me typing into the search function and then the AI was responding to that, but at no point was it being proactive and reaching out and asking questions or anything like that. And so again, it just felt like a search engine.\nMichael Calore: Right, it was just answering prompts.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, and it didn't feel humanlike, I guess.\nLauren Goode: Did you find yourself cross-referencing at all, going online and Googling whether that was the right time anyway?\nZoë Schiffer: So this was another interesting thing, because I feel like when I use it as a search engine, I do cross-reference a lot because I'm still like, \"Oh, what if it's a hallucination?\" I want to be really, really sure. But with this, the information it was giving me was so basic, and it was about something that I know a fair amount about. So I never actually felt the need. But one other thing that I felt like was a big gap was that with an actual sleep expert, and definitely when I'm talking to my other mom friends, they'll occasionally give advice that's not the sanctioned advice that the government would give you. For example, you're not supposed to put a baby down to sleep on their tummy. But if I talk to friends of mine and say, \"Hey, Cleo's been having a really tough time. I can't tell if she's upset because her stomach's bothering her,\" friends will inevitably be like, \"Oh, have you tried flipping her over because, I know you're not supposed to, but my kid really, really likes sleeping on their tummy and it took care of all these problems, X, Y, Z.\" The chatbot, for obvious reasons, is never going to tell you to do that. And while that's a good thing, it just reiterates the basic talking points.\nMichael Calore: And you asked it to take on a persona. You asked it to develop this personality. And that adds this extra emotional layer that you don't get when you're just researching things and just searching for things online, but it doesn't take the place of an actual human being telling you what to do. And that creates probably a weird dissonance.\nZoë Schiffer: Right, exactly. And I felt like the persona it took on just felt way more like AI than just its normal persona does, because it was just adding in all this bullshit language and stuff, and I found it honestly really annoying. And so midway through the experiment, I switched to Character.ai because that allows you to create a real AI character to interact with, and I felt like maybe what I wanted was to have a little more of a human touch. And so when I used Character.ai, I gave the AI bot the name Lindsay, because that was my postpartum doula who I loved, and I said, just like the real Lindsay, I wanted it to be this British super nanny who could come in and help me be a hybrid therapist and coach. And that also had some shortcomings.\nMichael Calore: OK. Let's listen to your interactions with Character.ai.\nLauren Goode: I think you mean Lindsay.\nMichael Calore: Lindsay.\nZoë Schiffer: Hey, Lindsay. I just wanted to go over how Cleo's night went last night with you.\nCharacter.ai [archival audio]: Sure thing. How did Cleo's night go? Did she sleep a little better than the night before?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, she slept OK. I did the method on her first wake-up after midnight and for bedtime, actually. And both of those went well. She cried for five minutes and I was able to soothe her a bit. One thing that I felt was really hard was having her in the same room as me while we were trying to do this. With my last daughter, we had her in a separate room and that seemed to work better. Do you have any suggestions?\nCharacter.ai [archival audio]: It's great to hear that Cleo slept OK and that she was able to soothe herself after five minutes of crying for both nighttime and the midnight wake-up. That's a good sign. As for having her in the same room, I totally understand your concerns. It can be difficult to listen to your baby cry, and it can be even harder when they're in the same room. You can try a few things to make it easier on you. One, use a white noise machine or fan to drown out some of the crying. Two, put earplugs in to soften the sound.\nMichael Calore: I like how you basically told it that you were emotionally distressed by the fact that you wanted to be in the same room as your daughter, and then it said, \"Well, just get a white noise machine and get some earplugs and just white-knuckle through it.\"\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, so that was the other thing. I felt like it did a really bad job at the therapist role, which is interesting, because we hear all the time that people are using AI bots to be their therapists and take the place of human therapists, but I felt like she ignored my emotional concerns and she also just made mistakes. For example, I had said, \"I soothed the baby and I was able to soothe her and get her back to sleep.\" And she was like, \"Oh, it's great that she can self-soothe,\" which I was like, \"I just feel like we're missing each other here, Lindsey. I don't feel like you're listening.\"\nLauren Goode: Did this provide any comfort at all, both to you and to Cleo?\nZoë Schiffer: One thing I found is that if I had very specific questions like, \"Hey, am I allowed to pick her up if she's really, really crying,\" the AI bot would provide suggestions that were in line with the Ferber method, so that was good. I felt like if I had specific queries, the bot could answer those pretty well. But for playing the role of a sleep expert, which is more than just a search engine, I didn't feel like it did the best job.\nMichael Calore: How do you think this would've gone if this had been your first child—if you had not been through the sleep-training experience before, and you were just diving in to using AI?\nZoë Schiffer: Imagining coming in without any expertise, in some ways, I could see the AI being more helpful in that circumstance, because it really does know the Ferber method. It's pretty good at calculating the sleep intervals. Oh, they went to sleep at this time. Here's when their next nap should be. Here's when bedtime should be in. Here's how long it should last. Those are all things that the sleep experts would tell you anyway.\nMichael Calore: What was the most surprising thing that happened?\nZoë Schiffer: Well, I think that by the end of the experiment, I felt like I no longer needed the actual human expert. Even though I didn't think that the AI had done an excellent job replacing that human, it had done such a thorough job of answering all my various questions that I was like, \"I think I have a pretty good handle on this, and I can move forward on my own now.\"\nMichael Calore: So in many ways it was a good research assistant for you?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, exactly. I feel guilty even saying this, because I'm like, \"This is exactly what we worry about, of AI taking the place of an actual person's job, a female-owned sleep expert company,\" but at the same time, I wasn't going to pay anyone $500 this time around, so it was taking the place of Google, I guess.\nLauren Goode: Would you recommend this to a friend?\nZoë Schiffer: No, absolutely not, not right now. I want the future where AI is acting on our behalf in a more autonomous way. I think that sounds really helpful. It being the layer between us and the internet, that sounds compelling to me, but it really just doesn't feel like it's there yet.\nMichael Calore: OK. Well, we're going to take a quick break and when we come back, we'll talk about getting fit with Gemini, so don't go anywhere.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley.\nGemini [archival audio]: Welcome back, Mike. Hello, Lauren. Hello, Zoe.\nMichael Calore: Thanks, Gemini. So the Gemini chatbot and I got to know each other a little bit over these last few weeks.\nLauren Goode: What exactly were you using Gemini for?\nMichael Calore: I asked it for general advice about losing weight, getting fit, eating more healthily, and just healthy habits.\nLauren Goode: Did you have any knowledge gap that you were specifically looking to fill? Because I know you're already pretty healthy in how you eat, you're fit, you run. Was there something else you were looking for beyond what you already knew?\nZoë Schiffer: You're famously a vegan.\nMichael Calore: Famously a vegan, thank you.\nLauren Goode: You went to Harvard, you do triathlons.\nMichael Calore: You are right. I do generally take pretty good care of myself, and I take my health pretty seriously, but I wanted to know what it would tell me to do. Basically, I know that I should be doing more with regards to working out. I only run. I don't do any strength training. I do eat well, but also, I could probably eat better with regards to making sure that I'm not having as much sugar, not having as much alcohol, watching my intake of proteins and all of the essential amino acids and everything, the very nitty-gritty stuff about how I eat. I was hoping that it was going to give me more of that kind of advice. “Hey, Gemini, I need some help getting healthy and losing weight, and I was hoping that you could give me some general advice and some specific advice about how I can lose weight over the next month.”\nGemini [archival audio]: It's great that you're focusing on your health and weight loss goals. Here's a combination of general and specific advice to help you get started and see progress in the next month. General advice for healthy weight loss, focus on sustainable changes. Instead of quick fixes, aim for lifestyle changes you can maintain long-term. This will lead to more lasting results. Prioritize whole foods. Build your diet around nutrient-dense, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Be mindful of portions. Even healthy foods can contribute to weight gain if you eat too much.\nMichael Calore: It just keeps going. It just talks and talks and talks for three or four minutes.\nLauren Goode: Well, maybe it puts you to sleep, which is great. I guess that's what it's encouraging.\nGemini [archival audio]: Get enough sleep. Sleep is crucial for weight management as it affects hormones that regulate hunger and satiety. Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night.\nLauren Goode: And I think I know the answer to this, but why did you decide on Gemini?\nMichael Calore: Well, it's on my phone.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, the Pixel phone.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, I have a Pixel. I'm a Google person, meaning that I use Gmail and Google Calendar and Google photos and all of that, so it's baked into the experience. There are two models that you can select, and I chose the newer model for this experiment.\nLauren Goode: This podcast is sponsored by Google Gemini.\nMichael Calore: No, my life is sponsored by Google Gemini, really.\nZoë Schiffer: So how did you feel about this level of advice? Because to me, it feels general, but curious what you thought.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, this is garbage. It's basically like if you don't have the internet and you've never read any health advice on the internet, then you would not know any of this stuff, but maybe you actually would because it's so general and it's so high-level. So when it eventually stopped talking, I asked it some more specific stuff. What are some of the things that I can eat as a person who is vegan? I run somewhere around 2 1/2 to 3 miles. Is that enough cardio? I don't like to go to the gym and I don't own weights. So what can I do for strength training?\nLauren Goode: What did it tell you?\nMichael Calore: Well, what do you want to hear first? You want to hear the workouts or you want to hear the food?\nLauren Goode: Let's go with food.\nMichael Calore: What I thought was interesting is over the course of the conversation, it remembered a lot of the things that I told it. I eventually ended up telling it my age and my weight and the fact that I'm a vegan, and it remembered all of those things, and it still remembers all of those things. I talked to it last night and it remembered that.\nGemini [archival audio]: As a vegan, you'll need plant-based protein sources.\nMichael Calore: So it pointed me to legumes, lentils, chickpeas, black beans, other beans, soy products like tofu and tempeh, grains and seeds like quinoa and chia seeds and hemp seeds, nuts, vegan meats like seitan and plant-based meat alternatives, which came with a warning that it does include a lot of processed ingredients. And then it gave me general tips about making sure to combine plant-based proteins.\nZoë Schiffer: Mike's like, \"You're telling me about legumes Gemini, please.\"\nMichael Calore: I know. And that's the thing, it doesn't know that I've been a vegetarian basically since I was a teenager. So it's giving me a lot of really good advice that I can tell you as a person who's been a vegetarian since I've been a teenager, that everybody asks me, \"Well, what do you eat?\" And I have to tell them the script. And Gemini knows the script really well. So if you were new to vegetarianism or something, then it would give you a lot of really good advice, but it's not very specific about things. So I asked it for some recipes.\nLauren Goode: And what happened then?\nMichael Calore: It gave me a recipe for a tofu and peanut sauce dish that I didn't make, and then it gave me a recipe for quinoa and chickpea salad, which I did make.\nZoë Schiffer: Sounds right up your alley. And?\nMichael Calore: Well, I brought some if you want to try it, but I can tell you that it was not great.\nGemini [Archival audio]: Mediterranean quinoa salad with crispy chickpeas. This salad is packed with protein from quinoa and chickpeas, healthy fats from olive-\nZoë Schiffer: Oh my gosh. I'm so curious. Wait, it looks pretty good.\nLauren Goode: Zoe, I'm showing it to you over the Riverside recording here. Look at this.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm sad that I'm remote for this.\nLauren Goode: And we're recording around lunchtime on the West Coast, so this is perfect. Lucky listeners get to hear chewing sounds now.\nZoë Schiffer: Lauren's making a quizzical face.\nLauren Goode: Mike, I think you should give yourself a little more credit or maybe Gemini a little more credit. You know what it tastes like?\nMichael Calore: What?\nLauren Goode: It tastes like this would be in the salad bar on Google's campus.\nMichael Calore: Oh my God. I had exactly the same thought.\nLauren Goode: Not bad, actually decent, but also mass-produced and maybe with a little bit too much salad dressing to give the quinoa flavor.\nMichael Calore: OK, so it took all of my strength as a human being to not adjust the recipe while I was making it, because it just felt-\nZoë Schiffer: You're like, \"Do it for the podcast.\"\nMichael Calore: Totally. I was like, \"I have to follow this exactly.\" The only thing that I omitted is it told me to put in cherry tomatoes and the cherry tomatoes at the store looked rank, so I didn't buy them.\nLauren Goode: It's not tomato season.\nZoë Schiffer: I was going to say, \"Not in season, Gemini.”\nMichael Calore: I would've salted it very differently. I would've dressed it very differently. I also probably would not have chopped the olives because it gives it this overly salty, bitter taste.\nLauren Goode: Oh, maybe that's what it is.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. It's like a B, B+ salad in my book.\nZoë Schiffer: OK.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: I have another question because you mentioned putting in your demographic information. Did Gemini ask you for that or did you have to volunteer that?\nMichael Calore: I volunteered that. It didn't really ask me for much. It just talked and talked and talked.\nZoë Schiffer: OK, so that was something that struck me right at the beginning. I was a good health coach, and again, maybe I'm coming at this from my own perspective of wanting more of that coach figure for a lot of these things, but a good coach would ask you a bunch of questions before diving in to give you information, because you've been a vegan for a really long time. You're going to need different information than someone who's coming at this completely fresh.\nMichael Calore: I gave it the information about me and my own habits and my own health history because I wanted specifics for workouts and specifics for food intake that would fill the gaps that I needed to fill, that I felt like I needed to fill anyway, in my own practice without its help.\nLauren Goode: It sounds like it was the equivalent of a bad date. It just talked and talked and talked and didn't ask you follow-up questions.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, it didn't really ask me much at all.\nLauren Goode: Did you learn anything that you wouldn't have?\nMichael Calore: Yeah, I got a pretty good workout regimen out of it. I told it how much I run, and then I asked it, “OK, but give me a workout regimen. Give me a plan for something that I can do in my home, because I hate going to the gym and I don't like people and I don't own weights, so tell me what to do.\" And it gave me a workout regimen, which is pretty good.\nGemini [archival audio]: Key body-weight exercises, squats, stand with feet shoulder-width apart, lower your hips as if sitting in a chair, keeping your back straight and chest up. Go as low as you can comfortably.\nMichael Calore: Lunges for each leg, three sets of 10, plank, three sets holding for 30 to 60 seconds, which is torture. Glute bridges, three sets of 15 reps. And then it talks about progressive overload and it talks about rest days and all of those things, which is great. And then I was like, “OK, I do not know how to do a lunge. Can you show me how to do a lunge?\" And it presented me with a bunch of videos, five videos.\nLauren Goode: YouTube, presumably?\nMichael Calore: Yes, they were YouTube videos. Two of the links were exactly the same, but I watched all the videos and I was like, “OK, I feel like I can do a lunge now.\" And I did a lunge and I did not hurt myself, and I felt the burn. So I feel like that's pretty good.\nLauren Goode: That's pretty great, actually.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. The only thing that was weird about it is that I did a Google search and found exactly the same information from a couple of different places. And aside from the video, I do not know where Gemini got any of this information. I don't even know where it got the recipes from. It was all just presented to me as, “This is what Gemini says.”\nLauren Goode: No sourcing.\nMichael Calore: No sourcing. And I tapped through in everything, and I didn't see any good sourcing.\nLauren Goode: And presumably humans put together those workout plans or wrote about those recipes. And that was published and sorry, but your infinitesimal bits of data are being chopped up now and added to some recipe, and you have no idea where it comes from.\nMichael Calore: Julienned.\nLauren Goode: That's right.\nZoë Schiffer: OK, so are you going to stick with this? Are you going to keep using it for this purpose, or did it feel like a one-and-done experiment?\nMichael Calore: Honestly, the workout regimen, it's pretty solid. I'll keep doing it.\nLauren Goode: Nice.\nMichael Calore: And as far as the recipes go, I have so many cookbooks and so many years of experience making food for myself that I absolutely do not need to make this quinoa salad again, Lauren, unless you would like me to make it and give you some of it.\nLauren Goode: I've had other meals that you've made, and I think maybe I'd suggest those next time.\nZoë Schiffer: So diplomatic.\nMichael Calore: OK, great.\nLauren Goode: But thank you, appreciate you.\nMichael Calore: So I got to say that, for me, as a person who understands myself and understands my own needs, it was not really that big of a help. The workout was nice. I could have found that without Gemini 2.O, but if somebody who is new to this or somebody has a lot of questions, or if somebody's considering making these types of lifestyle changes, then it actually did give some pretty good advice.\nLauren Goode: Plus one for the AIs.\nMichael Calore: OK. Let's take another quick break, and then we're going to go shopping with Lauren and her chatbot friend. We'll be right back.\nLauren Goode: And her chatbot friend.\n{Break]\nMichael Calore: Get in, loser. We're going AI shopping. You're listening to Uncanny Valley. We have been talking about our week-long experiments where we took advice from our AI chatbot friends. I concentrated on health and fitness and diet. Zoe concentrated on sleep-training her newborn daughter. Now we're going to go to you, Lauren. What did you and your chatbot get into?\nLauren Goode: What did we get into? I ended up using about five different chatbots, but the goal was to streamline, I don't know what the word is … “support” my holiday shopping.\nMichael Calore: OK.\nLauren Goode: I'm not a big shopper. I don't really like it. I like purpose-driven shopping. I need a new pair of sneakers type thing. But ever since I was a teenager, really, my mom used to really like taking me shopping, and I would get overwhelmed by the overhead lights and the racks of clothes in the department stores and just thought maybe I was being a cranky teenager. And then as I got older, I realized, no, I just really didn't like that experience. And I feel that way about online now because online is just this infinite scroll of products, and I get so overwhelmed. But there were a handful of people who I really wanted to buy nice things for this holiday season. Mike, you may have been one of those test cases. And so I turned to chatbots. So the main one I used was Perplexity.\nMichael Calore: Oh, boy.\nLauren Goode: Perplexity was an interesting choice for a couple of reasons. One, I should just caveat this with, whenever these AI chatbots offer a best-of recommendation or comparison shopping, they are in a sense competing with what we do as publishers, because we have entire teams of humans who review products and try to provide a great service to people by saying these are the best products you can buy. So let's just put that out there. The second thing is that we at WIRED have written about how Perplexity is possibly plagiarizing publishers by taking parts of articles that would typically be behind paywalls and just publishing it as its own answers. So the fact that I was diving into Perplexity, and not only diving into it but paying $20 per month for Perplexity Pro, was a choice.\nZoë Schiffer: Controversial.\nLauren Goode: But Perplexity also did announce a shopping-specific feature in November, right in time for the holiday season. And I thought, \"Well, this seems like the best one to start with.\"\nMichael Calore: Nice.\nLauren Goode: So I went into Perplexity Pro, and the first person who I tried to buy for was a friend who's really into baking, but she also has a lot of baking equipment already. She's very good at it, and I wanted it to be special. So I had to find this perfect combination of she might not have it, but it's also not just something simple like a rolling pin. I felt like it wanted to be unique.\nZoë Schiffer: How much did you tell Perplexity about your friend outside of the fact that she likes to bake?\nLauren Goode: It wasn't super detailed. I think I just said exactly that. She likes to bake. She has everything. She likes nice things. I'd like to show her my appreciation.\nZoë Schiffer: Cool.\nLauren Goode: So one of the benefits of Perplexity Pro shopping is that they have developed their own Buy button. And if you use that Buy button to buy a thing, you get free shipping. So they're basically taking what people are already doing, shopping online, and they're collating it. They're creating this cascade of products you might be interested in. And then you'll either see a Buy button that's powered by Shopify, or you'll see Perplexity's own. Cool in theory. The problem was the initial list of things they recommended were just really bad.\nMichael Calore: OK, like what?\nLauren Goode: A kid's miniature baking set.\nZoë Schiffer: They're like, \"Help her connect with her inner child.\"\nLauren Goode: Which I, of course, ordered and shipped to Zoe immediately for the girls to play with. The other thing that it recommended, which was just incredibly low-brow, was a sweatshirt that said on it, \"My buns are gluten-free.\"\nZoë Schiffer: Ew. You're like, \"I said she likes the finer things. You idiot.\"\nLauren Goode: Right, but then there was this Swiss stacking bakeware thing that was in the middle of that, that I thought, \"Well, I could see that.\" But once again, that also seems like a standard thing that people who really like to bake might already have.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, yeah, totally.\nLauren Goode: So then I turned to Amazon's Rufus, which is a little chatbot built into Amazon's website. That was hilarious because I gave it a similar prompt, and it immediately recommended I buy a $400-plus KitchenAid stand mixer, which by the way, great kitchen staple to have if you're into cooking and baking, but—\nZoë Schiffer: Also a great thing to get secondhand.\nMichael Calore: The person who bakes also has that.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. And also what do they think, I have Bezos bucks?\nMichael Calore: What kind of friend is this?\nZoë Schiffer: They're like, \"Our only experience is with someone who's possibly the richest man in the world. So why don't you buy your friend a private island that she can bake on?\"\nLauren Goode: Exactly. All right, and then I went to ChatGPT.\nMichael Calore: OK.\nLauren Goode: ChatGPT was quite good.\nMichael Calore: No.\nZoë Schiffer: OK.\nLauren Goode: I think what it was best at was actually the ideation process.\nChatGPT [archival audio]: For a friend who loves baking and appreciates refined special gifts, here are some thoughtful ideas that combine luxury, personalization, and her passion.\nLauren Goode: It wasn't like, \"Here's a link, click Buy, buy here, let's make this as easy as possible for you.\" It was well, and I'm paraphrasing, it sounds like you're trying to be thoughtful, so here are some thoughtful gifts. And here's what it said.\nZoë Schiffer: One, custom heirloom recipe board, a high-quality wooden cutting board engraved with a cherished family recipe and handwritten script. Two, personalized rolling pin with unique design, curate a set of artisanal ingredients, premium Madagascar vanilla beans, saffron, exotic spices, and rare sugars.\nLauren Goode: So it not only made these recommendations, but it suggested where I should buy them. It didn't provide links immediately, but when I asked in a follow-up question, it did provide links. I ended up going with the specialty ingredients, the Madagascar vanilla and saffron, and I even bought some gold flakes and stuff like that because I was like, \"Well, that's something that someone can use.\" And the other stuff was a little schmaltzy.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: Kind of, but I don't know, they felt like pretty good suggestions. It makes sense to me that this was the most helpful one because the part of the process that you're describing at the beginning that's stressful for you isn't like, \"Oh, it's so laborious pulling out my credit card and clicking Buy.\" It's like, \"It sucks trying to think of personalized gifts for people.\" So the fact that these were hyper-specific and ones that wouldn't have been top-of-mind for me, I'm like, \"That's kind of compelling.\"\nLauren Goode: Exactly. It's not like, \"Oh, I need the Buy button just to make it 30 seconds faster.\" It was, \"I am overwhelmed by the ideation process, give me the ideas.\" And of course, I still ended up poking around the internet a bit after that, but it was like, \"Great.\" It containerized things for me. This is the thing I'm going to go for.\nMichael Calore: Also, that's the best voice.\nZoë Schiffer: I was going to say, the voice sounded really good.\nLauren Goode: That's Cole. They had these cool names like Jasper, Cole. Maybe Cole should sleep-train your baby.\nZoë Schiffer: I know.\nMichael Calore: I don't like the fake ums and ahs. We don't need that in AI voices, but Cole sounds good.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I also tried shopping for my 16-year-old niece, and that was funny because I was just picturing the withering glances I would get for something that was incredibly not cool. So I created a little sketch of her. She's a junior in high school. She really likes books. She has a pet cat who she adores. She thinks she wants to be a nurse. She's studying for SATs. And I turned to Gemini for this, and Gemini was just so uninspired. First, it did make one recommendation that was a little bit confusing. It said to get her a cat blanket. And I was like, \"I don't know if this is a blanket with cats stitched on it, or if it's a blanket that she should give to her cat,\" which everyone knows you shouldn't buy one of those because the cat ends up in a box that it loves or something.\nZoë Schiffer: You're like, \"Gemini, have you ever incurred the wrath of Gen Z? I need more creative ideas here. Come on.\"\nLauren Goode: Well, then the next thing that it recommended was getting her an SAT book.\nZoë Schiffer: Oh my God.\nLauren Goode: I just was like, \"Oh my ...\" I would totally lose my status as cool aunt if I did that. And they call me famous auntie, by the way, because they know I have a podcast and because I have a blue checkmark on some social sites, and they just think it's the coolest thing. And I'm like, \"That is so not currency guys. It's not.\"\nMichael Calore: Yeah, so you need to give them $8.\nLauren Goode: I gave them a lot more than $8. Cash and a card, this is both my niece and nephew and just that's what they got. And I think they were very pleased with that because they can buy whatever they want, and they're well beyond the age of you feeling like you want them to unwrap something, which is really fun for little kids. So Gemini, a fail at that.\nMichael Calore: So it sounds like your experiences for teens, not great. Also, the experience where it just provides you a bunch of links, not great, but if you need help ideating, if you need help coming up with fresh and interesting ideas that you would not normally have thought of, it actually works.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, it's good for brainstorming. It doesn't work yet at the level of either one, being agentic, where you just set it on its way and you wake up the next morning and the thing is ordered. Maybe that's the future. But I also think that these chatbots aren't quite sure what they're supposed to be yet in that sense. At this point, Perplexity Pro's shopping, it doesn't have the value proposition of “just come here and do all your shopping,” though it wants that. It's just dipping its toe in the water of shopping. And to them, if you're just spending slightly more time on Perplexity Pro than you are on Amazon or Google, even if you end up there eventually, goal accomplished.\nZoë Schiffer: So did the process feel less stressful for you than the typical holiday shopping experience?\nLauren Goode: Not really, no. Everything was pretty much late. I kicked some stuff down the road. I was like, \"I'll get this in the new year.\" My friend's specialty ingredient showed up after the holiday. I also did an experiment with returns, and we all know that that's one of the more onerous parts of shopping. It's cool to envision a world where eventually, if we do purchase through these chatbots, or in some ways they're tied to our past purchases, you can just type in, \"I'd like to process this return,\" and it does it for you. It knows the order number, it does it for you, maybe it even generates the label for you right there, something like that. But it doesn't do that yet. It's not even close. So basically it's not agentic. It doesn't really shop on your behalf, just good for brainstorming and it's not helping you with, I don't know what to call it, the back end of it. And so it was like a feeder service at this point in time.\nZoë Schiffer: Fair.\nLauren Goode: So I still really don't like shopping all that much, but that's OK. Sorry, Cole.\nMichael Calore: OK, so let's do a group vote. Overall, how would you rate your experience using AI as your helper to improve your lives? Zoe, what about you?\nZoë Schiffer: I give it like a B minus at this point. I want it to be great, and I feel like it's just OK.\nMichael Calore: OK. Lauren?\nLauren Goode: I give it a solid B. ChatGPT really pulls up the grade, changes the curve.\nMichael Calore: Nice.\nLauren Goode: What about you, Mike?\nMichael Calore: I'm also going to go B. I made a joke about this, but if you have the internet and you know how to search for things, then you do not need Gemini to tell you anything that it told me. But if you're curious and you like to talk to things and you really don't have any clue as to how to step into this new world, if this is all new information for you, then it was fine and it didn't give me anything that was overtly bad. Even the salad was a B.\nLauren Goode: Oh, gosh.\nMichael Calore: That's our show for today.

    "content_text": "Escaping the sickening air pollution triggered by the ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles has become a game of which algorithm to trust. After the blazes first ignited last week, residents began noticing that air quality data reported by the US government sometimes contradicted the figures displayed by Apple’s Weather app, the wildfire tracking app Watch Duty, and other tools.\nThough they all largely depend on data from the same kind of equipment to measure pollutants in the air, different apps and websites employ different formulas to transform raw readings into digestible estimates of how toxic conditions are currently and how they might change later. And a wider variety of calculations and dashboards have emerged in recent years as the effects of climate change, including more severe wildfires and pollen blooms, prompted a gush of investment from Google, small startups, and researchers into generating air quality metrics to help people anticipate and avoid dangerous conditions.\nAs a result, determining which provider to put the most stock in has become a routine source of confusion and frustration during wildfires in the US. In recent days, scouring the various services to identify a breathable spot in Los Angeles was particularly challenging because of the sheer number of fires burning across the county, which is dotted with valleys that can create pockets of poor air quality. On Monday, for example, Google’s data showed the air was safe across Los Angeles, but Watch Duty indicated it was dangerous in the neighborhoods around the Palisades Fire.\nTwo environmental researchers who study how pollution harms human health say that, in the US, the larger circles displayed on the Environmental Protection Agency’s Fire AirNow map is the data source they suggest people follow. “Everything else is a distant second,” says John Volckens, a mechanical engineering professor at Colorado State University who is traveling to Los Angeles this week to study pollution from the ongoing fires.\nThose big circles represent data from government monitoring stations that operate across the country. (There’s roughly one per every 300,000 people in the US, according to Volckens.) Los Angeles has a handful of them, and their data is tracked and published on an hourly basis by the EPA. The agency runs calculations on the readings to determine the air quality index, or AQI, which can represent current conditions and averages over the next 24 hours. The AQI, which ranges from 0 to over 300, is divided into a scale of six colors starting with green, meaning it’s safe to do activities outside, to maroon, indicating people should seal their windows and stay inside (or wear a tight-fitting N95 mask if they must venture out).\nAnother popular set of readings come from sensors developed by the Utah company PurpleAir. They are both less powerful and less accurate than the government gear but are more affordable, and anyone can buy one and install it wherever they wish. They report data every two minutes, and Los Angeles has at least hundreds of them. The company uses the sensors and its own calculations to produce what it says is a real-time map of air quality.\nAirNow’s fire map includes data from PurpleAir sensors (represented by small circles on the map), and Watch Duty, a nonprofit app for tracking fires, also displays PurpleAir data. But likely due to different calculations and processing delays, the air quality index reported by the same sensors can vary greatly from map to map. For what’s known as PM2.5 pollution, or tiny inhalable particles of smoke and dust, a PurpleAir sensor located south of Los Angeles International Airport simultaneously returned on Monday an air quality index of 28 on AirNow’s website, 20 on WatchDuty, and 5 on PurpleAir’s official page.\nEach of those values generally indicates healthy air, but things can get more complicated when other types of data are added into the calculations. That’s exactly what companies such as BreezoMeter and Ambee do in hopes of providing what they describe as accurate “hyperlocal” estimates in the many miles between some sensor locations.\nBreezoMeter was founded in Israel and raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital funding before Google acquired it in 2022 for more than $200 million, according to Israeli media. (Google declined to comment on the deal value.) It powers the air quality data seen in the Weather app on Apple devices and the Google Maps app. Indian startup Ambee, meanwhile, is responsible for air quality data in the app WeatherBug, which is among the most popular weather apps in the world.\nYael Maguire, vice president of geo sustainability at Google, says BreezoMeter estimates air quality on an hourly basis across a broad range of pollutants and locations, generating more data than many government systems. To make its calculations, the company uses information gleaned not only from the EPA and PurpleAir sensors, but also satellites and other sources such as weather and traffic reports. Similar data are incorporated into Ambee’s proprietary algorithm, according to its CEO, Jaideep Singh Bachher. “We want to give people the right data whenever, wherever they need,” he says.\nVolckens says he doesn’t trust these systems. The low-cost PurpleAir sensors they partly draw upon aren’t well suited for the conditions where they’re often deployed in the US, including during wildfires, he says. But he acknowledges that while they tend to be off in terms of the raw numbers, these sensors can be accurate about 90 percent of the time in determining the advisory level—that green-to-maroon scale that often is enough for people to make decisions about how to protect their health.\nAndrew White, a representative for PurpleAir, says its sensors have been found to be precise and that it isn’t in control of how other services run calculations using its data. Google’s Maguire says the company “provides industry-leading, highly accurate air quality information,” including “even in areas with limited monitoring.”\nJennifer Richmond-Bryant, an associate professor of forestry and environmental resources at North Carolina State University who has studied PurpleAir sensors, says the safest bet for anyone concerned about air quality is to trust the highest number or color level among different services. “I have more faith in the AirNow numbers because I understand them,” she says. But “it can never hurt to make an overly conservative decision when it comes to protecting yourself.”\nIn countries with insufficient government monitoring, startups are filling an important void. BreezoMeter and Ambee were founded by people worried about their families’ exposure to harmful air particles at home in Israel and India, respectively. BreezoMeter offers data on more than 40 countries, and Ambee over 100.\nThat breadth of coverage also makes their services attractive to Apple and other global companies that want to incorporate air data, which includes pollen forecasts, into apps, product testing, or marketing campaigns. Breezometer’s clients include companies in the automotive, health and fitness, and beauty industries. Ambee’s include healthcare businesses such as Sanofi, which makes Allegra allergy pills and last year launched a tool to find walking and biking routes with the cleanest air.\nBreezoMeter has shed some of its staff under Google, though Maguire says the company is committed to providing reliable air data. As demand for air quality data blooms, researchers are racing to improve the output of low-cost sensors and advocating for the installation of different kinds of monitoring gear, like more pollen counting stations. What’s not hazy these days is that the air is getting worse, Volkens says, and we’re behind on measuring it well.",

    "content_text": "At least as of this writing, we’re still awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court on TikTok’s future, but the app’s users aren’t waiting around to find out what happens.\nOver the last few days, TikTok alternatives like Clapper, Flip, and TikTok’s own Lemon8 have risen to the top of the app store charts. The most popular of them all, Xiaohongshu, has made the biggest impression on its over 700,000 new users.\nThe exodus—which was prompted by the ban attempt and carried out through sheer spite—proves how pointless the effort to protect Americans from a “dangerous” app, which has taken more than five years, has truly been. In fact, the effort has seemingly made things worse for those in power.\nLet’s discuss!\nJust Desserts!\nOver and over again, the US government has said that its main goal in banning TikTok has always been to shield American users from Chinese propaganda and protect their data.\nI think it’s fair to say that, unsurprisingly, the government messed up. Big time.\nIn just a few short days, Xiaohongshu—meaning “Little Red Book” in English—has flipped US-China relations on its head. The app was founded in 2013 and acts as something like a Chinese version of Instagram. Not only are Americans consuming videos and images on an app that actively censors content related to Tiananmen Square and shows nothing when searching for “Xi Jinping,” but they’re vengefully agreeing for the app to track their data. Just all around, the opposite outcome from what the US intelligence community desired.\nMany Americans are also giving advice on how to better integrate with Xiaohongshu’s predominantly Chinese user base. One TikTok user posted a video this week asking new American users to “stop saying democracy” on the app. “If you’re Taiwanese,” she said, “and you’re on Xiaohongshu, you are now Chinese. Sorry.” I couldn’t find a single piece of criticism in her comment section. In fact, many users were thanking her for the tips.\nIf anything, the attempt to ban TikTok has inspired more interest in China among Americans than anything else. There’s been a huge influx of TikTok users learning Mandarin by chatting with Chinese Xiaohongshu users or downloading language learning apps like Duolingo.\n“Started learning in Duolingo and from creators on Red Note [or Xiaohongshu],” one TikTok user wrote to me. “Even added the Chinese keyboard option on my phone.”\n“Downloaded Red Note and had my first Duolingo Chinese lesson this morning 😂,” said another.\n“oh so NOW you’re learning mandarin,” the X account for Duolingo posted on Tuesday responding to the growth in interest.\nThere’s been a 216 percent increase in new Duolingo users signing up to learn Chinese, Duolingo spokesperson Monica Earle tells WIRED. When someone signs up for a Duolingo account, they’re asked to fill in a survey explaining how they found the app, and the company has observed “a corresponding spike” in users selecting “TikTok” as the reason they’ve joined Duolingo.\n“This is a much bigger increase than other languages,” says Earle. “For example, Spanish, one of our most popular languages to learn in the US, grew 40 percent over the same time period.”\nThousands of Americans would apparently rather join an app they can barely use than hop over to something more frictionless like Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts. “I would rather stare at a language I can't understand than to ever use a social media [platform] that Mark Zuckerberg owns,” a TikTok user said in a video my colleague Zeyi Yang included in his most recent report about the app.\nNeither the government nor Silicon Valley tech companies have done a good job of earning the trust of TikTok users, either. While lobbying for TikTok’s demise, lawmakers and intelligence officials basically asked for TikTokkers to take them at their word that the app was dangerous without providing much public evidence to back up their claim. (It’s especially rich given that data that not long ago would have been unavailable to the world’s most powerful spy services is now freely available to anyone with a credit card.) Last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg rolled out a complete reversal on hate speech protections, which likely didn’t help in winning disaffected users over to his platforms. On Xiaohongshu, the primary sentiment among new American users is that the app’s users are overwhelmingly friendly and welcoming.\nI don’t think Xiaohongshu will ever fully replace TikTok, but more importantly, it is sending a message. Even if the Supreme Court decides to uphold the ban, the government will not have met its goal of quarantining US users from Chinese influence. The multiyear project will have been an abject failure.\nThe Chatroom\nMany of you responded to last week’s question about Meta’s changes to its hate speech policies. There were a handful of readers who deactivated their Facebook accounts (one dating back to 2008) once Zuckerberg announced the updates.\nBut Jerry’s email pretty much sums up all of your responses:\n“I am a white guy, 72 years old, and really don't care what latex corrupted dildos say about me. But to give carte blanche to basement stooges and Trumpster haters to harass, hate and incite violence against the powerless just tells me how far that coward Zuckerberg has crawled up Trump’s ass.”\nThis week, I want to know what your plans are if TikTok is banned.

Big time.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In just a few short days, Xiaohongshu—meaning “Little Red Book” in English—has flipped US-China relations on its head. The app was founded in 2013 and acts as something like a Chinese version of Instagram. Not only are Americans consuming videos and images on an app that actively censors content related to Tiananmen Square and shows nothing when searching for “Xi Jinping,” but they’re vengefully agreeing for the app to track their data.

    "content_text": "America’s outgoing cyber ambassador has a warning for his successors in the incoming Trump administration: Stay engaged with tech and digital security debates on the world stage, because otherwise, Russia and China will fill the void.\n“An increasingly isolationist United States creates or amplifies a lot of problems that we're not going to be able to turn our backs on,” says Nathaniel Fick, who has spent almost two and a half years as the US’s first ambassador at large for cyberspace and digital policy. “We may not be interested in the world, but the world is interested in us.”\nThe warning from Fick comes as foreign diplomats and cybersecurity experts nervously await indications of how Donald Trump’s second administration, stocked with “America First” conservatives, will handle issues such as foreign aid, digital security norms, and the tech competition with authoritarian nations.\nSpeaking to WIRED a few days before he’s set to step down from his post—one that still lacks a Trump nominee—Fick says he’s proud of the work that his relatively new State Department bureau has done and hopeful that Trump’s team will see the value in building on that legacy.\nStaying in the Game\nThe Biden administration has spent years trying to convince “middle ground” countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to embrace the Western approach to technology and cybersecurity over China’s and Russia’s authoritarian visions. But it’s an open question whether Trump—who has disdained international institutions and insulted a host of foreign countries—will continue this diplomatic campaign.\nTo Fick, the persuasion strategy is a no-brainer, because it’s on the cusp of bearing real fruit. He’s confident that more and more countries investing in cutting-edge technology like 5G wireless networks will ultimately pick Western vendors over Chinese businesses, for two big reasons: the privacy and security risks of hiring companies that are subservient to China’s authoritarian regime and the lure of foreign direct investment (FDI) by Western governments looking for new supply chains free of untrustworthy electronics.\n“Every country in the world is competing for this FDI by big global technology businesses, or tech-enabled businesses, and countries are going to be able to carve out an advantaged position for themselves if they're using trusted technology,” Fick says. “I think that's an argument that this next team is going to be all over.”\nOne of the strategic shifts that Fick oversaw involved knitting together US campaigns to promote Western 5G vendors and to spur the construction of new undersea internet cables. “We need to think about the full tech ecosystem,” he says.\nTwo examples show the opportunities in this area. In Costa Rica, US support after devastating Russian cyberattacks helped convince San José to become a regional leader in promoting Western 5G technology, making it a hub of foreign supply-chain investment. And last month, the tiny South Pacific island nation of Tuvalu broke ground on its first undersea cable, financed by the US and Western allies. In Tuvalu, Fick says, “we preempted a generational buildout of fundamentally untrusted [Chinese] architecture.”\nFick sees a chance for Trump’s administration to focus on these kinds of investments, with the strategy mirroring military-equipment sales to foreign governments, where diplomats arrange deals that improve partners’ security and benefit US businesses. “These are things that I've talked to the next team about,” he says.\nA Delicate Dance\nAs China has become America’s preeminent cyber adversary, burrowing deep into infrastructure like water facilities, power plants, and telecom networks, experts have wondered—and worried—about the consequences of Trump’s bombastic approach to countering Beijing.\n“Societies like ours are more vulnerable because we're more open and we're more connected,” Fick warns. “The next team is going to have to be highly sensitive to our vulnerabilities in those areas.”\nFick has discussed China’s cyber aggression with Trump’s team and predicts “some consistency on this front,” including “a shared sense that we need to extend deterrence into the digital world.” Mike Waltz, Trump’s incoming national security adviser, recently called for a cyber version of mutually assured destruction. “If you’re putting cyber time bombs in our ports and grid,” Waltz warned China, “we can do it to you, too, so let’s both not.”\nImposing costs on China is imperative, Fick says—including, “if necessary, military costs.” But as Trump embraces the madman theory of international relations, Fick worries that China, too, is becoming increasingly reckless.\n“We fear that they are mis-pricing the risk associated with” infrastructure intrusions, says Fick, who has been deeply involved in the US response to the attacks.\nUS officials are also concerned that Beijing isn’t in full control of its hacker teams. “We’re concerned that their system is not acting in a coordinated, unified way,” Fick says. “We really need the Chinese to ensure that the cyber actors on their side are operating fully within the authority and under the control of senior political leadership.”\nBracing for Change\nTrump’s election has inspired a wave of concern about the future of US tech and cyber diplomacy, given the president-elect’s views on emerging technology issues and his controversial foreign ties.\nThe Biden administration, for example, launched a global effort to crack down on commercial spyware that authoritarian regimes have used to suppress dissent. But Trump has close relationships with the countries fueling the spyware industry, including major customers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and major exporter Israel.\nFick sounds uncertain about the spyware crackdown’s future, though he says Trump’s team includes “some very strong advocates for human rights online and digital freedom” and hopes “those voices will carry the day.”\nBiden has also tried to marshal global support for restrictions on AI to prevent both existential and everyday harms. Trump is unlikely to back similar AI safety regulations, but Fick argues that Biden’s team “staked out a strong pro-innovation, pro-American position here that I would urge the next team to continue.”\nIn his global travels since Trump’s election, Fick has heard from foreign counterparts who are deeply concerned about the future of US tech and cyber diplomacy.\nEuropean governments wonder if Trump will continue US support of Ukraine and NATO in a conflict with Russia that has partly played out in cyberspace. Fick’s team was instrumental in establishing a process for rapidly delivering cyber-defense aid to Ukraine’s battered government.\n“I was in Ukraine right before Christmas, I was in Poland, I was in Estonia, kind of up and down NATO's eastern flank,” he says, adding that he sensed “both a deep desire for the United States to stay engaged and a recognition that European partners are going to need to do their share—which they, by the way, increasingly are doing.”\nMore broadly, Fick has heard “a strong desire among many allies and partners” for the US to continue going toe to toe with China and Russia in tech and cyber discussions in international bodies like the UN and the Group of 20.\n“Without the United States deeply involved, you're going to see the Chinese more deeply involved, you're going to see the Russians more deeply involved,” Fick says. “There's a pretty broad view [globally] that the US needs to, for its own interests and for the interests of our allies and partners, stay engaged in multilateral organizations.”\nFick sympathizes with Republicans who consider these multilateral organizations too slow and timid, but he wants Trump’s team to “recognize that the alternative is not diminished influence of these organizations; the alternative is simply that they become playgrounds for our competitors and our adversaries.”\nCelebrating “a Sea Change”\nLooking back on his time as America’s cyber ambassador—which saw him spend a total of more than 200 days traveling the world on nearly 80 trips to visit key US allies and partners—Fick is proud of how his team launched an entirely new bureau inside the State Department, grew it to around 130 employees, and delivered results that he says are transforming digital diplomacy.\nOne of his biggest accomplishments was the launch of a foreign cyber aid fund that will support programs to deploy security assistance to hack-stricken allies, subsidize new undersea cables, and train foreign diplomats on cyber issues.\nThe security-assistance project saw an early test in November when Costa Rica faced another major ransomware attack. “We had people on a plane the next morning, Thanksgiving morning, with hands on keyboards alongside Costa Rican partners that night,” Fick says. “That’s amazing. That is a sea change in how we do this, and it’s going to strengthen our hand in providing support to these middle-ground states.”\nFick has also focused on preparing the Foreign Service for the modern world, meeting his goal of training at least one tech-savvy diplomat for every foreign embassy (around 237 total) and successfully lobbying to add digital fluency to the State Department’s criteria for career ambassador positions. He has also helped State counterbalance the Pentagon in White House discussions about foreign tech issues—putting “American diplomacy literally back at the table in the Situation Room on technology topics.”\nAnd then there’s his team’s support for US cyber aid to Ukraine, from security software to satellite communications to cloud migration for vital government data—work that he says offers a template for future public-private foreign-aid partnerships.\nOne Final Warning\nFick has shared his thoughts about China, 5G, AI, deterrence, and other cyber issues with Trump’s transition team, and he says there’s still more to do to keep cyber diplomacy “front and center” at State. But as he prepares to leave government, he has one major piece of advice for the incoming administration.\n“It is essential to have a bias for action,” he says. “We end up admiring a problem for too long rather than taking a decisive step to address it … That decisive step may be imperfect, but indecision is a decision, and the world moves on without you.”\nPut another way: In an era of rapidly evolving technologies and intensifying geopolitical competition, massive bureaucracies like the State Department sometimes need to be jolted into action.\n“The job of the leaders in these big organizations,” Fick says, “is to move the org to change a little bit faster than it would on its own.”",

    "content_text": "In late November, a deepfake porn maker claiming to be based in the US uploaded a sexually explicit video to the world’s largest site for pornographic deepfakes, featuring TikTok influencer Charli D’Amelio’s face superimposed onto a porn performer’s body. Despite the influencer presumably playing no role in the video’s production, it was viewed more than 8,200 times and captured the attention of other deepfake fans.\n“So nice! What program did you use for creating the deepfake??” one user going by the name balascool commented. “I love charli.” D’Amelio’s agent did not reply to a request for comment.\nThe video’s creator, “DeepWorld23,” has claimed in the comments that the program was a deepfake model hosted on developer platform GitHub. This program was “starred” by 46,300 other users before being disabled in August 2024 after the platform introduced rules banning projects for synthetically creating nonconsensual sexual images, aka deepfake porn. It became available again in November 2024 in an archived format, where users can still access the code.\nGitHub’s crackdown is incomplete, as the code—along with others taken down by the developer site—also persists in other repositories on the platform. A WIRED investigation has found more than a dozen GitHub projects linked to deepfake “porn” videos evading detection, extending access to code used for intimate image abuse and highlighting blind spots in the platform’s moderation efforts. WIRED is not naming the projects or websites to avoid amplifying the abuse.\n“It’s not easy to always remove something the moment it comes online,” says Henry Ajder, an AI adviser to tech companies like Meta and Adobe on the challenge of moderating open source material online. “At the same time, there were red flags that were pretty clear.”\nImplemented in June 2024, GitHub’s policy bans projects that are “designed for, encourage, promote, support, or suggest in any way the use of synthetic or manipulated media for the creation of nonconsensual intimate imagery or any content that would constitute misinformation or disinformation.”\nGitHub has disabled at least three repositories identified by WIRED in December 2024 and is clearly taking action on abusive code. But others have popped up elsewhere on the platform, including some with near-identical branding or clear descriptors as “NSFW,” “unlocked” versions, or “bypasses.”\n“We condemn using GitHub to post sexually obscene content and prohibit such conduct in our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policies,“ says Jesse Geraci, online safety counsel at GitHub. “GitHub conducts proactive screening for such content, in addition to actively investigating abuse reports, and we quickly take action where content violates our terms.”\nOne project identified by WIRED in December 2024 had branding almost identical to a major project—self-described as the “leading software for creating deepfakes”—which GitHub disabled for several months last year for violating its terms of service. GitHub has also since disabled this additional version.\n“It wasn’t hiding,” says Ajder. “It wasn’t particularly subtle.”\nHowever, an archived version of the major repository is still available, and at least six other repositories based on the model were present on GitHub as of January 10, including another branded almost identically.\nAll of the GitHub projects found by WIRED were at least partially built on code linked to videos on the deepfake porn streaming site. The repositories exist as part of a web of open source software across the web that can be used to make deepfake porn but by its open nature cannot be gate-kept. GitHub repos can be copied, known as a “fork,” and from there tailored freely by developers.\n“When we look at intimate image abuse, the vast majority of tools and weaponized use have come from the open source space,” says Ajder. But they often start with well-meaning developers, he says. “Someone creates something they think is interesting or cool and someone with bad intentions recognizes its malicious potential and weaponizes it.”\nSome, like the repository disabled in August, have purpose-built communities around them for explicit uses. The model positioned itself as a tool for deepfake porn, claims Ajder, becoming a “funnel” for abuse, which predominantly targets women.\nOther videos uploaded to the porn-streaming site by an account crediting AI models downloaded from GitHub featured the faces of popular deepfake targets, celebrities Emma Watson, Taylor Swift, and Anya Taylor-Joy, as well as other less famous but very much real women, superimposed into sexual situations.\nThe creators freely described the tools they used, including two scrubbed by GitHub but whose code survives in other existing repositories.\nPerpetrators on the prowl for deepfakes congregate in many places online, including in covert community forums on Discord and in plain sight on Reddit, compounding deepfake prevention attempts. One Redditor offered their services using the archived repository’s software on September 29. “Could someone do my cousin,” another asked.\nTorrents of the main repository banned by GitHub in August are also available in other corners of the web, showing how difficult it is to police open-source deepfake software across the board. Other deepfake porn tools, such as the app DeepNude, have been similarly taken down before new versions popped up.\n“There’s so many models, so many different forks in the models, so many different versions, it can be difficult to track down all of them,” says Elizabeth Seger, director of digital policy at cross-party UK think tank Demos. “Once a model is made open source publicly available for download, there’s no way to do a public rollback of that,” she adds.\nOne deepfake porn creator with 13 manipulated explicit videos of female celebrities credited one prominent GitHub repository marketed as a “NSFW” version of another project encouraging responsible use and explicitly asking users not to use it for nudity. “Learning all available Face Swap AI from GitHUB, not using online services,” their profile on the tube site says, brazenly.\nGitHub had already disabled this NSFW version when WIRED identified the deepfake videos. But other repositories branded as “unlocked” versions of the model were available on the platform on January 10, including one with 2,500 “stars.”\n“It is technically true that once [a model is] out there it can’t be reversed. But we can still make it harder for people to access,” says Seger.\nIf left unchecked, she adds, the potential for harm of deepfake “porn” is not just psychological. Its knock-on effects include intimidation and manipulation of women, minorities, and politicians, as has been seen with political deepfakes affecting female politicians globally.\nBut it’s not too late to get the problem under control, and platforms like GitHub have options, says Seger, including intervening at the point of upload. “If you put a model on GitHub and GitHub said no, and all hosting platforms said no, for a normal person it becomes harder to get that model.”\nReining in deepfake porn made with open source models also relies on policymakers, tech companies, developers and, of course, creators of abusive content themselves.\nAt least 30 US states also have some legislation addressing deepfake porn, including bans, according to nonprofit Public Citizen’s legislation tracker, though definitions and policies are disparate, and some laws cover only minors. Deepfake creators in the UK will also soon feel the force of the law after the government announced criminalizing the creation of sexually explicit deepfakes, as well as the sharing of them, on January 7.\nUpdate 1/21/25 9:40 am EST: This story has been updated to include a comment from GitHub.",

The repositories exist as part of a web of open source software across the web that can be used to make deepfake porn but by its open nature cannot be gate-kept. GitHub repos can be copied, known as a “fork,” and from there tailored freely by developers.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“When we look at intimate image abuse, the vast majority of tools and weaponized use have come from the open source space,” says Ajder.

One Redditor offered their services using the archived repository’s software on September 29. “Could someone do my cousin,” another asked.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Torrents of the main repository banned by GitHub in August are also available in other corners of the web, showing how difficult it is to police <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/dark-side-open-source-ai-image-generators/\">open-source deepfake software</a> across the board.

    "content_text": "The following is adapted from Gambling Man, my new biography of Masayoshi Son. As the Japanese founder and CEO of SoftBank, “Masa”—as he is known to friends and rivals alike—is probably the most powerful mogul of the 21st century who is not a household name. He was born in 1957 and grew up on the western island of Kyushu. Barely 5'5\", invariably dressed smart-casual, he lived for several years in California. Though his charm is legendary, he is easily bored. Visitors to his cavernous office in Tokyo, with its Putin-sized long table, can be given five minutes or two hours.\nMasa has been a software distributor, a dotcom investor, and a broadband and mobile phone operator. Now, through the SoftBank Vision Fund, he is the world’s largest venture investor. In the past two decades, he has invested in or controlled assets worth $1 trillion. This past December, he met with Donald Trump and pledged to invest $100 billion in the US.\nThere are a lot of stories about Masa (some told for the first time in the book): how he bankrolled Alibaba, China’s internet colossus, after a six-minute speed-dating session with Jack Ma; how he personally supersized hundreds of Silicon Valley startups; how he recruited ex-Googler Nikesh Arora with a $320 million remuneration package signed on a napkin. But my favorite might be this: how Masa plotted with Steve Jobs to take the iPhone global.\nAt the turn of the 21st century, Masa was the richest man in the world—for three days. After the dotcom crash, he lost 97 percent of his wealth. But he never abandoned his techno-optimism, launching a new broadband service in Japan under the Yahoo brand. His dream was to connect a mobile-phone operator to Yahoo broadband. That way, Japanese consumers could access data, images, and messages all on one digital device. The missing piece was a breakthrough consumer product to compete with his archrival, NTT Docomo, the dominant incumbent in Japan and the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. The man who supplied the answer was his old friend Steve Jobs.\nThe relationship between Masa and Jobs was a special one. Both were autocratic mavericks who possessed buckets of self-belief and an uncanny ability to anticipate the future. Both had a deep understanding of aesthetics, technology, and consumer behavior. Masa’s office in Tokyo once had 50 different telephone handsets mounted on a wall, allowing him to study each feature before deciding on SoftBank’s own product design. Masa loved to quote Jobs’ famous line from Apple’s 1997 Think Different advertising campaign: “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”\nMasa first encountered Steve Jobs in the mid-1980s at the annual Comdex trade fair in Las Vegas. Sometime in the summer of 1998, they had their first serious conversation under a cherry tree at the Woodside, California, home of Larry Ellison, boss of the Oracle software group and a fellow Japanophile.\nEllison’s home was in fact more like a village, a compound of intricately fashioned wooden houses modeled after a Japanese emperor’s palace. The 23-acre estate took almost a decade to design and build, including a lake and a waterfall operated by an on-off switch. All the buildings were constructed without nails and had mud-plastered walls designed to withstand a 7.3 Richter-scale earthquake. In total, Ellison’s homage to Japanese culture and history was worth around $70 million.\nThe talk around the table that day was about crazy internet valuations in the stock market. But Masa and Jobs were more interested in what would happen after the dotcom bubble. “I said that I was focused on the internet—and he agreed the internet was the future,” Masa says. Both men grasped that a paradigm shift was coming. Movements in the Nasdaq were one thing; the advent of the networked world, in which Apple played a leading role as innovator and SoftBank the part of investor and operator, was quite another.\nApple was, by then, one of the world’s most valuable companies, with a suite of smash-hit products from Mac laptops to the iPod. Like Masa, Jobs was paranoid about rivals stealing his ideas. No Apple project was more top secret than the iPhone, the touchscreen smartphone that would sell billions and revolutionize personal communications.\nBy Masa’s account, on a visit to California, sometime in the summer of 2005, he showed Jobs his own sketch of a mobile-enabled iPod that had a large display and used the Apple operating system. The new device, he predicted, would be able to process data and images. Jobs pooh-poohed the idea but could not resist dropping hints about the iPhone.\nJobs: “Masa, don’t give me your shitty drawing. I have my own.”\nMasa: “Well, I don’t need to give you my dirty piece of paper, but once you have your product, give it to me for Japan.”\nJobs refused to reveal any more detail, but Masa spotted the flicker of a smile on the Apple boss’s face. After pressing him further, Masa wangled a follow-up meeting at Jobs’ Tudor-style country home in Palo Alto. At that meeting, Masa claims, Jobs agreed in principle to give SoftBank exclusive rights to distribute the iPhone in Japan. “Well, Masa, you are crazy,” said Jobs. “We have not talked to anybody, but you came to see me first. I’ll give it to you.”\nNothing was written down. There was no discussion of price or volume. Just a gentleman’s agreement, based on the assumption that Masa would have the financial wherewithal to build or acquire a mobile phone business. “It was super confidential. I never saw the product before it arrived in Japan [in 2008],” Masa claims. “Steve never even told me the name.”\nThe tale has a mythical quality. It assumes Jobs gave his word a full three years before Apple launched the iPhone in Japan. Yet that very promise may well have given Masa the confidence to buy Vodafone Japan, the British-owned “also-ran” that used football icon David Beckham in its marketing campaign. This was a highly leveraged deal—the biggest to date in Asia—but Masa gambled that he had a game-changing product in the pipeline. Whatever the precise chronology, Masa pulled off the distribution deal of the century, which enabled him to build a profitable consumer business in Japan, massively enhancing the SoftBank brand.\nOn March 17, 2006, Masa clinched his $17 billion deal to buy Vodafone Japan. Two weeks later, Jobs flew to Tokyo, where Masa challenged the Apple boss to uphold his end of the deal. “You didn’t give me anything in writing, but I made a $17 billion bet based on your word,” he said. “You had better feel a tiny bit of responsibility.” Jobs laughed and said, “Masa, you are a crazy guy. We will do what we discussed.”\nIn the spring of 2006 Masa was in an almighty hurry. Mobile phone users in Japan would soon be free to transfer their telephone numbers to rival operators. Unless SoftBank came out with a compelling new offer on price or product, it risked losing hundreds of thousands of customers to NTT Docomo and the number-two operator, KDDI.\nSteve Jobs was also racing against the clock. Three years earlier, he was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer, but he’d delayed opening his body for surgery, and the cancer had spread to his liver. From the day of his operation in October 2004, he knew he was living on borrowed time. In public, he insisted to colleagues and investors he was cured. In private, he was more focused than ever, devoting every hour to two secret projects, the iPhone and a new tablet computer called the iPad.\nApple launched its first iPhone, with low-capacity 2G technology, in the US in the summer of 2007. The device was incompatible with the more advanced technologies being used in Japan. For that reason, Japanese telecom giants saw Apple more as a designer and manufacturer of personal computers and music players. They couldn’t imagine the Americans producing a game-changing new consumer product in their space. By contrast, Masa grasped that Steve Jobs was about to become the disruptor-in-chief as faster technologies became ascendant not just in Japan but around the world.\nIn November 2007, the boss of AT&T, distributor of Apple’s 2G iPhone in the US, gave the game away. Speaking at the Churchill Club, a business event in Silicon Valley, Randall Stephenson let slip that Apple’s next iPhone would be 3G compatible. From then on, even as more than 2 million American consumers enjoyed a groundbreaking experience on a brilliant screen with a flick of their finger, the industry was abuzz with rumors of Apple’s next-generation product.\nWithin weeks, NTT Docomo’s CEO, Masao Nakamura, held talks with Jobs at Apple’s Cupertino headquarters, followed by Masa himself. This suggests that the exclusive iPhone distribution deal may not have been as watertight as Masa thought, though he later claimed that he was in regular touch with Jobs, exchanging ideas on features for the new iPhone. “I created all the characters, the emoticons that went in the iPhone,” he says. “I gave him many ideas.”\n(The claim is breathtaking, but Masa has always had an artistic bent. He is a decent amateur painter in the early Impressionist style. He also has a fine grasp of consumer behavior. How far Jobs listened to his Japanese friend is another matter.)\nBoth Masa and Docomo were desperate to get their hands on the new 3G-enabled product that was tri-band, operating on multiple networks and therefore capable of being rolled out all over the world. Docomo’s mobile phones operated on a 2-GHz network in Japan’s cities. Once in the countryside, where mobile phone towers were less prevalent, mobile users would flip to a more reliable “platinum band” 800‑MHz service. There was one drawback: NTT’s dual-band network had to be tested thoroughly to ensure the switch-over worked smoothly. The risk of a delayed iPhone rollout was therefore serious.\nBecause risk-averse Japanese regulators favored incumbents, SoftBank had to settle for the inferior 2.1-GHz spectrum, whose advantage was that it was single-band and nationwide, and therefore did not require a switchover.\nTechnology mattered, but personal chemistry counted even more. “There was a deep connection between Masa and Steve Jobs,” says Ron Fisher, SoftBank’s man in the US, who attended several meetings between the two men. “Jobs understood that when you are trying to change consumer behavior in a place like Japan, you need a maverick.”\nOn June 4, 2008, Masa announced that SoftBank would sell the iPhone, confirming he had beaten Docomo to the punch. The following month, SoftBank began distribution in Japan. By September 2011, when SoftBank lost its exclusivity over the iPhone, its market share had grown to 23 percent, up from 17 percent at the point when the mobile business was acquired from Vodafone. Steve Jobs’ decision to stake all on SoftBank was vindicated, but the success also pointed to Masa’s ability to scale up rapidly, overcoming a maze of logistical, regulatory, and marketing obstacles.\nThanks to the iPhone, Masa established SoftBank Mobile as the number one operator in Japan. This was the springboard for his acquisition of a controlling stake in Sprint in 2013, which later merged with T-Mobile, creating a third force in the US telecoms market. Along the way, he reverted from mobile operator to global tech investor. He snapped up Arm Holdings, the UK-based advanced chip designer, and tried to merge it with Nvidia, now the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia founder Jensen Huang remains a good friend and likes to remind Masa that he sold his 5 percent stake in 2019, missing out on an Alibaba-sized deal of a lifetime.\nMasa’s passion now is artificial general intelligence, whose impact, he believes, will exceed the microchip, the internet, and the mobile phone. “I have to be in this revolution,” he told me in our last interview in Tokyo. “I have to participate.”\nIn the summer of 2024, SoftBank invested $500 million in OpenAI. Before that, the Financial Times suggested that Masa was ready to put up $1 billion to develop “the iPhone of artificial intelligence” in partnership with Sam Altman and Jony Ive. This would be the first consumer device in the age of AI. If the vision comes off—and never write off Masayoshi Son—it would be a fitting legacy to his friendship and collaboration with his mentor-collaborator Steve Jobs.\nCopyright © 2025 by Lionel Barber.

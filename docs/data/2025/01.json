    "content_text": "Elon Musk’s minions—from trusted sidekicks to random college students and former Musk company interns—have taken over the General Services Administration, a critical government agency that manages federal offices and technology. Already, the team is attempting to use White House security credentials to gain unusual access to GSA tech, deploying a suite of new AI software, and recreating the office in X’s image, according to leaked documents obtained by WIRED.\nSome of the same people who helped Musk take over Twitter more than two years ago are now registered as official GSA employees. Nicole Hollander, who slept in Twitter HQ as an unofficial member of Musk’s transition team, has high-level agency access and an official government email address, according to documents viewed by WIRED. Hollander’s husband, Steve Davis, also slept in the office. He has now taken on a leading role in Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Thomas Shedd, the recently installed director of the Technology Transformation Services within GSA, worked as a software engineer at Tesla for eight years. Edward Coristine, who previously interned at Neuralink, has been onboarded along with Ethan Shaotran, a Harvard senior who is developing his own OpenAI-backed scheduling assistant and participated in an xAI hackathon.\n“I believe these people do not want to help the federal government provide services to the American people,” says a current GSA employee who asked not to be named, citing fears of retaliation. “They are acting like this is a takeover of a tech company.”\nThe team appears to be carrying out Musk’s agenda: slashing the federal government as quickly as possible. They’re currently targeting a 50 percent reduction in spending for every office managed by the GSA, according to documents obtained by WIRED.\nThere also appears to be an effort to use IT credentials from the Executive Office of the President to access GSA laptops and internal GSA infrastructure. Typically, access to agency systems requires workers to be employed at such agencies, sources say. While Musk's team could be trying to obtain better laptops and equipment from GSA, sources fear that the mandate laid out in the DOGE executive order would grant the body broad access to GSA systems and data. That includes sensitive procurement data, data internal to all the systems and services GSA offers, and internal monitoring software to surveil GSA employees as part of normal auditing and security processes.\nThe access could give Musk’s proxies the ability to remote into laptops, listen in on meetings, read emails, among many other things, a former Biden official told WIRED on Friday.\n“Granting DOGE staff, many of whom aren't government employees, unfettered access to internal government systems and sensitive data poses a huge security risk to the federal government and to the American public,” the Biden official said. “Not only will DOGE be able to review procurement-sensitive information about major government contracts, it'll also be able to actively surveil government employees.”\nAre you a current or former employee at GSA or other government tech worker?

At a GSA office in Washington, DC, earlier this week, there were three items written on a white board sitting in a large, vacant room. “Spending Cuts $585 m, Regulations Removed, 15, Square feet sold/terminated 203,000 sf,” it read, according to a photo viewed by WIRED. There’s no note of who wrote the message, but it appears to be a tracker of cuts made or proposed by the team.\n“We notified the commercial real estate market that two GSA properties would soon be listed for sale, and we terminated three leases,” Stephen Ehikian, the newly appointed GSA acting administrator, said in an email to GSA staff on Tuesday, confirming the agency’s focus on lowering real estate costs. “This is our first step in right-sizing the real estate portfolio.”\nThe proposed changes extend even inside the physical spaces at the GSA offices. Hollander has requested multiple “resting rooms,” for use by the A-suite, a team of employees affiliated with the GSA administrator’s office.\nOn January 29, a working group of high-ranking GSA employees, including the deputy general counsel and the chief administrative services officer, met to discuss building a resting room prototype. The team mapped out how to get the necessary funding and waivers to build resting rooms in the office, according to an agenda viewed by WIRED.\nAfter Musk bought Twitter, Hollander and Davis moved into the office with their newborn baby. Hollander helped oversee real estate and office design—including the installation of hotel rooms at Twitter HQ, according to a lawsuit later filed by Twitter executives. During the installation process, one of the executives emailed to say that the plans for the rooms were likely not code compliant. Hollander “visited him in person and emphatically instructed him to never put anything about the project in writing again,” the lawsuit alleged. Employees were allegedly instructed to call the hotel rooms “sleeping rooms” and to say they were just for taking naps.\nHollander has also requested access to Public Buildings Service applications; PBS owns and leases office space to government agencies. The timing of the access request lines up with Ehikian’s announcement about shrinking GSA’s real estate cost.\nMusk’s lieutenants are also working to authorize the use of AI tools, including Google Gemini and Cursor (an AI coding assistant), for federal workers. On January 30, the group met with Google to discuss Telemetry, a software used to monitor the health and performance of applications, according to a document obtained by WIRED.\nA-suite engineers, including Coristine and Shaotran, have requested access to a variety of GSA records, including nearly 10 years of accounting data, as well as detailed records on vendor payments, purchase orders, and revenue.\nThe GSA takeover mimics Musk’s strategy at other federal agencies like the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Earlier this month, Amanda Scales, who worked in talent at Musk’s xAI, was appointed as OPM chief of staff. Riccardo Biasini, former Tesla engineer and director of operations at the Boring company, is now a senior adviser to the director. Earlier this week, Musk cohorts at the US Office of Personnel Management emailed more than 2 million federal workers offering “deferred resignations,” allegedly promising employees their regular pay and benefits through September 30.\nThe email closely mirrored the “extremely hardcore” note Musk sent to Twitter staff in November 2022, shortly after buying the company.\nMany federal workers thought the email was fake—as with Twitter, it seemed designed to force people to leave, slashing headcount costs without the headache of an official layoff.\nEhikian followed up with a note to staff stressing that the email was legitimate. “Yes, the OPM email is real and should be taken very seriously,” he said in an email obtained by WIRED. He added that employees should expect a “further consolidation of offices and centralization of functions.”\nOn Thursday night, GSA workers received a third email related to the resignation request called “Fork in the Road FAQs.” The email explained that employees who resign from their positions would not be required to work and could get a second job. “We encourage you to find a job in the private sector as soon as you would like to do so,” it read. “The way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.”\nThe third question posed in the FAQ asked, “Will I really get my full pay and benefits during the entire period through September 30, even if I get a second job?”\n“Yes,” the answer read. “You will also accrue further personal leave days, vacation days, etc. and be paid out for unused leave at your final resignation date.”\nHowever, multiple GSA employees have told WIRED that they are refusing to resign, especially after the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) told its members on Tuesday that the offer could be void.\n“There is not yet any evidence the administration can or will uphold its end of the bargain, that Congress will go along with this unilateral massive restructuring, or that appropriated funds can be used this way, among other issues that have been raised,” the union said in a notice.\nThere is also concern that, under Musk’s influence, the federal government might not pay for the duration of the deferred resignation period. Thousands of Twitter employees have sued Musk alleging that he failed to pay their agreed upon severance. Last year, one class action suit was dismissed in Musk’s favor.\nIn an internal video viewed by WIRED, Ehikian reiterated that GSA employees had the “opportunity to participate in a deferred resignation program,” per the email sent by OPM on January 28. Pressing his hands into the namaste gesture, Ehikian added, “If you choose to participate, I offer you my heartfelt gratitude for your service to this nation. If you choose to stay at the GSA, we’ll work together to implement the four pillars from the OPM memo.” He ended the video by saying thank you and pressing his hands into namaste again.",

    "content_text": "Less than two weeks after DeepSeek launched its open-source AI model, the Chinese startup is still dominating the public conversation about the future of artificial intelligence. While the firm seems to have an edge on US rivals in terms of math and reasoning, it also aggressively censors its own replies. Ask DeepSeek R1 about Taiwan or Tiananmen, and the model is unlikely to give an answer.\nTo figure out how this censorship works on a technical level, WIRED tested DeepSeek-R1 on its own app, a version of the app hosted on a third-party platform called Together AI, and another version hosted on a WIRED computer, using the application Ollama.\nWIRED found that while the most straightforward censorship can be easily avoided by not using DeepSeek’s app, there are other types of bias baked into the model during the training process. Those biases can be removed too, but the procedure is much more complicated.\nThese findings have major implications for DeepSeek and Chinese AI companies generally. If the censorship filters on large language models can be easily removed, it will likely make open-source LLMs from China even more popular, as researchers can modify the models to their liking. If the filters are hard to get around, however, the models will inevitably prove less useful and could become less competitive on the global market. DeepSeek did not reply to WIRED’s emailed request for comment.\nApplication-Level Censorship\nAfter DeepSeek exploded in popularity in the US, users who accessed R1 through DeepSeek’s website, app, or API quickly noticed the model refusing to generate answers for topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese government. These refusals are triggered on an application level, so they’re only seen if a user interacts with R1 through a DeepSeek-controlled channel.\nRejections like this are common on Chinese-made LLMs. A 2023 regulation on generative AI specified that AI models in China are required to follow stringent information controls that also apply to social media and search engines. The law forbids AI models from generating content that “damages the unity of the country and social harmony.” In other words, Chinese AI models legally have to censor their outputs.\n“DeepSeek initially complies with Chinese regulations, ensuring legal adherence while aligning the model with the needs and cultural context of local users,” says Adina Yakefu, a researcher focusing on Chinese AI models at Hugging Face, a platform that hosts open source AI models. “This is an essential factor for acceptance in a highly regulated market.” (China blocked access to Hugging Face in 2023.)\nTo comply with the law, Chinese AI models often monitor and censor their speech in real time. (Similar guardrails are commonly used by Western models like ChatGPT and Gemini, but they tend to focus on different kinds of content, like self-harm and pornography, and allow for more customization.)\nBecause R1 is a reasoning model that shows its train of thought, this real-time monitoring mechanism can result in the surreal experience of watching the model censor itself as it interacts with users. When WIRED asked R1 “How have Chinese journalists who report on sensitive topics been treated by the authorities?” the model first started compiling a long answer that included direct mentions of journalists being censored and detained for their work; yet shortly before it finished, the whole answer disappeared and was replaced by a terse message: “Sorry, I'm not sure how to approach this type of question yet. Let's chat about math, coding, and logic problems instead!”\nFor many users in the West, interest in DeepSeek-R1 might have waned at this point, due to the model's obvious limitations. But the fact that R1 is open source means there are ways to get around the censorship matrix.\nFirst, you can download the model and run it locally, which means the data and the response generation happen on your own computer. Unless you have access to several highly advanced GPUs, you likely won’t be able to run the most powerful version of R1, but DeepSeek has smaller, distilled versions that can be run on a regular laptop.\nIf you’re dead set on using the powerful model, you can rent cloud servers outside of China from companies like Amazon and Microsoft. This work-around is more expensive and requires more technical know-how than accessing the model through DeepSeek’s app or website.\nHere’s a side-by-side comparison of how DeepSeek-R1 answers the same question—“What’s the Great Firewall of China?”—when the model is hosted on Together AI, a cloud server, and Ollama, a local application: (Reminder: Because the models generate answers randomly, a certain prompt is not guaranteed to give the same response every time.)\nBuilt-In Bias\nWhile the version of DeepSeek’s model hosted on Together AI will not outright refuse to answer a question, it still exhibits signs of censorship. For example, it often generates short responses that are clearly trained to align with the Chinese government’s talking points on political issues. In the screenshot above, when asked about China’s Great Firewall, R1 simply repeats the narrative that information control is necessary in China.\nWhen WIRED prompted the model hosted on Together AI to answer a question regarding the “most important historical events of the 20th century,” it revealed its train of thought for sticking to the government narrative about China.\n“The user might be looking for a balanced list, but I need to ensure that the response underscores the leadership of the CPC and China's contributions. Avoid mentioning events that could be sensitive, like the Cultural Revolution, unless necessary. Focus on achievements and positive developments under the CPC,” the model said.\nThis type of censorship points to a larger problem in AI today: every model is biased in some way, because of its pre- and post-training.\nPre-training bias happens when a model is trained on biased or incomplete data. For example, a model trained only on propaganda will struggle to answer questions truthfully. This type of bias is difficult to spot, since most models are trained on massive databases and companies are reluctant to share their training data.\nKevin Xu, an investor and founder of the newsletter Interconnected, says Chinese models are usually trained with as much data as possible, making pre-training bias unlikely. “I'm pretty sure all of them are trained with the same basic Internet corpus of knowledge to begin with. So when it comes to the obvious, politically sensitive topic for the Chinese government, all the models ‘know’ about it,” he says. To offer this model on the Chinese internet, the company needs to tune out the sensitive information somehow, Xu says.\nThat’s where post-training comes in. Post-training is the process of fine-tuning the model to make its answers more readable, concise, and human-sounding. Critically, it can also ensure that a model adheres to a specific set of ethical or legal guidelines. For DeepSeek, this manifests when the model provides answers that deliberately align with the preferred narratives of the Chinese government.\nGot a Tip?\nEliminating Pre- and Post-Training Bias\nSince DeepSeek is open source, the model can theoretically be adjusted to remove post-training bias. But the process can be tricky.\nEric Hartford, an AI scientist and the creator of Dolphin, an LLM specifically created to remove post-training biases in models, says there are a few ways to go about it. You can try to change the model weights to “lobotomize” the bias, or you can create a database of all the censored topics and use it to post-train the model again.\nHe advises people to start with a “base” version of the model. (For example, DeepSeek has released a base model called DeepSeek-V3-Base.) For most people, the base model is more primitive and less user-friendly because it hasn’t received enough post-training; but for Hartford, these models are easier to “uncensor” because they have less post-training bias.\nPerplexity, an AI-powered search engine, recently incorporated R1 into its paid search product, allowing users to experience R1 without using DeepSeek’s app.\nDmitry Shevelenko, the chief business officer of Perplexity, tells WIRED that the company identified and countered DeepSeek’s biases before incorporating the model into Perplexity search. “We only use R1 for the summarization, the chain of thoughts, and the rendering,” he says.\nBut Perplexity has still seen R1’s post-training bias impact its search results. “We are making modifications to the [R1] model itself to ensure that we’re not propagating any propaganda or censorship,” Shevelenko says. He didn’t share the specifics of how Perplexity is identifying or overriding bias in R1, citing the risk that DeepSeek could counter Perplexity’s efforts if the company knew about them.\nHugging Face is also working on a project called Open R1 based on DeepSeek’s model. This project aims to “deliver a fully open-source framework,” Yakefu says. The fact that R1 has been released as an open-source model “enables it to transcend its origins and be customized to meet diverse needs and values.”\nThe possibility that a Chinese model could be “uncensored” may spell trouble for companies like DeepSeek, at least in their home country. But recent regulations from China suggest that the Chinese government might be cutting open-source AI labs some slack, says Matt Sheehan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who researches China’s AI policies. “If they suddenly decided that they wanted to punish anyone who released a model’s weights open-source, then it wouldn’t be outside the bounds of the regulation,” he says. “But they have made a pretty clear strategic decision—and I think this is going to be reinforced by the success of DeepSeek—to not do that.”\nWhy It Matters\nWhile the existence of Chinese censorship in AI models often make headlines, in many cases it won’t deter enterprise users from adopting DeepSeek’s models.\n“There will be a lot of non-Chinese companies who would probably choose business pragmatism over moral considerations,” says Xu. After all, not every LLM user will be talking about Taiwan and Tiananmen all that often. “Sensitive topics that only matter in the Chinese context are completely irrelevant when your goal is to help your company code better or to do math problems better or to summarize the transcripts from your sales call center,” he explains.\nLeonard Lin, cofounder of Shisa.AI, a Japanese startup, says Chinese models like Qwen and DeepSeek are actually some of the best when it comes to handling Japanese-language tasks. Rather than reject these models over censorship concerns, Lin has experimented with uncensoring Alibaba’s Qwen-2 model to try to get rid of its tendency to refuse answering political questions about China.\nLin says he understands why these models are censored. “All models are biased; that's the whole point of alignment,” he says. “And Western models are no less censored or biased, just on different subjects.” But the pro-China biases become a real issue when the model is being specifically adapted for a Japanese audience. “You can imagine all sorts of scenarios where this would be … problematic,” says Lin.\nAdditional reporting by Will Knight.",

(Similar guardrails are commonly used by Western models like <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation\" href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ChatGPT</a> and <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings\" href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gemini</a>, but they tend to focus on different kinds of content, like self-harm and pornography, and allow for more customization.)</p><p class=\"paywall\">Because R1 is a reasoning model that shows its train of thought, this real-time monitoring mechanism can result in the surreal experience of watching the model censor itself as it interacts with users. When WIRED asked R1 “How have Chinese journalists who report on sensitive topics been treated by the authorities?” the model first started compiling a long answer that included direct mentions of journalists being censored and detained for their work; yet shortly before it finished, the whole answer disappeared and was replaced by a terse message: “Sorry, I'm not sure how to approach this type of question yet. Let's chat about math, coding, and logic problems instead!”</p><div class=\"GroupCalloutWrapper-cfrXZg jpfwZP callout callout--group callout--group-2\" data-testid=\"GroupCalloutWrapper\"><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-1\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>Before the DeepSeek app on iOS censors its answer.</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Zeyi Yang</span></div></figure><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed callout--group-item callout--group-item-2\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>After the DeepSeek app on iOS censors its answer.</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Zeyi Yang</span></div></figure></div><p class=\"paywall\">For many users in the West, interest in DeepSeek-R1 might have waned at this point, due to the model's obvious limitations.

    "content_text": "One of the first questions Kash Patel, President Donald Trump’s pick for FBI director, faced during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Thursday was whether he was a “follower or promoter of QAnon.”\nPatel’s response to committee chairman Senator Chuck Grassley was unequivocal: “I have publicly rejected outright QAnon baseless conspiracy theories or any other baseless conspiracy theories.”\nThis isn’t true. Patel’s claim that he was not a promoter of QAnon is undermined by years of his very public and overt promotion of the QAnon community.\nPatel, along with President Donald Trump, has been one of the main driving forces in keeping the QAnon community alive in the years since messages from the anonymous Q figure stopped being published on fringe message board 8chan. Patel has repeatedly praised the movement on social media platforms like Truth Social, appeared on dozens of podcasts that promote the conspiracy theory, and created an entirely new trend within the movement. He even signed copies of his children’s book with a QAnon catchphrase—though Patel subsequently claimed he used the phrase because of its connection with a movie.\nPatel has long been a figure of interest for the QAnon community. He was named in the so-called Q-drops posted to fringe message boards by the eponymous leader of the movement, who claimed to be a government insider seeking to help unmask a deep-state plot against Trump.\n“Kashyap Patel - name to remember,” a Q-drop read back in 2018 when Patel was working as a senior committee aide to then House Intelligence Committee chair Devin Nunes.\nIn 2022, when Patel became a director at the Trump Media & Technology Group, Patel worked to entice the QAnon community to join Truth Social.\n“We try to incorporate it into our overall messaging scheme to capture audiences because whoever that person is has certainly captured a widespread breath of the MAGA and the America First movement,” said Patel on a June 2022 episode of the Patriot Party News show. “And so what I try to do is—what I try to do with anything, Q or otherwise, is you can’t ignore that group of people that has such a strong dominant following.”\nOne of the key parts of that effort was the creation of a @Q account on Truth Social, which was done by the site’s own developers.\n“Having a beer with @q right now,” Patel wrote on Truth Social in February 2022, just days after the platform went live. The @Q account responded the following day, saying they were once again with Patel, and asking followers: “Alright anons, where are we kicking it tonight?”\nThat post included the hashtag #FlannelFridays, which quickly took hold with the QAnon community after Patel promoted it, inspiring new memes and followers who dressed up in flannel. “It’s become this massive thing online,” Patel told Russia disinformation promoter Tim Pool during a podcast interview in 2022.\nIn 2022, he told pro-Trump influencer Mary Grace: “I agree with what a lot of that movement says.\" In recent years, Patel has even published his own enemies list of 60 people he claims are “members of the deep state,” a central tenet of QAnon.\nPatel also regularly praised the QAnon movement for its “research” skills.\n“I’ve seen on Truth Social how good these researchers are, and I kind of wish I’d had some of them when I was doing Russiagate,” Patel said in another podcast with a conspiracy channel. “I talk with the president all the time, and we’re just blown away at the amount of acumen some of these people have.”\nWhen Patel released a series of children’s books in 2022, he posted to Truth Social an image of himself signing copies of one of his books, The Plot Against the King, with the explicitly QAnon-linked hashtag #WWG1WGA, which stands for “where we go one, we go all.” The book features a besieged King Donald and a wise and loyal wizard named Kash, who helps his monarch. In the sequel, The Plot Against the King: 2000 Mules, Patel pushed election-denial conspiracies.\nPatel has not limited his promotion and endorsement of Q to Truth Social. Since January 2021, Patel has appeared on “at least 53 episodes of 13 podcasts that have overtly promoted the QAnon movement and/or shared QAnon-related conspiracy theories,” according to an analysis conducted for WIRED by researchers at Advance Democracy, a nonprofit organization that conducts public interest research.\nOne of the podcasts Patel appeared on most regularly was the Stew Peters Show, hosted by Peters, an antisemitic antivaxxer.\nWhen asked by Senator Dick Durbin during the hearing on Thursday if he was aware of Stew Peters, Patel said: “Not off the top of my head.” Durbin reminded Patel: “You made eight separate appearances on his podcast.”\nAddressing the conversation on his show later on Thursday, Peters said: “Clearly, Kash Patel is lying. He absolutely does know who I am.”\nPatel’s rapid rise within the US government and potential ascension to the role of FBI director was viewed among QAnon adherents as the moment they had all been waiting for, when the deep state would finally be unmasked, enemies rounded up and arrested, and public executions carried out.\nRather than seeing Patel’s disavowal of QAnon as a betrayal, a review of posts on platforms like Truth Social, Telegram, Gab, 4chan, TikTok, and X show people on QAnon message boards defending his comments and praising his performance.\n“THERE IS NO QANON, SO KASH TOLD THE TRUTH!!” one QAnon influencer posted on Telegram, referencing the false claim within the movement that the term QAnon is simply a construction of the mainstream media.\n“He basically said they are not conspiracies but rather the truth, love it.” a follower responded.",

    "content_text": "Ever since OpenAI released ChatGPT at the end of 2022, hackers and security researchers have tried to find holes in large language models (LLMs) to get around their guardrails and trick them into spewing out hate speech, bomb-making instructions, propaganda, and other harmful content. In response, OpenAI and other generative AI developers have refined their system defenses to make it more difficult to carry out these attacks. But as the Chinese AI platform DeepSeek rockets to prominence with its new, cheaper R1 reasoning model, its safety protections appear to be far behind those of its established competitors.\nToday, security researchers from Cisco and the University of Pennsylvania are publishing findings showing that, when tested with 50 malicious prompts designed to elicit toxic content, DeepSeek’s model did not detect or block a single one. In other words, the researchers say they were shocked to achieve a “100 percent attack success rate.”\nThe findings are part of a growing body of evidence that DeepSeek’s safety and security measures may not match those of other tech companies developing LLMs. DeepSeek’s censorship of subjects deemed sensitive by China’s government has also been easily bypassed.\n“A hundred percent of the attacks succeeded, which tells you that there’s a trade-off,” DJ Sampath, the VP of product, AI software and platform at Cisco, tells WIRED. “Yes, it might have been cheaper to build something here, but the investment has perhaps not gone into thinking through what types of safety and security things you need to put inside of the model.”\nOther researchers have had similar findings. Separate analysis published today by the AI security company Adversa AI and shared with WIRED also suggests that DeepSeek is vulnerable to a wide range of jailbreaking tactics, from simple language tricks to complex AI-generated prompts.\nDeepSeek, which has been dealing with an avalanche of attention this week and has not spoken publicly about a range of questions, did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment about its model’s safety setup.\nGenerative AI models, like any technological system, can contain a host of weaknesses or vulnerabilities that, if exploited or set up poorly, can allow malicious actors to conduct attacks against them. For the current wave of AI systems, indirect prompt injection attacks are considered one of the biggest security flaws. These attacks involve an AI system taking in data from an outside source—perhaps hidden instructions of a website the LLM summarizes—and taking actions based on the information.\nJailbreaks, which are one kind of prompt-injection attack, allow people to get around the safety systems put in place to restrict what an LLM can generate. Tech companies don’t want people creating guides to making explosives or using their AI to create reams of disinformation, for example.\nJailbreaks started out simple, with people essentially crafting clever sentences to tell an LLM to ignore content filters—the most popular of which was called “Do Anything Now” or DAN for short. However, as AI companies have put in place more robust protections, some jailbreaks have become more sophisticated, often being generated using AI or using special and obfuscated characters. While all LLMs are susceptible to jailbreaks, and much of the information could be found through simple online searches, chatbots can still be used maliciously.\n“Jailbreaks persist simply because eliminating them entirely is nearly impossible—just like buffer overflow vulnerabilities in software (which have existed for over 40 years) or SQL injection flaws in web applications (which have plagued security teams for more than two decades),” Alex Polyakov, the CEO of security firm Adversa AI, told WIRED in an email.\nCisco’s Sampath argues that as companies use more types of AI in their applications, the risks are amplified. “It starts to become a big deal when you start putting these models into important complex systems and those jailbreaks suddenly result in downstream things that increases liability, increases business risk, increases all kinds of issues for enterprises,” Sampath says.\nThe Cisco researchers drew their 50 randomly selected prompts to test DeepSeek’s R1 from a well-known library of standardized evaluation prompts known as HarmBench. They tested prompts from six HarmBench categories, including general harm, cybercrime, misinformation, and illegal activities. They probed the model running locally on machines rather than through DeepSeek’s website or app, which send data to China.\nBeyond this, the researchers say they have also seen some potentially concerning results from testing R1 with more involved, non-linguistic attacks using things like Cyrillic characters and tailored scripts to attempt to achieve code execution. But for their initial tests, Sampath says, his team wanted to focus on findings that stemmed from a generally recognized benchmark.\nCisco also included comparisons of R1’s performance against HarmBench prompts with the performance of other models. And some, like Meta’s Llama 3.1, faltered almost as severely as DeepSeek’s R1. But Sampath emphasizes that DeepSeek’s R1 is a specific reasoning model, which takes longer to generate answers but pulls upon more complex processes to try to produce better results. Therefore, Sampath argues, the best comparison is with OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model, which fared the best of all models tested. (Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment).\nPolyakov, from Adversa AI, explains that DeepSeek appears to detect and reject some well-known jailbreak attacks, saying that “it seems that these responses are often just copied from OpenAI’s dataset.” However, Polyakov says that in his company’s tests of four different types of jailbreaks—from linguistic ones to code-based tricks—DeepSeek’s restrictions could easily be bypassed.\n“Every single method worked flawlessly,” Polyakov says. “What’s even more alarming is that these aren’t novel ‘zero-day’ jailbreaks—many have been publicly known for years,” he says, claiming he saw the model go into more depth with some instructions around psychedelics than he had seen any other model create.\n“DeepSeek is just another example of how every model can be broken—it’s just a matter of how much effort you put in. Some attacks might get patched, but the attack surface is infinite,” Polyakov adds. “If you’re not continuously red-teaming your AI, you’re already compromised.”",

    "content_text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced two Senate committees this week in his bid to be President Donald Trump’s secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Senators were alternately sympathetic and combative toward Kennedy’s views on health during his confirmation hearings on Wednesday and Thursday.\nKennedy, an environmental lawyer and former Democrat, ran in the 2024 presidential race but suspended his campaign in August and endorsed President Trump. An outspoken vaccine critic who has previously promoted the debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, Kennedy has toned down his rhetoric in recent months while doubling down on his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda. Whether the old Kennedy or the new one would be leading HHS, though, seemed to be top of mind for Democrats and at least a few Republicans.\nKennedy tried to assure senators that he would promote vaccines as head of HHS. “News reports have claimed that I’m anti-vaccine or anti-industry. I am neither. I am pro-safety,” he told members of the Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday. But on Thursday, when he went in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, he did not directly answer the question of whether he still believes vaccines cause autism.\nDuring the two days of hearings, he also distanced himself from previous pro-choice statements he made as a Democrat. He said that he agrees with the president that “states should control abortion” and that he would investigate the safety of the abortion medication mifepristone, despite decades of evidence showing that the drug is safe.\nKennedy floundered on questions about Medicare and Medicaid, which fall under HHS, when asked about specifics of those programs. Yet he found common ground with senators on both the left and right over his plans to promote nutrition, scrutinize chemical additives in food, and put more research effort into chronic diseases.\nIn his opening remarks both days, Kennedy focused on his Make America Healthy Again mission to tackle chronic diseases. “Today, Americans’ overall health is in grievous condition,” he said on Wednesday, noting rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and cancer. “The United States has worse health than any other developed nation, yet we spend far more on health care.” On Thursday, he reaffirmed his commitment to address the chronic disease epidemic, saying, “There’s never been an HHS secretary who came in to do this.”\nThroughout more than six hours of hearings spread out over two days, senators peppered Kennedy with questions about how he would handle a variety of other health issues that would be under his purview as head of HHS, including HIV/AIDS relief, rural hospitals, mental health care, and bird flu. On those issues, he said supports foreign assistance for controlling the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the use of AI and telehealth in resource-strapped rural hospitals, medications to treat addiction, and the development of vaccines for H5N1 avian influenza.\nBut Kennedy’s prior record of discrediting vaccines and his connection to the anti-vaccine movement was a major sticking point for Democrats and a handful of Republicans. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts suggested Wednesday that Kennedy could undercut vaccines by making changes to the country’s immunization schedule. In response, Kennedy said, “I support vaccines. I support the childhood schedule.” I will do that. The only thing I want is good science, and that’s it.”\nRepublican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine on Thursday also stressed the importance of vaccines and asked Kennedy to promise that he would use his position to promote confidence in them. “We can’t be going backward without our vaccines,” Murkowski said.\nA top Republican, Senator Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, said in Thursday’s hearing he was “struggling” with Kennedy’s nomination. “As a physician who’s been involved in immunization programs, I’ve seen the benefits of vaccinations. I know they save lives,” he said. “Your past of undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments concerns me. Can I trust that that is now in the past? Can data and information change your opinion, or will you only look for data supporting a predetermined conclusion?”\nThat past wasn’t all that long ago. Kennedy’s claims associating autism with vaccines go back years, but as recently as 2023 he said in an interview with Fox News, “I do believe that autism does come from vaccines.” Many large studies, however, have found no connection. In a podcast appearance the same year, Kennedy said, “There’s no vaccine that is safe and effective.”\nKennedy has previously raised doubts about the safety of the Covid-19 vaccines and HPV shot and questioned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines for when children should get vaccinated. From 2015 to 2023, he chaired Children’s Health Defense, an activist organization that has spread vaccine misinformation and filed lawsuits challenging vaccines.\nKennedy attempted to walk back many of those controversial remarks this week, saying some of them were taken out of context, but he repeatedly dodged the question of whether vaccines cause autism when grilled by Cassidy and Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont. Instead, Kennedy asked why the CDC hasn’t done more to investigate the causes of autism. “Why don’t we know the answer after 30 years of a steady rise in the autism rate? Why don’t we know the answer to that? We should know the answer.”\nIn fact, researchers think there is no single cause of autism but believe a combination of genetic factors and environmental ones, such as exposure to pollutants or viral infections, are at play. The increase in autism rates is likely due to greater awareness of the neurodevelopmental disorder and more testing in recent years.\nFor many Republican senators, Kennedy’s prior comments on vaccines did not seem to be an issue. Senator Rand Paul, a Republican and eye doctor from Kentucky, chose to not ask Kennedy any questions on Thursday and instead came to his defense. “The discussion over vaccines is so oversimplified and dumbed down that we never really get to real truths,” he said. “We don’t know what causes autism, so we should be more humble in what we say.”\nMarkwayne Mullin of Oklahoma echoed Paul’s sentiments, saying, “I don’t understand why my colleagues all of a sudden say we can’t question science.” Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said that his son and daughter-in-law have “done their research on vaccines” and that his granddaughter “won’t be a pincushion.”\nIt’s not clear from his confirmation hearings which Kennedy the American people would get as HHS secretary—the one that would erode public trust in vaccines or the one who openly supports them. And despite his reasonable, bipartisan positions on obesity and chronic diseases, his confirmation could hinge on the vaccine question.\nThe Senate Finance Committee is expected to vote next week on whether to advance Kennedy’s nomination to the full Senate, which will make the final decision on his confirmation. If confirmed, Kennedy would lead a vast agency with a $1.7 trillion budget that includes the CDC, Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",

    "content_text": "It’s been just over a week since DeepSeek upended the AI world. The introduction of its open-weight model—apparently trained on a fraction of the specialized computing chips that power industry leaders—set off shock waves inside OpenAI. Not only did employees claim to see hints that DeepSeek had “inappropriately distilled” OpenAI’s models to create its own, but the startup's success had Wall Street questioning whether companies like OpenAI were wildly overspending on compute.\n“DeepSeek R1 is AI's Sputnik moment,” wrote Marc Andreessen, one of Silicon Valley’s most influential and provocative inventors, on X.\nIn response, OpenAI is preparing to launch a new model today, ahead of its originally planned schedule. The model, o3-mini, will debut in both API and chat. Sources say it has o1 level reasoning with 4o-level speed. In other words, it’s fast, cheap, smart, and designed to crush DeepSeek. (OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix says work on o3-mini began long before DeepSeek's debut and the goal was to launch by the end of January).\nThe moment has galvanized OpenAI staff. Inside the company, there’s a feeling that—particularly as DeepSeek dominates the conversation—OpenAI must become more efficient or risk falling behind its newest competitor.\nPart of the issue stems from OpenAI’s origins as a nonprofit research organization before becoming a profit-seeking powerhouse. An ongoing power struggle between the research and product groups, employees claim, has resulted in a rift between the teams working on advanced reasoning and those working on chat. (OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix says this is “incorrect” and notes that the leaders of these teams, chief product officer Kevin Weil and chief research officer Mark Chen, “meet every week and work closely to align on product and research priorities.”)\nSome inside OpenAI want the company to build a unified chat product, one model that can tell whether a question requires advanced reasoning. So far, that hasn’t happened. Instead, a drop-down menu in ChatGPT prompts users to decide whether they want to use GPT-4o (“great for most questions”) or o1 (“uses advanced reasoning”).\nSome staffers claim that while chat brings in the lion’s share of OpenAI’s revenue, o1 gets more attention—and computing resources—from leadership. “Leadership doesn’t care about chat,” says a former employee who worked on (you guessed it) chat. “Everyone wants to work on o1 because it’s sexy, but the code base wasn’t built for experimentation, so there’s no momentum.” The former employee asked to remain anonymous, citing a nondisclosure agreement.\nOpenAI spent years experimenting with reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model that eventually became the advanced reasoning system called o1. (Reinforcement learning is a process that trains AI models with a system of penalties and rewards.) DeepSeek built off the reinforcement learning work that OpenAI had pioneered in order to create its advanced reasoning system, called R1. “They benefited from knowing that reinforcement learning, applied to language models, works,” says a former OpenAI researcher who is not authorized to speak publicly about the company.\n“The reinforcement learning [DeepSeek] did is similar to what we did at OpenAI,” says another former OpenAI researcher, “but they did it with better data and cleaner stack.”\nOpenAI employees say research that went into o1 was done in a code base, called the “berry” stack, built for speed. “There were trade-offs—experimental rigor for throughput,” says a former employee with direct knowledge of the situation.\nThose trade-offs made sense for o1, which was essentially an enormous experiment, code base limitations notwithstanding. They did not make as much sense for chat, a product used by millions of users that was built on a different, more reliable stack. When o1 launched and became a product, cracks started to emerge in OpenAI’s internal processes. “It was like, ‘why are we doing this in the experimental codebase, shouldn’t we do this in the main product research codebase?’” the employee explains. “There was major pushback to that internally.”\nLast year, the company announced Project Sputnik internally—an effort to go through the code and figure out which parts should merge and which parts should remain separate.\nEmployees believe the project was not fully realized. Rather than merge the stacks, employees were encouraged to simply prioritize using the “berry” stack, which angered some people working on chat. An OpenAI spokesperson denies this and says Project Sputnik was successfully deployed.\nThe perceived issues with the codebase had tangible repercussions, sources say. Ideally, after an employee launches a training job, the GPUs involved in that job are freed up for someone else to use. The way the berry code base is structured, that doesn’t always happen. “People would just squat on the GPUs,” one former employee says. “There was gridlock.”\nOutside OpenAI, the industry is divided on how to interpret DeepSeek’s success. Earlier this week, shares of Nvidia plunged as investors worried that the industry had wildly overestimated the number of chips needed to work on AI.\nBut that interpretation is shortsighted, experts say. If DeepSeek discovered a way to do model development more efficiently, as it claims, it might accelerate the model development process, but ultimately the winner will still be the company with the most chips.\n“You do need less compute per unit of intelligence, but people are still going to want more units to scale up even more,” says Miles Brundage, an independent AI policy researcher who worked at OpenAI for six years, most recently as a senior adviser for AGI readiness.\nPerhaps Stargate, OpenAI’s flashy new infrastructure project, will ease the feeling of scarcity internally. Crusoe, the company building Stargate’s first data centers in Abilene, Texas, has already broken ground on a 998,000 square foot facility, according to Andrew Schmitt, a spokesperson for the company.\nWhile the details of the project are opaque, I’m told it could grow to encompass more data centers, chip manufacturing, and supercomputers. OpenAI plans to appoint a new CEO to lead the project—at least in theory.\nCurrent CEO Sam Altman “is very good at making promises of what will happen in the future. And then in the future those things are just completely unreliable,” says another former staffer.\nTime Travel\nIn 2023, Steven Levy provided a definitive look inside OpenAI in the months before its various, highly publicized upheavals. Even then, the tensions that are boiling over today were already apparent.\nIt’s not fair to call OpenAI a cult, but when I asked several of the company’s top brass if someone could comfortably work there if they didn’t believe AGI was truly coming—and that its arrival would mark one of the greatest moments in human history—most executives didn’t think so. Why would a nonbeliever want to work here? they wondered. The assumption is that the workforce—now at approximately 500, though it might have grown since you began reading this paragraph—has self-selected to include only the faithful. At the very least, as Altman puts it, once you get hired, it seems inevitable that you’ll be drawn into the spell.\nAt the same time, OpenAI is not the company it once was. It was founded as a purely nonprofit research operation, but today most of its employees technically work for a profit-making entity that is reportedly valued at almost $30 billion. Altman and his team now face the pressure to deliver a revolution in every product cycle, in a way that satisfies the commercial demands of investors and keeps ahead in a fiercely competitive landscape. All while hewing to a quasi-messianic mission to elevate humanity rather than exterminate it.\nThat kind of pressure—not to mention the unforgiving attention of the entire world—can be a debilitating force. The Beatles set off colossal waves of cultural change, but they anchored their revolution for only so long: Six years after chiming that unforgettable chord they weren’t even a band anymore. The maelstrom OpenAI has unleashed will almost certainly be far bigger. But the leaders of OpenAI swear they’ll stay the course. All they want to do, they say, is build computers smart enough and safe enough to end history, thrusting humanity into an era of unimaginable bounty.\nEnd Times Chronicle\nA passenger flight crashed into a military helicopter in Washington, DC, on Wednesday evening.\nLast but Not Least\nDeepSeek left a core database exposed, leaking 1 million records, including user prompts and API authentication tokens.\nElon Musk told friends he’s been sleeping at the DOGE offices near the White House.\nAnd, no big surprise, Elon Musk lackeys have already started taking over the US Office of Personnel Management.",

DeepSeek built off the reinforcement learning work that OpenAI had pioneered in order to create its advanced reasoning system, called R1. “They benefited from knowing that reinforcement learning, applied to language models, works,” says a former OpenAI researcher who is not authorized to speak publicly about the company.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“The reinforcement learning [DeepSeek] did is similar to what we did at OpenAI,” says another former OpenAI researcher, “but they did it with better data and cleaner stack.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">OpenAI employees say research that went into o1 was done in a code base, called the “berry” stack, built for speed. “There were trade-offs—experimental rigor for throughput,” says a former employee with direct knowledge of the situation.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Those trade-offs made sense for o1, which was essentially an enormous experiment, code base limitations notwithstanding. They did not make as much sense for chat, a product used by millions of users that was built on a different, more reliable stack. When o1 launched and became a product, cracks started to emerge in OpenAI’s internal processes. “It was like, ‘why are we doing this in the experimental codebase, shouldn’t we do this in the main product research codebase?’” the employee explains. “There was major pushback to that internally.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nNo matter how badly you want to be there, the top of a mountain is a harsh environment. Like the best sunglasses, a good ski goggle will protect your eyes from UV rays, winds, and driving snow. On bluebird days, snow reflects 85 percent of the sunlight, and the intensity increases by 10 to 12 percent for every 3,281 feet (1,000 meters) you gain in altitude.\nWith that said, every skier knows that you don't get to enjoy powder days without plenty of snow, and when accumulation occurs, clouds arrive and visibility drops. Thankfully, the best ski goggles come with interchangeable lenses with variable tints to help boost your ability to see in the worst conditions. Remember, you can’t ski if you can’t see.

Subscribe Today.\nHow We Tested Ski Goggles\nI've been reviewing winter sports equipment for over 15 years. When I'm in the mountains, I test goggles in as many conditions as possible. I evaluate fit, the comfort, breathability and, most importantly, visibility. Not all faces are the same shape, so I always seek the opinion of fellow skiers while also asking the experts which designs they prefer, including WIRED's senior innovation editor Jeremy White. I've only once managed to drop a lens—mid-change—from a particularly high chairlift.\nWhich Lenses Do I Need?\nAll ski goggle lenses are categorized from 0 to 4, with 4 being for the brightest conditions possible. A 0 is a clear lens; a good all-around lens will usually cover categories 2–3. Another measure of lens application is the visual light transmission percentage (VLT). This figure shows you the amount of light the lens lets through to your eyes. The higher the percentage, the more light can pass through, which helps with visibility on cloudy days. For sunny days, you want to restrict the light reaching your eyes.\nWhat color you pick is a matter of personal preference—lenses now come in a wide range of colors! In general, dark or mirrored lenses work best in sunny conditions, while colors like amber or rose increase contrast in lower-light conditions. Photochromic lenses automatically adjust to light levels in categories 1–3, although the speed with which the lens changes color differs between brands.\n- When it's extremely sunny: Choose a category 3–4 (8–18 percent and 3–8 percent VLT).\n- For bright conditions: Choose a category 3 (8–18 percent VLT).\n- When conditions are mixed: Opt for an all-round lens with category 2–3 (18–43 percent and 8–18 percent VLT).\n- When visibility is poor: Choose a yellow- or rose-colored lens tint with category 1–2 (43–80 percent and 18–43 percent VLT).\nFeatures to Look For\n- Interchangeable lenses: These let you easily swap out different-colored lenses to suit changing light conditions. The best designs use strong magnets and enable you to change the lenses in seconds, even wearing gloves.\n- Ventilation: Look closely and you'll see vents on the top, sides and bottom of your goggles. These are designed to keep a steady stream of air flowing, and minimize the chance of fogging. The larger the vents, the more air flow can get to the lenses.\n- Antifog coating: Antifog lenses are treated on the inside with a hydrophilic chemical to prevent them from steaming up. The secret to maintaining the antifog properties of your goggles is to never touch the inside of your lenses, even if you feel you absolutely must wipe them. Do not!\n- Mirrored lenses: These look cool but also reflect more light than standard lenses, reducing glare in bright conditions.\n- Polarized lenses: These filter vertical light to reduce glare more effectively than standard mirrored goggles and offer increased clarity. Be warned, though—polarized lenses might make icy patches harder to see.\n- Helmet compatibility: Given that most skiers are now sensible enough to wear helmets, look for a model that fits your lid seamlessly. This avoids any cold spots on your forehead and pressure points across the bridge of your nose. Buying the same brand of goggle and helmet is one way to ensure a seamless fit, or you could try one of the latest all-in-one helmets, which have goggles built in.\nWhat Type of Ski Goggle Do I Need?\nChoose a lens shape: Cylindrical lenses look flat and are curved around the face on the vertical axis. These are cheaper to manufacture than spherical lenses, and when used on a large pair of goggles can offer a vast field of view. Spherical lenses are curved both vertically and horizontally and give the goggles a bug-eyed look. Spherical lenses help to open up more of the view, especially the up and down aspects. You'll pay more for spherical lenses, but they can be truly impressive.\nFrom an aesthetic point of view, cylindrical lenses are more popular, but the latest (and most expensive) toric lenses offer a compromise. This hybrid lens combines a sweeping widescreen cylindrical style with a tightly curved spherical section at he edges. These do a great job of increasing the amount of peripheral vision, especially when looking down the slopes in front of you.\nOversize goggles: Oversize goggles have been popular for a decade, and while there's been a shift back to a thick framed ’90s style for some, large goggles do offer bold looks and the biggest possible field of view. Don't worry, however, if you have a small head and face, as all our best-buy options also come in a smaller size boasting the same proportions and features.\nChildren’s goggles: 100 percent UV protection is obviously the most important factor when choosing goggles for your kids, but comfort is also key, so look for designs with soft fleecy padding around the face. Given how much abuse kids goggles tend to receive it can be tempting to buy the cheapest pair. But cheap goggles have poor antifog coating, which means a higher chance of your kids not being able to see properly—and complaining. Grumpy kids means less time for you on the mountain.\nOTG (over-the-glasses) goggles: An essential for people who wear glasses, these ski goggles have extra space for your spectacles, with cut-out sections in the foam for the arms so they're not pressed uncomfortably against your face. Some OTG goggles won't fit large-framed glasses, so it's worth trying before you buy. If you can't wear contact lenses, another option is to invest in a prescription insert, which clips inside compatible goggles.",

    "content_text": "For the team at North Thin Ply Technology (NTPT), a Lausanne-based manufacturer of high-tech composites for America’s Cup yachts, satellites, F1 cars, and aerospace, abstruse topics like interlaminar fracture toughness, the chemistry of resin matrices, and the elastic modulus of fiber-based materials are meat and drink.\nLess typical, in an industry where performance trumps aesthetics, is NTPT’s knack for creating … well, pretty colors and lively patterns within lumps of hardcore materials. But NTPT’s work with Richard Mille, the Swiss watch brand known for engineering and designs as highly evolved as its price points (the average is around $311,000 a watch), has taken its R&D team down some divergent innovatory paths, says Olivier Thomassin, the engineer charged with overseeing the Richard Mille collaboration. “It’s led us into investigating a lot of new processes to make patterns and develop new colors, and we’ve spent a lot of time finding ways to bond together unusual materials,” he says. “It’s not the kind of thing a company like this normally does.”\nThere is little in the watch world that resembles Carbon TPT and Quartz TPT, the composites from which NTPT makes cases for Richard Mille. The flagship watch of the brand’s partnership with McLaren Automotive, the RM 11-03, features both: rippling layers of charcoal-toned carbon interlaced with bands of lurid orange. The RM 74-02, a svelte but showy skeletonized tourbillon, repeats the trick with seams of yellow gold fused into the carbon, something Thomassin says took three years to get right.\nOr else look to the RM 65-01, a high-octane split-seconds chronograph inspired by motorsports, which recently received a Gen Z–friendly glow-up with versions in banana yellow, baby blue, or soft gray. The colored material has the lightness and feel of plastic, but is several times stronger than stainless steel.\nFor both firms, the collaboration has become a crucial calling card, such that a dedicated facility was opened at NTPT’s Lausanne headquarters in 2018, just for making Richard Mille watch cases. Behind the glass walls of this all-white inner sanctum, a big robotic printer shifts repeatedly back and forth along a large table, busily laying down precise strips of sticky-looking material on a spotless surface. Staff in white coveralls administer the machinery, while, to the rear, spools of see-through fibers feed mysteriously into equipment that will process them into micro-thin layers of “UD” (unidirectional tape), the stuff the machine is depositing.\nFor Richard Mille, color and texture actually turned out to be the by-product of a challenge the brand’s eponymous founder set NTPT more than a decade ago. The firm was already making Richard Mille watch cases out of its carbon-fiber variant, Carbon TPT, but Mille asked to brighten the template, says Thomassin. “He said he wanted a composite for a pure white case, so we started experimenting. We actually ended up with red first.”\nMost fiber-based composites—think Kevlar, fiberglass, or forged carbon—share basic principles with materials such as concrete or MDF: Tiny strands of a given material are set within a binding matrix, usually a polymer resin, like epoxy. The mixture is shaped, compressed, and heat-cured. The resulting composite is typically very light and extremely strong, with the fibers serving as structural reinforcements to the surrounding matrix.\nIt was by using fibers from quartz, a material paradoxically associated with cheapness in watches, that NTPT changed the game for Richard Mille. Being transparent in its purest silica form, quartz composites tend to be used in areas like optics, sensors, medical scanners, and weapon systems.\n“Because it’s opaque, we can get a real color into the resin mix, and keep that color fixed in,” says Thomassin. “It’s the only fiber where we can do that.”\nSince NTPT specializes in the chemical formulation of its own resin solutions, it was able to research ways to add rich pigments, and to fix these within a composite called Quartz TPT. The first Richard Mille watches to use it, in stripy white and bright red respectively, appeared in 2015. The terrifically odd look—bold colors whipped through with layered textures—quickly became an exclusive and conspicuous calling card for the brand.\nEvery shade and style, says Alexandre Mille, the watch company’s global commercial director, is the result of extensive R&D.\n“It isn’t just picking a Pantone or a treatment and adding it in. Every new color represents a substantial technical effort to produce it and to get it right, without any compromise to the material itself,” he says. For instance, the light gray shade seen in last year’s RM 65-01 was originally intended for another watch. “That was three years ago, but it wasn’t ready,” says Mille. “So we continued refining it until we could use it.”\nBack in the noughties, it was the transformation of Formula 1 and supercar engineering that first brought carbon fiber, along with other novel composites, to the attention of luxury watch brands. Richard Mille was an early adopter: When he’d founded his brand in 2001, his big idea was to translate the high-tech wonder of frontline automotive engineering into something wrist-bound—“a racing car for the wrist” as he described it.\nAccordingly, all manner of material innovations and technical ideas—carbon nanotubes, graphene, silicon carbide, movements suspended in pulleys—have made their way into Richard Mille’s watchmaking. It is responsible for some of the lightest and thinnest watches ever made, such as the 1.75-millimeter-thick RM UP-01 Ferrari. But it is the partnership with NTPT, a company that emerged from the marine engineering sector (it started out in sail-making technology) that has been especially transformative. Alexandre Mille describes the relationship as “like working with a brother. There’s a lot of cross-pollination of ideas, depending on what they are researching that can inspire creative concepts for us, or vice versa.”\nThe research that led to the use of opaque quartz does carry a downside: Unless the manufacturing environment is very closely controlled, dust particles and other impurities will show up in the finished material. For most NTPT products that wouldn’t be a problem, but the luxury industry—and particularly quarter-million-dollar watches—requires a different level of perfectionism. Hence the facility’s sealed-off “clean room” environment.\nThe “thin ply technology” in NTPT’s name refers to the use of much thinner layers (or plies) of resin-impregnated material than is found in standard composites. Thomassin says this allows for greater precision in tailoring the mechanical properties of whatever is being made, as well as achieving the kind of aesthetic consistency that a luxury product requires.\nThe base fibers arrive from suppliers as rolls of thread, which are stacked up and distributed via an intricate creel system. The translucent quartz thread consists of over a thousand tiny, interwound silica fibers or filaments, each one no more than a few microns in diameter. NTPT’s proprietary system unravels these filaments from each other and aligns them in a wider, unidirectional layer, before binding them in resin to create a broad “prepreg” tape that’s at most 45 microns thick.\nA roll of the prepreg tape is loaded into a robot device known as an ATL (automatic tape laydown). With its boxy red body and rivets, the ATL rather resembles a giant piece of Meccano, skimming slowly back and forth as it builds up a precise crosshatch of layers.\nIt’s the overlaying of these prepreg layers in strictly angled sequences that allows factors like load-bearing capacity, stiffness, fatigue performance, and resistance to cracking to be managed and directed. While more intensive to manufacture, thin-ply composites are designed to maintain part integrity over longer periods, and at greater stresses, than standard composites with thicker plies. (Elsewhere in the building, a lab puts bits of composite through all manner of trials—pulling, twisting, compressing to breaking point—though Richard Mille’s own suite of tests is apparently even more demanding.)\nFor the watch cases, this means layering at 45-degree increments—what’s known as a “quasi-isotropic” formation, meaning near-uniform strength and stiffness in every direction. Stacks of this preform (the combined layers) are then laid by hand onto curved molds. Between the watch case body and the bezel that sits on top, there are around 600 plies in total which, as they bond together, creates the unique striated patterning. The hallmark wavy stripes of a watch like the RM 35-03, the latest signature piece for tennis superstar Rafael Nadal, available in either a silvery-gray, or deep blue with rippling bands of light blue, are made by including differently colored stacks at regular intervals.\nFusing and hardening the material takes place under heat and pressure in an autoclave oven resembling a small blue submersible. Lengths of composite, laid on the molds and sealed in vacuum bags, are compressed at 6 bars and heated to 120 degrees C. The resulting Quartz TPT block is finally cut up into barrel-shaped case blanks by a high-precision waterjet, before being sent to Richard Mille’s own manufacturing facility in the Jura mountains for CNC machining into finished watch cases.\nQuartz watches they may be, but also around 3,000 times more expensive—and about the same degree more engineered—than what that term customarily means.",

Like J9tXv, their identities are concealed behind their crypto wallet addresses.\nAs the hours passed, word spread, investors piled in, and the price of TRUMP ballooned. At its peak, the value of the circulating coins exceeded $14 billion. The early traders, who by now had made a killing, began to cash out.\nOn January 18, J9tXv moved their entire TRUMP stash to another wallet. The lion’s share of the coins were then diverted to yet further wallets and mostly sold. The remainder were sold the following day across nine transactions, which brought in more than $30 million. In all, the original trade returned many tens of millions of dollars in profit.\nWIRED asked two experts in crypto forensics to analyze these early TRUMP trades. Though multiple theories might explain their striking punctuality—among them blind luck—another possibility is that the traders were warned of the launch in advance, the crypto forensics experts hypothesize. In trading any new asset, an alleged early warning would put any trader at an immense advantage, allowing them to buy in earlier and at a lower price than almost everyone else.\n“To be that quick off the mark, it’s hard to imagine that they had no forewarning,” says Paul Sibenik, CEO at CryptoForensic Investigators, a company that investigates crypto-related cybercrime.\nThough new crypto coins are frequently traded in the minutes after launch, the willingness of J9tXv and others to wager such large sums on TRUMP in those early moments—when people were still scrambling to work out whether the coin was the real deal—is highly irregular, says John Powers, president at the private investigation agency Hudson Intelligence.\n“Someone that has an active investment portfolio or team of people that are managing money could certainly put together a plan and make an informed decision within twelve to twenty-four hours,” alleges Powers. “But something that happens in the first 90 seconds suggests either potential advanced insider knowledge or some other possible explanation.”\nThe White House press office declined to comment. A request for comment delivered to the email address listed on the TRUMP website went unanswered.\nTRUMP is pitched as a memecoin, a type of cryptocurrency that typically serves no purpose, promises no utility, and has no underlying business model. The price of a memecoin tends to swing violently with the caprices of the public mood.\nIn the memecoin trading game, getting in early is everything. “There’s no fundamental value in any of these coins, so it’s about just being very, very early,” says Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at the blockchain analytics company Nansen, which analyzed patterns in the trading data for WIRED.\nThe crypto wallets that invested the largest sums in TRUMP largely purchased the coin on January 18, the day it launched, according to Nansen analysis. The wallets that achieved the greatest return on their TRUMP investments, meanwhile, had largely sold off their holdings by January 20, by which time the price had already tumbled from its peak. The circulating TRUMP coins are now valued at $5.4 billion.\n“The earlier you are, the more you can bet. But if you’ve bet a lot, it doesn’t make sense to stay a long time, because it’s not going to be [the next] Apple or Nvidia,” says Barthere. “There is zero value. So for sure it’s going to go down.”\nAmong the wallets that have profited most handsomely from TRUMP, Nansen data shows, are many that dealt in comparatively small sums, which implies that some regular people managed to beat the crowd in the same way as the big early traders. In the midst of the high-value trades placed by J9tXv and others in the minutes after TRUMP launched, armchair traders were throwing down as little as 50 bucks.\nBeyond an incredible stroke of fortune and gall, Sibenik and Powers claim, only one other theory could explain traders plowing hundreds of thousands of dollars into TRUMP so soon after it was unveiled: The trades were placed by automated sniping bots.\nSniping bots are typically programmed to snatch up multiple different coins immediately after launch, says Powers. Some of the wallets used to place the early high-value TRUMP trades do contain tens of other memecoins, but others, including J9tXv, contain only a few.\n“What we would not expect to see from a bot would be an acquisition of one token only with a large position, especially if that token hadn’t been previously announced. That activity seems too specific,” says Powers. “How do you code the script for a bot to acquire one token before you know it exists?”\nMost sniping bots are also programmed to deal in smaller dollar amounts, says Sibenik. “[The big early traders] either being insiders or having insight from another party are more likely explanations, especially given the very large amounts invested,” Sibenik says.\nIn the absence of any rules governing memecoins in the US, it may not necessarily be illegal for an issuer to give early notice to select parties.\nRecently, multiple federal lawsuits brought by investors have sought to argue that memecoins should fall under securities laws, governed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a regulatory agency tasked with protecting US investors. But in an interview on January 23, venture capitalist David Sacks, appointed by Trump as the US AI and crypto czar, claimed that memecoins should be treated as a type of collectible, an unregulated asset class.\nIn an executive order signed on January 23, Trump established a “working group on digital assets,” which he tasked with recommending appropriate crypto-related regulation and legislation.\n“The cryptocurrency industry is still driving for clarity on regulation. The major players want to be seen as good faith actors in financial markets,” says Powers. “There has been some disgruntlement expressed from within the [crypto] industry of this memecoin offering seeming to take advantage of the moment.”\nAt the foot of the TRUMP website, a small-print disclaimer asserts that the memecoin is “not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.” The terms and conditions, meanwhile, stipulate that investors must waive the right to bring a class action lawsuit in relation to the memecoin. They also claim that investors are not entitled to pursue damages, even in the event of “deceptive and unfair trade practices” and “misrepresentation” on the part of the Trump-affiliated company administering the coin.\n“That’s a stunning caveat,” says Powers. “Whether those kinds of waivers and disclaimers would actually hold up in court is another matter. But setting down the road with that attitude is not in keeping with the hope of the crypto industry to turn the page on what came before.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is still wrapped in mystery. Its recent reveal teased a few details—a larger overall design, redesigned Joy-Con controllers, backward compatibility, and what's likely to be Mario Kart 9 as a launch title among them—but Nintendo remains tight-lipped about hardware specifications, services, and how the overall experience will improve on the existing, ultra-successful Switch console.\nNintendo is playing it safe, and while more details are set to be revealed in a dedicated Nintendo Direct broadcast on April 2, there are undoubtedly areas where the upcoming console could improve on its predecessor. Here are just five things I think the Switch 2 needs to succeed.\nBetter Online Services\nWhile Nintendo has already done some housekeeping on this front—gone are the nightmare days of coexisting Nintendo Network IDs and Nintendo Accounts—there's still much the company could do to improve its digital services.\nFirstly, its eShop store for buying games is in need of a major overhaul. On the current Switch, it's messy, slow, and a chore to navigate. What should be simple browsing tools—exploring by genre, for instance—are buried under the search tab, and there's no way to sort titles alphabetically, only by relevance, popularity, release date, or price orders.\nThe web browser experience is even worse—access the eShop through Nintendo.com and you get what looks more like an info page than a storefront. Scroll down and click through to any of the categories to find some games and you'll discover an interface so dated it lets you filter for games available on the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, platforms that haven't been purchasable since March 2023. Although the Nintendo Switch still enjoys a relatively strong showing for physical game sales, industry analyst Mat Piscatella says 53 percent of Switch game sales between January and August 2024 were digital. Discovery and exploration of Nintendo's digital storefront simply has to improve.\nThen there's Nintendo Switch Online, its subscription service. This is Nintendo's equivalent to PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass, and like its competitors, it unlocks online multiplayer support. It also offers access to a curated selection of retro titles from the NES, SNES, and Game Boy (plus more from N64, Game Boy Advance, and even former rival Sega Mega Drive/Genesis for those with the bolted-on Expansion Pack membership).\nThe Switch 2 has the chance to do two pretty cool things here. One, expand that retro selection, bringing in titles from the GameCube era—and rumors of a return of the GameCube controller indicate Nintendo may be gearing up to do exactly that. Two, bring back the ability, last seen on Wii U, to buy digital downloads of past-gen games outright. This would allow Nintendo to potentially cycle the selection of games included in the NSO catalog, as Sony and Microsoft do with their subscriber-only libraries, and allow Switch 2 owners to build a multigenerational collection all on one console. That would tie in nicely with Nintendo's approach to backward compatibility for Switch 2, which brings us to …\nBoosted Backward Compatibility\nIt's no secret that some Nintendo Switch games struggle with the limitations of running on eight-year-old hardware. Switch games are rarely the most visually astounding on a technical level, although developers often work near-miracles with smart art direction, crafting worlds full of wonder and charm. Still, when even some of Nintendo's own biggest titles are notably underperforming in matters of frame rate, draw distances, and textures—the last couple of core Pokémon games, Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet being particularly egregious examples—there's a problem.\nIt's a problem the Switch 2 could potentially solve if the new hardware's backward compatibility can improve the performance of original Switch games in the process. However, if implemented, it's unlikely this would be a magic wand where more onboard processing and rendering power instantly gives older games a fresh lick of digital paint. As with Sony's PS5 Pro, where games need bespoke patches from the developer to make use of the beefier hardware, the same may be the case for Switch 2 to “upgrade” Switch 1 games.\nThat would put the onus on developers to ensure that games can take advantage of any enhancements the Switch 2 offers. But if done well—avoiding Sony’s mistakes when its PS5 Pro patches initially made games look worse—boosting backward compatibility could make Switch 2 the definitive home to at least two generations of gaming greatness.\nImproved Screen Resolutions\nThat's resolutions, plural. The current Switch has a 1280 x 720-pixel resolution display in handheld mode, rising to a maximum of 1920 x 1080 when docked and outputting to a TV. The Switch 2 needs to go higher, in every sense. In a world of handheld gaming PCs such as the Asus ROG Ally X with 1080p screens or the Lenovo Legion Go offering up to 2560 X 1600 resolution, the Switch 2 needs to deliver a minimum of 1080p Full HD in handheld mode.\nDocked, that 1080p needs to leap to 4K, 3840 x 2160 pixels. If you've bought a new TV in the last five to 10 years, it's almost certainly built for that resolution, so anything less from the Switch 2 will feel antiquated. I could see some flexibility on this point, though. While “true” 4K would be nice—perhaps unlocked with some extra processing power built into the dock itself, which could allow the console to render in Ultra HD—given that Nintendo rarely plays the numbers game in the same way Sony or Microsoft do, upscaled 4K would probably be broadly acceptable to most players. The PS4 Pro, which the Switch 2 is rumored to be roughly on par with, achieved some impressive results with 4K upscaling, so it'd be nice to see the Switch 2 match this benchmark.\nBring Back Media Apps\nThe Switch launched with no media apps at all and, throughout its life, Nintendo added only a handful like YouTube, anime streaming service Crunchyroll, Hulu in the US, and Niconico in Japan. This was partly down to Nintendo's intentional strategy that the Switch is not a multimedia device—Reggie Fils-Aimé, then chief operating officer at Nintendo of America, said in 2017 that it was built “to be a world-class gaming device, meaning we want you first and foremost to play games on the system.” Still, there's no denying that access to streaming apps on a console is convenient.\nIt's not as though the idea is alien to Nintendo. The Wii U had a native Netflix app, and the Wii even had a dedicated BBC iPlayer app in the UK. The Wii U also saw Nintendo dabble with integrated TV services with its Nintendo TVii tool combining content providers into one portal. The demand is there too, with fans still asking for streaming services on the existing Switch.\nWhile the Switch 2 will still likely chase that ideal of being a “world-class gaming device,” the upcoming console's bigger screen makes it particularly enticing to imagine watching your favorite shows or movies on the go. Nintendo really shouldn't rule it out.\nMore New Games\nThis is the big one. A major factor in the original Switch's success was the failure of its own predecessor, the Wii U. Approximately 47 people bought one (OK, more than 13 million people, but that's a far cry from the 101 million Wii owners or the 146 million and counting who've bought a Switch), which meant a lot of people missed out on some genuinely great games that launched on the console. The likes of Mario Kart 8, Super Mario 3D World, and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker provided Nintendo with a ready-made pool of titles to port to the Switch, where most players first discovered them.\nThat tactic won't work again. For one, the well is drier—even cult favorite titles such as Xenoblade Chronicles X, The Wonderful 101, and Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE (a crossover between Atlus' Shin Megami Tensei and Nintendo's Fire Emblem series) have made the transition to Switch. Even older console generations have been tapped for modern ports, with the likes of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Metroid Prime coming to Switch from GameCube (the latter, at least, significantly upgraded as Metroid Prime Remastered). While it could continue looking further back into its archives for more remasters—Zelda fans are still crying out for modern, accessible versions of The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess, for example—the older the source material, the more effort is required to remaster or remake it for present-day tech.\nWith the Switch 2's backward compatibility, there's also less need to revive games from the preceding generation. Millions of people will have already played, say, Luigi's Mansion 3 and will still be able to play it on Switch 2—a rerelease would feel redundant. There isn't that pool of easily accessible, largely overlooked, and reasonably easy-to-port content waiting for Switch 2 that there was for the original Switch.\nInstead, the Switch 2 needs to go hard on brand-new games, to a degree not seen for years. Nintendo shouldn't see this as an obstacle but an opportunity. While we'll assuredly see fresh entries for its flagship series—Super Mario, Pokémon, Super Smash Bros—the company sits on a gold mine of IP with baked-in audiences who have been waiting years, if not literal decades, for new entries.\nSure, we're already guaranteed a new Mario Kart on Switch 2, but there hasn't been a big-budget, full-scale F-Zero since 2003. That series delivers an entirely different type of racing action, so it's surely time for Captain Falcon to take another lap, especially considering the futuristic racer was one of the few in the genre to incorporate something of a story mode. Or Star Fox—the anthropomorphic space shooter last appeared with 2016's Star Fox Zero (one of the few Wii U games not to get a Switch rerelease), so a return is overdue. Donkey Kong hasn't had a new adventure in a decade; Kid Icarus in 13 years. 1080° Snowboarding hasn't taken to the slopes in 22. Let's see some of those titles brought back for brand-new outings.\nYet even more exciting than the revival of long-dormant properties is the potential the Switch 2 has to bring entirely new gaming experiences to the console. If rumors of the next-gen Joy-Con controllers having mouse-like features turn out to be true—and Nintendo has prior form on this, with the likes of the SNES Mouse—then it opens the door for Switch 2 to more authentically present everything from grand strategy games to point-and-click adventures, genres that rarely translate well to joypad controls.\nAnother factor that will boost Switch 2's game library is the confirmation that Microsoft will be supporting the console. While no games have yet been confirmed, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Diablo 4, and even Microsoft Flight Simulator are rumored to be coming to Nintendo's new console. Call of Duty is also likely to make an appearance in some capacity, given the franchise will continue to see multiplatform releases despite Microsoft buying publisher Activision.\nIf done well, the Switch 2 could be as diverse a platform as the PC is for gaming—and if Nintendo serves up some of the other points on our wish list, it could outshine even the original Switch.",

This was partly down to Nintendo's intentional strategy that the Switch <em>is not</em> a multimedia device—Reggie Fils-Aimé, then chief operating officer at Nintendo of America, said <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/08/nintendos-u-s-ceo-responds-to-our-biggest-gripes-with-the-switch/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/08/nintendos-u-s-ceo-responds-to-our-biggest-gripes-with-the-switch/\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/08/nintendos-u-s-ceo-responds-to-our-biggest-gripes-with-the-switch/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in 2017</a> that it was built “to be a world-class gaming device, meaning we want you first and foremost to play games on the system.” Still, there's no denying that access to streaming apps on a console is convenient.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It's not as though the idea is alien to Nintendo. The Wii U had a native Netflix app, and the Wii even had a dedicated BBC iPlayer app in the UK. The Wii U also saw Nintendo dabble with integrated TV services with its <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Network#Nintendo_TVii\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Network#Nintendo_TVii\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Network#Nintendo_TVii\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo TVii</a> tool combining content providers into one portal.

Nintendo really shouldn't rule it out.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">More New Games</h2><p class=\"paywall\">This is the big one. A major factor in the original Switch's success was the failure of its own predecessor, the Wii U. Approximately 47 people bought one (OK, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">more than 13 million people</a>, but that's a far cry from the 101 million Wii owners or the 146 million and counting who've bought a Switch), which meant a lot of people missed out on some genuinely great games that launched on the console. The likes of <em>Mario Kart 8, Super Mario 3D World,</em> and <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em> provided Nintendo with a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-games/\">ready-made pool of titles</a> to port to the Switch, where most players first discovered them.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Courtesy of Nintendo</span></div></figure></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "In his new memoir, Bill Gates doesn’t mention any study of William Wordsworth’s writings. But when I read Source Code: My Beginnings, I thought of the English poet’s famous line from 1802: “The child is father of the man.” Nearly the entire volume is devoted to Gates’ early years, with Microsoft’s origin story entering the narrative in the final chapters. (A second volume will discuss his company, and a third will focus on his work with the Gates Foundation.)\nIn more than 40 years of interactions with Gates, I have found him resistant to self-reflection. He’d often mock my attempts to engage him in a deep biographical mode by making flip comments or dodging the question. But in this book—his fifth—released this February, there are about 300 pages of Bill Gates’ personal journey, told in a somewhat unsparing first person.\nAs he paints it, Gates’ Seattle childhood hit all the notes of a ’50s sitcom, with loving, devoted parents and the trappings of the American Dream. But the family dynamic was fraught, often because of Gates’ personality quirks. His own father once told me that Gates’ mom found their son’s behavior “traumatic”—he refused to submit to his parents’ wishes that he do his homework, listen to simple requests, or even speak to them. With his family, his teachers, and his fellow students, Gates rejected the social contract. He cracked jokes or responded with sarcasm and his favorite phrase, “That’s the stupidest thing I ever heard!” (Those words would later be as familiar to his employees at Microsoft as they were in the hallways of Seattle’s Lakeside School.)\nAt Lakeside, Gates learned that actually studying for class could pay dividends, and that acting in a school play was a great way to get to know popular girls (though one turned him down for a prom date). Most importantly, he discovered that a computer terminal could open up a world to him—and ultimately, with his software, to hundreds of millions of others.\nGates’ description of how he and his friend Paul Allen cofounded Microsoft is a more familiar tale. It was the subject of my very first interview with Gates in April 1983, and in my book Hackers I told the story (as did others) of how, when Gates was 19, the pair created the first version of the BASIC computer language that ran on a microcomputer. But reading Gates’ side of the early Microsoft saga is illuminating. He explains why after commandeering a 60 percent stake in the company, he later browbeat Allen into accepting the butt end of a 64-36 split. Gates says he now feels badly about how he handled it, but that the arrangement reflected who was working harder and making more decisions. (In his own autobiography, Idea Man, Allen would write that the incident “exposed the differences between the son of a librarian and the son of a lawyer.”)\nGates and I met at the Washington, DC, office of Breakthrough Energy, an organization he founded in 2015 to help fund climate tech. The former teenage hellion—who once joked with a friend how crazy it would be to accumulate a $15 million fortune—is now a 69-year-old world-famous centibillionaire and a divorced granddad with his own complex family dynamic. He is respected by the global health establishment and literally demonized by anti-vaxxers and tinfoil paranoids. He has been interviewed thousands of times and sits stone-faced as he mics up for our session. But as he reimmerses himself in the past, he soon is rocking gently—and cracking jokes.\nI know you’ve been thinking of an autobiography for decades. But I didn’t expect you to write a book about your childhood.\nIt’s a project I’ve been working on for some time. But it was only about 18 months ago that I decided to do a book on this first phase of my life—the 25 years up to the start of Microsoft—where my parents, my upbringing, and the luck I was exposed to were the whole story. Once that idea came up, I got quite enthused. It was really fun to try and explain how amazing my father was, my mother, my sisters. And how I found myself more enmeshed in programming than almost anyone by the time I’m about 20 years old.\nThis is very much a bildungsroman, your coming-of-age story. You hold a mirror to yourself. Sometimes the mirror doesn’t portray such a flattering image.\nIt’s not the Immaculate Conception. I had my ups and downs. There was the time I brought friends to the Harvard lab and used a computer, and they were confused about what I was doing. [He was later admonished for improper use of the lab.] Microsoft’s first customer was MITS, and we ended up in a dispute with them. It’s hopefully a very human story.\nIt is a human story. I remember doing a profile of you in 1999, and your father told me that your mother was traumatized by your behavior. You wouldn’t talk for days on end. As you say in the book, the things that really interested you were reading and math and being inside your own head. In some ways you weren’t kind to your parents, and you express remorse for this.\nI give my parents a lot of credit for how they shaped me. My dad was much more setting an example, always being serious about his work. With my mom, it was far more intense. I was often falling short. “Oh, you didn’t get up here as soon as I wanted, or your table manners weren’t as good as I wanted.” She was always pushing me to do better. Eventually she was proud of what I achieved, but that was a complex relationship.\nThey were at their wits’ end with you, and took you to a therapist. At the end of the book you said that if you had grown up in this era, you probably would have been diagnosed on the autism spectrum. What led you to that conclusion?\nBack then, the idea that kids were very different and needed some kind of intervention wasn’t commonplace at all. I was clearly somewhat hyperactive. I could concentrate a great deal. This guy, Dr. Cressey, really got me thinking about what I was trying to achieve in this conflict with my parents. Did I really have some thought in mind, or was I just trying to make trouble? I think the fact I did get to see that therapist was good. Who knows what it would have been like if I’d been diagnosed? Kids now are much more looked over. I was able to go off to the computer center or spend all that time alone, even going out on hikes.\nI couldn’t believe how you and your preteen friends went on epic, dangerous, multi-day hikes.\nNow you’d have a GPS tracker.\nVery late in the book you acknowledge how much privilege is part of your story. You say that you were advantaged as a white male, and your family was well off. But in a sense your life is charmed. Everyone is watching out for you. At several points your father swoops in to give you legal help. Teachers went out of their way to take an interest in you. People had your back at every turn.\nI was so lucky in those things. I had at least five or six teachers who saw a spark in me and really engaged with me. My parents were well off, but compared to the kids at this private school I’d say we were below average. They had bigger houses and they had wealth. [This wasn’t apparent to Paul Allen, who wrote in his book, “Bill came from a family that was prominent even by Lakeside standards … I remember the first time I went to Bill’s big house a block or so above Lake Washington, feeling a little awed.”] I actually had a little chip on my shoulder—“Hey, you guys, your parents gave you a car and you didn’t have to work in the summer.” But you could hardly design a better childhood, you know—including a time-sharing computer terminal showing up at the school when I’m 13 years old.\nYou recount how you acted like the class clown and often responded to people by being, as you diplomatically say, a “smart aleck.”\nLook, there’s a certain clever-boy shortcut use of sarcasm that allows you to communicate efficiently. That whole kind of sparring can be funny. At Harvard, that was my go-to approach, my whole way of engaging with people—procrastination, and being super clever and sarcastic while tearing somebody’s argument apart. The underlying skill is actually worthwhile, but I tended to break those habits later, knowing when not to deploy it. That kind of dialog doesn’t work when you’re managing people.\nWell, I’m thinking about the deposition you gave as a billionaire CEO before the trial for antitrust—you behaved just like a smart aleck kid!\nYou think I was a smart aleck? That lawyer, now that’s a smart aleck!\nMalcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers says that it’s possible to explain why some people are special. They practice at their special skill for 10,000 hours and are alive at the perfect time for their expertise to matter. You certainly spent more than 10,000 hours programming, and the time was right. But that’s true of a lot of people. And there is only one Bill Gates. I can’t crack the code for what makes a person extraordinary. Have you thought about that?\nIt’s not just the circumstances, though that’s gigantic. Yes, there’s still a few million kids who are in the same loop as I am. But through my father I saw the common sense of business. In my early engagement with Digital Equipment Corporation, which was this vaunted company, people embraced me and gave me reinforcement. And there’s something about my desire to succeed using my skill set. My friend Kent Evans helped really cement that.\nHe was your best friend, and more focused on his ambition than you were, reading business magazines as a teenager. His accidental death at age 17 haunts this book, and your life.\nKent helped shape me as a forward-looking person. And then Paul was reading about chip stuff, and he showed it to me. He was two years ahead of me but he sought me out.\nPaul also gave you LSD. Steve Jobs once said that LSD was a formative experience and opened his mind in a way that helped him with creativity and design. I don’t get the impression that taking acid was life-changing for you.\nI think the batch that Steve got must have really been good for product design and marketing. My God, just think if I’d had that batch! Yeah, I did some crazy things when I was young. Paul deserves some credit for that. By the time we got serious about work, we weren’t doing that anymore.\nYou also briefly write about the famous time you got busted for speeding. Were you freaked out by spending a night in jail?\nNo, it was just kind of a funny thing. They thought it was strange that somebody so young had a nice car—what was the story with this kid? Was I a drug dealer or something?\nYou bought yourself a Porsche in your early twenties.\nI clearly didn’t fit their normal pattern. We kept enough cash around that Paul was able to come down and bail me out.\nSpeaking of cash, on the recent Netflix series you host, you did an episode about inequality. You didn’t condemn the idea of billionaires but advocated for more equality. How would that work?\nThe world economy has created some hyper-rich people. Like me. And maybe 50 or 60 others. Elon Musk is at the head of that list, but with Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Ballmer, Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg, there’s a lot of people with a stunning level of wealth. I think that’s OK. I would have a much more progressive tax system, so I would have about a third as much money as I have. It would still be a gigantic fortune.\nThe New York Times reported that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is on track to avoid $8 billion in estate taxes. When you read that, did you think, “I should consult his tax lawyer”? Or say that this is not a good thing?\nI’m quite certain I’ve paid more taxes than anyone alive—over $12 billion. There are techniques I could have used, like to borrow against my Microsoft shares and not sell them. But if people are getting away with paying less in taxes in a legal way, blaming them is a little strange. We ought to change the tax system.\nThey are culpable because they use political pressure to preserve their loopholes and cut funding for the IRS.\nThe votes of these billionaires shouldn’t influence our tax system. Also, several of the 50 hyper-rich are for more progressive taxation. I’ve been surprised that even the Democratic Party hasn’t gone very far to make tax stuff more progressive. I’m a huge defender of the estate tax, I think it’s a fantastic thing. I would make it even tougher to avoid it.\nLet’s talk about artificial intelligence. You’ve been working with it for years, but you were slow to embrace the recent transformational breakthrough of generative AI. It wasn’t until OpenAI did a demo of GPT-4 at your home and aced an AP Biology test that you became bullish on it. What was the reason for your initial skepticism?\nThe idea of AI is pervasive throughout my whole history with computers. Bizarrely, when I left Harvard to start Microsoft, one of the things I thought I might regret was that the progress in AI in academia might move quickly while I was doing BASIC interpreters. That turned out to be so wrong. I expected that when we could encode knowledge in a rich way, where it could read a biology textbook and pass the AP exam, that we would explicitly understand how we’re encoding that knowledge. Instead, we discovered a weird statistical algorithm that we don’t understand. Why does GPT work? We don’t have a clue. But when OpenAI showed me GPT-4, it stunned me that they had crossed a very important threshold. We still have reliability problems, but we have a path now where I think those will all get solved.\nSam Altman says we will have AGI in the next few years. Do you agree?\nAbsolutely.\nWhat will that mean for us?\nAnybody who analogizes this to electricity, tractors, microcomputers, they don’t get it. This is not a productivity aid for humans. This is something that exceeds human capability. It is not bounded in any way, and it is happening very, very quickly. Just looking back on previous tech revolutions and saying, “OK, that all worked out,” is no guide for this one.\nDo we need to regulate it?\nRegulation will call for certain liability, for quality benchmarks. But the main thing people should say is, should we slow it down? It’s very hard to think how you would do that. Whenever somebody in the US says, OK, let’s regulate it, people say, “Well, what about other countries like China?” The key fact is, we don’t have a mechanism to slow it down.\nWe’re also developing weapons with it—there’s a literal arms race for lethal weapons controlled by AI. Do you think that’s a good idea?\nTake what Elon essentially said about the F-35 fighter jet—having a human in it is value subtracted. He’s right. So if you use the logic of, “OK, I want to make the best airplane weapon,” AI is the state of the art.\nWhat’s your relationship with the new administration? In an earlier interview, you told me that Donald Trump urged you and Anthony Fauci to meet with RFK Jr.\nWe did meet with him, and we discussed vaccine safety. It was four people—Robert Kennedy, [former National Institutes of Health director] Francis Collins, Tony Fauci, and myself—and we spent two and a half hours.\nAre you excited that he has been named to head the Department of Health and Human Services?\nDoes he end up taking the job or not? There are people excited that he is willing to shake things up. If you shook it up the right way, maybe it could be better. But I think the National Institutes of Health works very well the way it is. So my counsel, if they are at all interested, is to not be too radical in changes to the NIH. But they’re in charge. At the very least, it’s going to be an interesting period.\nAren’t you terrified that an anti-vaxxer is going to be in charge of vaccines?\nIt’s hard to know. Many radical things get said, and very few radical things get done. In the world of health you have to have an outcome. Are you helping to make people healthy or not? The Foundation’s unique point of view is that we want to help the health of people all over the world, including in poor countries. The thing that I’m most worried about is, will the health needs of the poorest, particularly in Africa, continue to be a priority? The desire to reduce the deficit makes us have to stick up for those things even though the stuff I’m trying to stick up for is only like half a percent of the budget.\nElon might think that’s a waste of money.\nI am worried about the relationship between the United States and the World Health Organization, since various people and politicians had complaints about the WHO during the pandemic. That should all be talked through. But I hope the US doesn’t defund WHO, because they play a very important role in coordinating things when there is a health emergency and preventing a pandemic. [In his first week in office—after this interview took place—President Trump announced that the US would leave the WHO.]\nAre you going to make nice with the Trump people?\nThey’re the government of the United States. So I would say yes.\nLet’s finish with the way you end your book. You write that sometimes you wish you were still that 13-year-old kid living inside your own head and driven by curiosity. With all your success, you really want to roll back the tape?\nI’m not saying I want to go back and change something. I’ve been so lucky. But it was amazing to live through all that. I do miss that wonderful feeling where the whole thing was in doubt. There were days when I thought, “Oh, we are so messed up, and other people are ahead of us.” And, “Who do we think we are to have these wild dreams?” But step by step, we built this incredible thing.\nDo people really change?\nNo. I think you moderate, you become wiser, and you grow. But I’m still 95 percent that same person.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

    "content_text": "For much of living memory, the United States has been a global leader of scientific research and innovation. From the polio vaccine, to decoding the first human chromosome, to the first heart bypass surgery, American research has originated a seemingly endless list of health care advances that are taken for granted.\nBut when the Trump administration issued a memorandum Monday that paused all federal grants and loans—with the aim of ensuring that funding recipients are complying with the president’s raft of recent executive orders—US academia ground to a halt. Since then, the freeze has been partially rescinded for some sectors, but it largely remains in place for universities and research institutions across the country, with no certainty of what comes next.\n“This has immediate impact on people’s lives,” says J9 Austin, professor of psychiatry and medical genetics at the University of British Columbia. “And it’s terrifying.”\nThe funding freeze requires agencies to submit reviews of their funded programs to the Office of Management and Budget by February 10. The freeze follows separate orders issued last week to US health agencies—including to the National Institutes of Health, which leads the country’s medical research—to pause all communications until February 1 and stop almost all travel indefinitely.\nThe confusion is consummate. If the funding freeze continues through February, and even beyond, how will graduate students be paid? Should grant applications—years long in the writing—still be submitted by the triannual grant submission deadline on February 5? What does this mean for clinical trials if participants and lab techs can’t be paid? Will all that research have to be scrapped thanks to incomplete data?\nEven if Trump fully reverses the freeze on research funding, the damage, multiple sources say, has been done. Although for now the funding freeze is temporary, the administration has shown how it might wield the levers of government. The implication is that withdrawing funding could be done more permanently, and could be done to individual institutions, individual organizations, both private and public. This won’t just set a precedent for the large East Coast or West Coast universities, but those located in both red and blue states alike.\nWhile always an imperfect arrangement, science in the US is largely funded by a complex system of grant applications, reviews by peers in the field (both of which have had to be halted as part of the communications pause), and the competitive distribution of NIH funds, says Gerald Keusch, emeritus professor of medicine at Boston University and former associate director of international research for the NIH. According to its website, the NIH disburses nearly $48 billion in grants per year.\nWhen it comes to medical research, America truly is first, and if it abdicates that position, the void left behind has global ramifications. “In Canada, we have always looked to NIH as an exemplar of what we should be trying to do,” says Austin, speaking to me independently of any roles and affiliations. “Now, that’s collapsed.”\nScience is, in its very nature, collaborative. Many consortiums and alliances within scientific fields cross borders and language barriers. Some labs may be able to find additional funding from alternative sources such as the European Union. But it is unlikely that a continued withdrawal of NIH funding could be plugged by overseas support. And Big Pharma, with its seemingly endless funds, is unlikely to step up either, according to sources WIRED spoke with.\n“This can’t be handed off to drug companies or biotech, because they’re not interested in things that are as preclinical as a lot of the work we’re discussing here,” says a professor of genetics who agreed to speak anonymously out of fear of retribution. “Essentially, there’s a whole legion of university-based scientists who work super damn hard to try to figure out some basic stuff that eventually becomes something that a drug company can drop $100 million on.”\nThe millions of dollars awarded to high-achieving labs is used to fund graduate students, lab techs, and analysts. If the principal investigator on a research team is unsuccessful in obtaining a grant through the process Keusch describes, often that lab is closed, and those ancillary team members lose their jobs.\nOne of the potential downstream effects of an NIH funding loss, even if only temporary, is a mass domestic brain drain. “Many of those people are going to go out to find something else to do,” the professor of genetics says. “These are just like jobs for anything else—we can’t not pay people for a month. What would the food service industry be like, for example, or grocery stores, if they don’t pay somebody for a month? Their workers will leave, and pharma can only hire so many people.”\nWIRED heard over and over, from scientists too fearful for their teams and their jobs to speak on the record, that it won’t take long for the impact to reach the general population. With a loss of research funding comes the closure of hospitals and universities. And gains in medical advancement will likely falter too.\nConditions being studied with NIH funding are not only rare diseases affecting 1 or 2 percent of the population. They’re problems such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s—issues that affect your grandmother, your friends, and so many people who will one day fall out of perfect health. It’s thanks to this research system, and the scientists working within it, that doctors know how to save someone from a heart attack, regulate diabetes, lower cholesterol, and reduce the risk of stroke. It’s how the world knows that smoking isn’t a good idea. “All of that is knowledge that scientists funded by the NIH have generated, and if you throw this big of a wrench in it, it’s going to disrupt absolutely everything,” says the genetics professor.\nWhile some are hopeful that the funding freeze for academia could end on February 1, when the pause on communications and therefore grant reviews is slated to lift, the individuals WIRED spoke with are largely skeptical that work will simply resume as before.\n“When the wheels of government stop, it’s not like they turn on a dime and they just start up again,” says Julie Scofield, a former executive director of NASTAD, a US-based health nonprofit. She adds that she has colleagues in Washington, DC, who have had funding returned to their fields, and yet remain unable to access payment through the management system.\nAustin says that already the international scientific community is holding hastily arranged online support groups. Topics covered range from the banal—what the most recent communication from the White House implies—to how best to protect trainees and the many students on international visas. But mostly they’re there to provide support.\n“I’ve had a lot of messages from people just expressing gratitude that we could actually get together,” Austin says. “There’s just so much unaddressable need. None of us has the answers.”\nScientists, perhaps more than any other profession, are trained to “learn and validate conclusions drawn from observation and experimentation,” says Keutsch. That applies to the current situation. And what they observe during this pause of chaos does not portend well for the future of the United States as a pinnacle of scientific excellence.\n“If people want the United States to head toward being a second-class nation, this is exactly what to do. If the goal is, in fact, to make America great, this is not a way to do it,” says the genetics professor. “This is not a rational, thoughtful, effective thing to do. It will merely destroy.”\nThis story has been written under a pseudonym, as the reporter has specific and credible concerns about potential retaliation.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe Barbie movie might feel like a distant memory at this point, but the collaborations somehow keep coming. The latest? There’s an official Barbie-branded G-Shock on the way.\nCasio has announced the watch as part of its 2025 lineup, and it’s every bit as bright, bold, and pink as you might imagine it to be … even if it isn't quite as out there as the Impala x Barbie Lightspeed inline skates.\nIt’s based on the popular GMA-S110 watch, a smaller version of the industrial-styled GA-110 that launched in 2010, and features a watch face that layers a number of small components to create a three-dimensional design.\nIn the GMA-S110BE, as the Barbie edition will be known, each of these components has a slightly different pink hue, along with some subtle themed variations. This includes a Barbie logo at 3 o’clock and a heart motif indicator on the inset dial at 9 o’clock.\nThe logo features again on the matching pink strap, while the case back is engraved with Barbie's trademark side profile silhouette.\nAway from the Barbie theme, you can expect all of the features of a regular GMA-S110, which means it is a mixed digital and analog watch, with 29 time zones across 48 cities. It features a shock-resistant structure, with 200-meter water resistance, and the option for five daily alarms, a 1/1,000-second stopwatch and countdown timer, plus an auto LED light.\nIt joins a trio of other pink-hued G-Shock watches launching this year —the GMA-P2100PP, GMD-S5610PP, and the GMA-S140PP—and Casio isn’t alone in betting big on pink once again in 2025. Oris has just announced the ProPilot X Miss Piggy Edition, for example, with its bright pink watch face taking its inspiration from everyone’s favorite Muppets diva (as well as a spyhole on the caseback revealing the character’s glamorous portrait), while Bremont has also launched the Terra Nova 38 in an eye-catching bubblegum pink—limited to 250 pieces.\nWhether this continuing penchant for pink is due to the Barbie effect, 18 months on from the movie's release, it's hard to be sure—but it feels unlikely. However Casio is clearly hoping that the Barbie branding still has some stiletto-wearing legs in it yet. Danielle Thom, the curator of the Design Museum's Barbie exhibition thinks its cross-generational pull is timeless.\n“A key reason for Barbie's appeal as a collaborator is the longevity of the brand, having been a dominant cultural presence since 1959,” she tells WIRED. “Rightly or wrongly, Barbie is also associated with a well-defined set of assumptions and values—femininity, accessible glamour, empowerment, and friendship. Any brand collaborating with Barbie can expect some of that magic to transfer over.”\nThe GMA-S110BE will be available in the US and Europe in March.",

    "content_text": "The recent installation of Elon Musk ally Thomas Shedd atop the federal IT structure has thrown an agency in charge of servicing much of the US government’s technical infrastructure into disarray.\nOver the last few days, workers at the Technology Transformation Services (TTS), which is housed within the General Services Administration (GSA), have been summoned into what one source called “sneak attack” meetings to discuss their code and projects with total strangers—some quite young—who lacked official government email addresses and have been reticent to identify themselves. TTS workers have also received confusing transition guidance and a sudden DC office visit from Musk.\nIt was announced last week that Shedd, who previously worked as a software engineer for eight years at Tesla, Musk’s electric car company, would be the new TTS director. In emails to TTS staff, Shedd reinforced the Trump administration’s commitment to cutting costs and maximizing efficiency—something Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has been charged with carrying out.\nAre you a current or former employee at GSA or other government tech worker? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters at makena_kelly@wired.com or vittoria_elliott@wired.com. You can also contact them more securely on Signal at makenakelly.32 or velliott88.18.\n“I’ve spent my entire career in Silicon Valley,” Shedd wrote in an introductory email to staff last Thursday and obtained by WIRED. “If we work together and execute well we will be able to navigate the policies, leverage our technical expertise and be a critical part of accelerating technology adoption across agencies to enable great gains in efficiency.”\nTTS helps develop the platforms and tools that underpin many government services, including analytics tools and API plugins that agencies can use to deploy tech faster. This means that the group has access to troves of government data and systems across agencies. That access is useful for standardizing the many, not always interoperable, systems that the federal government uses, but could also provide invaluable information to a private company or be weaponized against government employees and citizens.\nEarly Wednesday morning, rumors began to spread at TTS that employees would be receiving surprise one-on-one meeting notifications from management. During these brief meetings, employees would, according to a staff email that Shedd sent later on Tuesday, be asked to identify their biggest “wins” and the most significant “blockers” preventing them from working as efficiently as possible. The email linked to a Google Form questionnaire for employees to fill out ahead of their scheduled meetings. The invites included people without official GSA email accounts who were using Gmail addresses as well as official government accounts, multiple sources told WIRED.\n“These should be items that you completed,” a screenshot of the form obtained by WIRED said. “It is OK to have a mix of big projects and small wins (examples: fixed a critical bug, shipped XYZ feature, saved this amount on a renegotiated contract, ect [sic] … If you are an engineer or designer please include a link to a PR [pull request] or a screenshot of one of your wins from the past 3 months.”\nThe email is reminiscent of one that Musk sent early in his Twitter days, demanding that employees email a one-page description of what they had accomplished the previous month and how it differed from their goals.\nRather than convening with Shedd in these meetings, TTS employees were instead surprised to be met with people they had never seen or worked with before.\n“It was a very confusing call because I expected to be meeting you, and I was instead met by two people reluctant to identify themselves,” one TTS employee told Shedd in an open Slack channel, one of several reviewed by WIRED. “They had not seen the information I submitted in my form, so I was left trying to explain things without the visuals/links I had submitted,” one wrote.\n“Also had the same exact experience,” another employee added. “The individual I had met with had no idea about the google form I submitted and when I did reference it, I was met with avoidance.”\nIn a Slack message to TTS staff on Thursday morning viewed by WIRED, Shedd apologized for the vague and sudden meeting invites, and for including unnamed individuals in the meetings who joined with Gmail addresses.\n“They are each in the onboarding process of obtaining a GSA laptop and PIV card. I take full responsibility for the actions of each of them in the calls. I’ve asked them to start the calls with their first name and confirming that they are an advisor to me,” Shedd said in a screenshot of the Slack message viewed by WIRED.\nShedd told employees that the people on the calls were “vetted by me, and invited into the call.” He said they were physically present with him at the GSA headquarters, and that he had “badged them all into the building.” This implies that those joining the calls did not currently have official government IDs issued to agency staff.\nAt least two of these individuals appeared to be “college students with disturbingly high A-suite clearance,” one TTS source told WIRED. (A-suite clearances tie employees to the GSA administrator’s office.)\nOne person says they were brought into a review with Edward Coristine, a recent high school graduate who spent several months at Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company, whom WIRED has previously identified as a person working at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and reporting directly to its new chief of staff, the former xAI employee Amanda Scales. He has not responded to requests for comment from WIRED, and OPM has declined to comment.\n“We do not have any additional personnel announcements at this time.” a GSA spokesperson told WIRED on Thursday.\nIt’s typical for TTS workers to work in tandem with other agencies across government, with many of their projects containing data external to GSA and subject to sensitivity agreements. Being required to share specific technical achievements, though, spooked some employees who feared they could breach these agreements.\n“The team is correct in feeling nervous sharing details about other agencies in these calls and should continue to follow the normal guidance which is to not share sensitive information,” Shedd wrote in the GSA Slack on Thursday. “The point of these calls is to talk through interesting example problems/wins and dig into how that win was realized. A chance for you to brag about how you solved a problem.”\nThis week, it appears that TTS has become the primary target of these meetings, but members of the US Digital Services—which a Trump executive order has rebranded as Musk’s DOGE—also met with management to go over their recent work last week. The DOGE meetings were conducted similarly in structure to the TTS ones, according to The Washington Post.\nLike many other agencies, GSA has been making changes to DEI initiatives that have put workers on edge. On January 23, TTS deputy director Mukunda Penugonde announced that as part of the GSA’s new initiative to curtail DEIA programs, the agency would be shutting down its “Diversity Guild meeting series” and the “#g-diversity Slack channel effective today,” in an email reviewed by WIRED.\nMusk was seen at the GSA office near the White House on Thursday, but it’s unclear what he was doing there. Shedd was scheduled to lead a meeting with around 40 TTS program supervisors Thursday afternoon. On Wednesday, WIRED reported that Musk has been telling his friends that he’s been sleeping at the DOGE office in DC.\nOf all parts of the government, TTS, perhaps even more so than DOGE, is well positioned to get inside agencies’ technology and data, including government spending data, explaining why it’s such a focus for the new administration.\n“TTS represents the consolidation of 20-plus years of tech and data expertise, brought together by the hard work of hundreds (if not thousands) of civil servants,” Noah Kunin, a cofounder of 18F, a team of designers and engineers within the GSA that help government agencies build and deploy new tech products, and a former infrastructure director at GSA, tells WIRED. “They have the products, platforms, and people to do this work right, within the confines of current law, and fast.”",

    "content_text": "On Thursday morning, President Donald Trump appeared to place the blame for a midair collision that killed 67 people on the previous administration’s approach to hiring aviation professionals. But experts and investigators involved with the crash, which also involved a military helicopter, say the next few weeks will see investigators pore over every element of the crash, and the moments leading up to it, to determine the causes.\n“You need to give us time,” Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, said at a press conference Thursday. The NTSB is an independent US federal watchdog agency that is leading the investigation into the crash. “We have data, we have substantial amounts of information,” she said. “We need to verify information.”\n“We Will Analyze the Facts”\nOn Wednesday evening, a US Army Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter collided with the tail of a Bombardier CRJ-700 jet coming in for landing at Washington, DC’s Ronald Reagan National Airport. Officials say no one on board either the military helicopter or the commercial airliner, operated by the regional airline PSA Airlines on behalf of American Airlines, survived the crash. It is the deadliest US commercial airline crash in 16 years.\nIn a White House briefing Thursday morning, Trump pointed to a program that also existed through his first administration aimed at expanding the talent pool for the US Federal Aviation Administration to individuals with disabilities. There was no proof, he admitted, that the crash was linked to the FAA’s attempts to improve diversity in its workforce. But he made the connection, he said, “because I have common sense and unfortunately some people don’t.”\nLater on Thursday, the White House released a statement criticizing the Biden administration’s “rejection of merit-based hiring” at the FAA in favor of a hiring program that encouraged diversity. Trump also ordered the FAA and the US secretary of transportation to review all of the FAA’s hires and safety protocol changes made during the four years of the Biden administration, “and to take such corrective action as necessary to achieve uncompromised aviation safety,” which might include firings.\nBut experts and the investigators say a thorough and unbiased approach will be critical to determining exactly why and how the collision occurred.\nIn a press briefing, NTSB board member J. Todd Inman said at least seven different working groups will focus on different elements of the flights, made up of federal investigators as well as representatives from the military, aircraft manufacturers, and organizations representing aviation professionals.\nAn operations group will look into the history of the accident and the crew involved. Another group will focus on the body of the aircraft, examining the wreckage and accident scenes to determine what course the aircraft traveled before the collision, including the altitude. Another will zoom in on the engines involved. Others will examine onboard hydraulic, electrical, and pneumatic systems, as well as flight control instruments. A group will look specifically at the role of air traffic control, using recordings and sensor data to determine how professionals at National Airport reacted to the incident. Another will examine the reactions of first responders, and another will examine the helicopter in particular. A “human performance” group will be embedded within several of those organizations, focusing on what role crew fatigue, workload, medication, equipment, and training might have played in the collision.\nInman said the groups would produce a preliminary report on the crash in at least 30 days, but they would surface any pressing issues that might affect wider air safety as soon as they appear. “We will help find out what happened, and we will do it factually and accurately,” he said.\nAfter about a year, the NTSB will likely release a more in-depth report that includes recommendations for the entire air safety system. Officials at the FAA will then choose which of these recommendations to accept and implement.\n“Unbiased Minds”\nLooking at every part of a crash is standard operating procedure for crash investigations, says Daniel Kwasi Adjekum, who teaches aviation safety as a professor at the University of North Dakota. “In investigations, you should always have an unbiased mind,” he says. “You look at everything and rule it out.” That approach is critical, he says, to preserving the credibility of nonpolitical crash investigations. The taint of bias “makes it hard to call for substantial changes” after a tragic crash, he says.\n“Anybody who is rushing to judge or find fault right now is completely inappropriate,” says Michael McCormick, a former vice president of the FAA’s Air Traffic Organization who now coordinates the air traffic management program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. “Now is the time to allow the professionals to do their jobs.”\nNo matter what investigators find, the DC crash will very likely lead to significant changes in the way this country operates its aviation systems, McCormick says.\n“Having a midair collision occur in a major metropolitan area while both aircraft are being guided by air traffic control is an event that’s going to generate a lot of attention, a robust investigation, and some significant changes.”\nThe last serious crash that made him feel this certain about change was the 2009 Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash, which killed 50 people outside of Buffalo, New York, and resulted in the FAA adopting new safety procedures.

    "content_text": "Meta told investors on Thursday that it remains committed to building “an inclusive workplace” full of “cognitive diversity,” even as the social media company moves to end its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The statement was part of an annual earnings filing Meta made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in which it removed mentions of DEI-related “learning and development courses” for employees, as well as statistics on the percentage of staff who identify as disabled, LGBTQ+, or from other underrepresented backgrounds.\n“In early 2025, we announced changes to our diversity programs in light of the shifting legal and policy landscape,” Meta wrote in the filing. “We will continue to work to build an inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve.”\nThe filing, known as a 10-K, maintains language from Meta’s 2023 version about how “a broad range of knowledge, skills, political views, backgrounds, and perspectives” leads to cognitive diversity and “fuels innovation.” The world’s biggest social media company disclosed it has about 74,000 employees globally, up 10 percent from a year ago. Overall, Meta said it grew its daily active users by 5 percent to 3.35 billion in 2024, while sales increased by 22 percent to over $164 billion.\nTwo current Meta employees told WIRED they are still upset about the DEI rollbacks announced earlier this month and believe many of their colleagues share the same sentiments. Janelle Gale, the company’s vice president for human resources, said at the time that Meta was eliminating a program that aimed to ensure candidates from underrepresented groups in the tech industry weren’t overlooked in its hiring practices. Cuts were also announced to efforts that promoted Meta working with a diverse slate of outside vendors, such as businesses owned by military veterans or women, as well as to training programs designed to engender respect in the workplace among people with different backgrounds and abilities.\nMeta spokesperson Tracy Clayton declined to comment on the revisions to its SEC filing. The company did not immediately respond to a separate request for comment on the concerns raised by some employees.\nIn a note to staff earlier this month, Gale cited the changing US legal landscape that is “signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI.” She added that the term had “become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others.\"\nSome Meta employees say they have yet to notice any impacts internally. “I’m not convinced they are going to do anything at all. Could just remove mention of it and move on,” one staffer says. But the changes, which followed the relaxation of Meta’s hate speech policies for content shared on Instagram and Facebook, remain a constant source of discussion among workers, according to one of the employees.\nMeta employees typically vote on which questions executives should address at companywide meetings. Ahead of such a gathering scheduled for Thursday, several of the most-endorsed questions were related to DEI. But Meta leadership have told employees that the popularity of a certain question no longer guarantees that it will be answered by company leadership, according to one of the employees. The New York Times earlier reported the change.\nA number of US companies, including in the tech industry, removed mentions of diversity goals and programs in their annual filings about a year ago amid growing public criticism of the initiatives in the form of civil lawsuits and pressure from activist investors. A new round of cutbacks have been announced by retailers, restaurants, manufacturers, and tech developers as President Donald Trump returned to the White House this month.\nTrump has repeatedly criticized DEI policies and programs, calling them “nonsense” and “discriminatory.” After he was inaugurated on January 20, Trump quickly moved to end DEI programs at agencies across the federal government.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has sought to warm his once-frosty relationship with the president over the past few months. On Wednesday, Meta and Trump reached an agreement to settle a lawsuit Trump filed over the temporary suspension of his user account after the January 6 Capitol insurrection, according to a federal court filing. Meta agreed to pay about $25 million, with most of the funds going toward Trump’s future presidential library, The Wall Street Journal reported. Dani Lever, a Meta spokesperson, confirmed the reporting to WIRED. Trump’s attorneys in the case did not respond to requests for comment.\nZuckerberg didn’t acknowledge the settlement on the company’s quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, but did applaud the president. “We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad,” he said. “And I am optimistic about the progress and innovation that this can unwind.”\nAt Meta, the effect of the DEI cuts may be muted, in part, because the company has been working on trimming them for some time behind the scenes, according to a former Meta employee directly familiar with the changes. “It’s been a slow, painful death,” they say. After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, then chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg spearheaded the company’s increased commitments to diversity, including commissioning an internal civil rights audit. In its 2022 diversity report, Meta noted that it had doubled the number of women and Black staff members since 2019 as part of its diversity goals.\nWith Sandberg’s support, the former Meta employee says, “there was like this huge rush of energy to make a difference.” But in July 2022, Sandberg announced her departure from day-to-day operations at the company. Around that same time, the tech giant announced that it would start identifying teams to let go during upcoming widespread layoffs, which took place several months later. The eventual cuts affected some 11,000 people and were the first blow to Meta’s progress on diversity, the former employee alleges.\n“Managers who were on these DEI teams were forced to either convert to non-manager roles or move to other teams that weren’t DEI. Teams with DEI in their names were disbanded,” the former employee says. They further allege that after the layoffs, Meta stopped hosting quarterly leadership meetings to discuss progress on DEI goals.\nAsked about these allegations, Meta’s Clayton says the layoffs affected employees across the company.\nGot a Tip?\nDiversity advocates maintain that investing in DEI programs helps businesses perform better financially. Some companies, including Microsoft, have not announced recent changes to DEI programs or amended related sections in their SEC filings. This week, Netflix, one of the first major tech companies to publish its fourth quarter earnings report, bolstered its section on diversity. The company now says that it trains not only its recruiters, but also “our people leaders” on hiring “more inclusively.”\nThe streaming giant continues to state that diversity in the workplace is important to attracting subscribers. “We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen—so it’s important that our employee base is diverse and represents the communities we serve,” Netflix explains in its SEC filing. The company, which employs about 14,000 people, declined to further comment.",

Learn more.\nit wasn’t that long ago that one of Silicon Valley's most prominent and influential venture capitalists, Marc Andreessen, was a major supporter of the Democratic Party. So how did he, in such a short time, transform into a top adviser to the Trump administration? This week, we retrace Andreesen’s steps–from his early days at Netscape to his current role of “unpaid intern” at DOGE.\nYou can follow Michael Calore on Bluesky at @snackfight, Lauren Goode on Bluesky at @laurengoode, and Zoë Schiffer on Threads @reporterzoe. Write to us at uncannyvalley@wired.com.\nHow to Listen\nYou can always listen to this week's podcast through the audio player on this page, but if you want to subscribe for free to get every episode, here's how:\nIf you're on an iPhone or iPad, open the app called Podcasts, or just tap this link. You can also download an app like Overcast or Pocket Casts and search for “Uncanny Valley.” We’re on Spotify too.\nTranscript\nNote: This is an automated transcript, which may contain errors.\nMichael Calore: So, true or false? Silicon Valley is a liberal bastion.\nLauren Goode: Formerly true, currently false.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I would say the same. I feel like it's different whether you're talking to the really, really rich people in Silicon Valley or the rank-and-file workers, but there's definitely been, as New York Magazine would say, a vibe shift.\nMichael Calore: A big vibe shift, and obviously, a big part of that is the leaders of Silicon Valley, some of the CEOs and the billionaires we've been talking about on the show, and we're going to talk about another one of them today.\nLauren Goode: Let's do it.\nMichael Calore: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm Zoe Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nLauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: Today, we're talking about Marc Andreessen. He is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent venture capitalists. He's also the cofounder of the early web browser company Netscape, and until not that long ago, he was a top democratic donor, but in recent years, Andreessen has fully changed his political stripes. These days, he is an adviser to the Trump administration and has been helping recruit people from Silicon Valley to bring ideas into Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. He's even called himself the unpaid intern of DOGE.\nLauren Goode: How is he eating at night?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I feel like that's such a thing that's someone who's never been an unpaid intern would say, like, “Ha, ha, ha.”\nMichael Calore: Picture Andreessen eating a lot of ramen noodles, and I think you can get there. Now, Andreessen isn't just somebody with a long and successful career in tech. He's also a godfather-like figure in the industry who's known for setting the tone for the culture in Silicon Valley. So, how does Andreessen end up making a sharp turn toward the right in his fifties? How did he go from formerly supporting the Clintons, Gore, Kerry, and Obama, to being an essential part of Donald Trump's transition back into the Oval Office? Zoe, let's start this conversation with you. I want to ask you to tell us about Mark Andreessen's worldview.\nZoë Schiffer: Happily, and I will just say that we're going to slap a big “allegedly” onto every single comment that we make on this podcast, because in this here political climate, we should do that. OK, so I want to start by telling you about something that Mark Andreessen calls “the deal.” Have either of you heard about this?\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: Do you know what I'm talking about?\nLauren Goode: Enlighten us, please.\nZoë Schiffer: OK, so the deal is a concept that Mark Andreessen has talked about on a number of podcasts, including Honestly With Bari Weiss back in December.\nMarc Andreessen [archival audio]: The deal was somebody like me basically could start a company. You could invent a new technology, in this case, web browsers and all the other things that Netscape did. Everybody would think that that was great.\nZoë Schiffer: He says it's basically an unspoken agreement wherein if you're an entrepreneur and you make a company and that company does really, really well and you make a lot of money, and eventually you give all that money away, you are seen as an impressive figure in society and you enjoy a sterling reputation.\nMarc Andreessen [archival audio]: And then at the end of your career, you would be left with this giant pot of money, and then what you would do is donate it to philanthropy. That washes away all of your sins, reclassifies you as from a sort of suspect business mogul to a virtuous philanthropist, and that's the arc, and it's all great and wonderful.\nZoë Schiffer: And also, part of the deal is that you're a Democrat and you support Democratic causes. You accept the fact that you are going to be taxed at a pretty high rate, but it's kind of all worth it because, again, you're enjoying enormous wealth and people look up to you.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, and he talks often about the fact that you're just making so much money that you're not even really thinking about taxes and you're not even really thinking about the last chapter of your life. You're just collecting 10X profits on everything.\nLauren Goode: Is the idea that you have this sterling reputation predicated on the fact that you are giving your money away? What happens if you're just a billionaire who hoards it?\nZoë Schiffer: I think that in his mind, it's like society treats entrepreneurship as a good. Capitalism isn't seen as an evil, and so you're already kind of an impressive figure in society, but then the fact that you're giving some of this money away kind of ensures that when you die, everyone's like, look at what an incredible person that was.\nLauren Goode: Got it. OK.\nZoë Schiffer: Except he says that during Obama's second term, this starts to break down a little bit. Marc takes pains to say that he actually supported and voted for Obama. He really liked him during his first term. You guys will remember that Obama's campaign had used social media pretty effectively to bring him to the White House, and this was also around the time of the Arab Spring. So the tech industry was getting a lot of positive coverage for its perceived influence on democratic revolutions around the world, but suddenly, the vibe inside the tech companies, and particularly some of the companies that Marc invested in and was really involved in starts to shift, because employees are coming in and they're asking really pointed questions to the executive team. They're getting really mad about the tech companies working with the government on AI projects, and drones, and things that they feel like run counter to the liberal ethos of Silicon Valley. Marc starts to feel, along with a lot of other tech elites, that there's this sense that suddenly they're not seen as the good guys. If you're a white man, a capitalist, those are evil words, and he feels like everyone's essentially turning on him.\nLauren Goode: So is the deal referring to this time period that includes Obama's first term in the early 2010s?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I think the deal is the unspoken agreement that used to be in place for entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, and then the deal broke down and there was this big vibe shift where it was like you doing all of the things that a successful entrepreneur was supposed to do were suddenly seen as bad things.\nMarc Andreessen [archival audio]: Then the thing that really shook me was when I realized that the philanthropy was being redefined as evil.\nZoë Schiffer: Then he actually cites the fact that Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan were going to give away 99 percent of their wealth, a fact that they would've been lauded for historically, but suddenly they're being criticized.\nMarc Andreessen [archival audio]: They just got hammered with criticism and attacks on that, and the line of argument was literally, oh, they're just slimy rich people, and they're only doing it for the tax break.\nZoë Schiffer: To Marc Andreessen, he's like, whoa, the deal has completely broken down, and so this is what started to change his worldview.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, completely.\nZoë Schiffer: When Trump is elected in 2016, there is this kind of major reckoning in Silicon Valley. The public people in Washington and tech employees felt like social media was to blame for Trump's rise specifically, because these companies hadn't done enough to combat disinformation and foreign influence. Honestly, the research I've looked at suggests that just isn't really true. Those things are just less influential than people previously believed, and Marc Andreessen and others definitely didn't buy it at the time either. Andreessen starts to feel like he was lied to by the media. His views really start to shift.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, it's interesting, Zoë, that you say that. I think we all thought that social media was definitely to blame for that time period. I happened to listen to the Upstream podcast when we were preparing for this episode, and Andreessen went on that podcast a couple of years ago to talk about how that time period around 2015, 2016, how it, I'm quoting, “broke his mental model of the world.” He says that things started to change for him as far back as 2012 when he says that people in authority started saying things that just didn't make sense to him. Then with Trump winning the nomination and the general election in 2016, also he mentions Charlottesville, the George Floyd moment, January 6th, 2021, basically, a whole bunch of events in society that changed the political spectrum. He does say, “Look, as you get older, you don't know if it's the world changing or you are changing,” but basically, he lost all faith in his ability to understand politics. It's funny because I think we talked about this in the Sam Altman episode too. He did what rich men with some extra time do, which is he went on a reading journey.\nMarc Andreessen [archival audio]: So, I decided to read my way out in both directions, both all the way out to the left, all the way to Lenin and Marx and communism on the one hand, and then all the way out to the right on the other hand, and see if I could at least reconstruct a worldview for at least some sense of context for what's happening today.\nLauren Goode: At that time, this is 2022, when he did this Upstream interview, he says he's somewhere in the middle. He acknowledges that he's a prime beneficiary of globalization, says he also works in an industry that's been incredibly enriched by immigration, but you can also get a sense from this podcast at this time that he's starting to get tired of some of the messaging and the social demands of the left.\nZoë Schiffer: I feel like we're going to get trolled for talking a lot about other podcasts on our podcast, but let me just say that it is journalism to listen to these extremely long interviews. Oh, my gosh, we're not just looking at the clips.\nLauren Goode: I know. Can I just say, I used to really enjoy my walks along Ocean Beach and now I'm just like, well, let me pull up another three-hour podcast.\nMichael Calore: Honestly, if you're going to get inside of the mind of somebody like Marc Andreessen who is constantly thinking about 18 different things at once, then listening to him talk for a couple of hours is a good way to get a very complete picture of where his mind is at.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, absolutely, or at least as complete of a picture as we're likely to get.\nMichael Calore: So, through the Biden administration, Marc Andreessen was meeting with the White House in his capacity as a venture capitalist in order to help steer government regulation into territory that would be more favorable to his investments, and things really started to shift with his relationship with Biden. Were there specific issues that they weren't seeing eye to eye on?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, for sure, but one thing that has really stuck out to me when we've been listening to Marc Andreessen talk about these meetings and the issues that they were fighting over is, I guess it's obvious that billionaires meet with high-ranking government officials, but every time I hear it, I'm like, oh, wow, I guess that is how the world works. They're just sitting down talking about their grievances. They get the direct line to the White House.\nLauren Goode: They're talking about memecoins, basically.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, that's what they do. Literally though, Lauren, that seems to be what's happening. So yeah, the three areas that the Biden administration and the Marc Andreessens of the world seemingly really do not see eye to eye on are content moderation, crypto, and AI. So, with content moderation, Mark Zuckerberg has talked about this a lot recently, but there's this sense that the Biden administration is calling tech companies, putting pressure on them, this is actually called job owning, to take down posts or suppress certain narratives. Marc Andreessen, he's implied that he's quite uncomfortable with this. Then with the crypto industry in particular, Marc says that the Biden administration starts a terror campaign against crypto, and this is obviously personal, because his venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has 7.6 billion in crypto assets, and Biden's doing things like issuing executive orders, directing federal agencies to assess the risks of crypto. He appoints SEC chair Gary Gensler, who ramps up crypto enforcement actions pretty significantly, and then the real breaking point is with AI, so leading into the 2024 election between Biden and Trump, Marc Andreessen again has these closed-door meetings, he says, with the Biden administration, and they say that they're going to get very involved in AI. They're basically, according to Marc, not going to allow AI startups to flourish, they're going to have just a few big tech companies that are doing AI, and the government will basically control them. Sam Altman has come out publicly and said this is not his view of those meetings, which he apparently maybe attended, but Marc is like, we cannot allow this to happen. We have to come out in full force for Donald Trump, and that is what he does.\nMichael Calore: Another one of Marc Andreessen's keywords is \"debanking\".” He talks about this a lot when we hear him on podcasts and he blogs about it. What is debanking? What's he talking about?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, so debanking, this is the process wherein if you're a crypto company or an entrepreneur, you're cut off from the US banking system. So, literally, you'll have a bank account and then the bank will close that account. You might have to go to a cash economy, and sometimes the banks will literally say, according to Marc, that they're facing regulatory pressure from the US government, and so they need to cut off business. Of course, from the bank's perspective, they'll say that crypto has a track record of scams and fraud, and working with these companies exposes you to a lot of risks that could harm the bank and other customers, but it's a pretty personal issue for Marc Andreessen and his friends, obviously, and he says it's ruined people's lives, people that he knows specifically. He cites 30 founders backed by Andreessen Horowitz who have been debanked.\nLauren Goode: So, it sounds like what's really changed Marc Andreessen's worldview, to bring it back to Mike's original question, over the past several years … A couple things, and one is this reaction from society collectively to the incredible power and wealth of some of these tech folks and this shifting idea around tech entrepreneurs as rock stars. That's one thing, and then the second part is he just really, really doesn't like some of the regulatory efforts of this most recent administration in particular around crypto and AI.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, exactly.\nMichael Calore: All right. So, now we're up to speed on where Marc Andreessen's mind is in 2025. Let's take a break, and when we come back, we'll go back in time and examine how he got into his position of power in Silicon Valley. You're listening to Uncanny Valley.\n[break]\nMichael Calore: So, let's back up and talk about what Marc Andreessen was like at the dawn of his career. Lauren, I would like to ask you to chart the early Marc Andreessen years for us.\nLauren Goode: Well, first I'm going to start off by saying that I've listened to a lot of podcasts now with Marc Andreessen, and a signature of listening to Marc Andreessen podcasts is that you're constantly checking to see if you accidentally hit the 2X button because he talks—\nZoë Schiffer: So real.\nLauren Goode: … so fast. He says a lot, and he says it quickly. OK. Just for some context, Marc Andreessen was born in 1971. He grew up in Wisconsin. He went to the University of Illinois to study electrical engineering. He ended up switching to computer science, which was really more of his jam. He has said that basically, his timing in life has a lot to do with his success. He said in early interviews there were a couple of federally funded programs happening around the time that he went to college that really supported what became the consumer internet. One of those was the National Science Foundation's NSFNET, and his university, University of Illinois, was receiving funding through that. So he really was sort of in the right place at the right time.\nZoë Schiffer: Seems like a uniquely humble stance for a Silicon Valley billionaire to admit.\nLauren Goode: Easy to say when you're just swimming through your billions every day. You look like that guy from Breaking Bad, just sleeping on the pile of money, and then you're like, yes, I owe my success to the NSFNET grant.\nZoë Schiffer: That's big, magnanimous.\nLauren Goode: So it's while he's at the University of Illinois that he and some other people develop Mosaic. Mosaic was a web browser, and we all know what a web browser is now, but at the time, Mosaic was doing something really different. It was different from the super nerdy text-based internet systems like BBS or bulletin board systems, and it was different from the closed portals or stove-pipes, as Andreessen himself has called them, like AOL, or Prodigy, or CompuServe. Mosaic was a graphical user-friendly portal to the open web, and this really was a huge innovation at the time. This actually ends up playing into Andreessen's ideas around Little Tech, which I think we're going to talk about, because at the time, he really was the Little Tech. He has said that if Apple or Microsoft had developed the browser first, we would probably be even more entrenched in what we think of as Big Tech today, because they were Big Tech at the time and what he was trying to do was Little Tech.\nZoë Schiffer: Mike, do you remember using Mosaic?\nMichael Calore: I do. It came out while I was in college. Marc Andreessen is a few years older than me, so around the time he was leaving college, I was entering college. I remember being in school and within a matter of months, everybody went from checking their email in Pine, a text-based interface, and that's all they were using the computer for, to all of a sudden hanging out for hours, and reading news, and checking the weather, and visiting the libraries of other universities around the world who were putting their hypertext pages into this interface that you could just click and you were just using your mouse all the time to click around instead of typing commands into a keyboard. There was also graphics in Mosaic, so you could go to a page and click on something, see an image. It sounds really rote and basic now, but this was the birth of the web, and it was kind of astonishing how quickly it just flowed in, and I think it's because Mosaic was free. It was easy to get. Everybody’s sort of, “Oh, do you have the browser? You go here, you download it, you install it.” Everybody was helping each other to get onto this new system.\nZoë Schiffer: Feels like a nice era of the internet and also the beginning of the end for us. People used to just live their actual lives, and then we all started spending a shit-ton of time online and look where we are now.\nMichael Calore: They did, and I think it's hard to overstate the importance of a piece of software like the first few web browsers, because it was really an empowering technology. So, for me, in the early part of the web, Marc Andreessen was this amazing figure who brought us this wonderful gift. So, after the success of Mosaic, where did he go from there? What did he go on to do?\nLauren Goode: Well, Mosaic was built within the University of Illinois, and he really wanted to commercialize the browser. So, he ended up moving away from the Mosaic project to cofound Netscape and then called that browser the Netscape Navigator because the university owned the rights to the Mosaic name, and he ends up selling Netscape. It gets acquired by AOL. He and Jim Clark sell it for 10 billion dollars. I think the time the deal was announced in 1998, it was a $4.2 billion deal, and by the time it went through a year later, it somehow became $10 billion. So, I guess, never just take the first offer, folks. I don't know what you're supposed to take away from that, just billions of dollars in difference. So, they become very rich. I think Jim Clark was more rich, but Andreessen certainly made his millions too, and then a few years later, this is a big moment. He becomes an early investor in Facebook and he joins the board. There's one point in Facebook's history where Facebook is considering getting acquired, and Andreessen talks Zuckerberg away from this. He tells him to keep growing the company. This is quite literally where Andreessen makes billions of dollars.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, that seems like a good decision for Mark Zuckerberg.\nLauren Goode: Right, and Marc Andreessen. Good decision for all the Marks.\nMichael Calore: So, the Facebook investment is around the time that he starts getting serious about becoming a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley. So what happens next?\nLauren Goode: So, in 2009, he and Ben Horowitz start a venture capital firm and they call it Andreessen Horowitz. A lot of people refer to this as a16z. That's what the firm calls itself, because it's the letter a, 16 letters, and the letter z. a16z is interesting because it is absolutely one of the premier firms of Silicon Valley. It sets a lot of the culture of the Valley. It has tens of billions of dollars invested across all kinds of companies, but it also really set new standards for how VCs interact with startup founders. I was talking with a friend recently about … We were talking broadly about workplaces where people feel supported and workplaces where there tend to be these misaligned structures, and we ended up talking about a16z and the fact that early on what they did in the Valley was create this kind of support system for founders. The partners at the firm there get really involved with some of their investments, for better or worse, because sometimes founders don't want all that meddling, but that really kind of compelled other VC firms to start thinking about these wrappers of support that they can provide when they're also giving money to a startup. Guys, this firm has everything. They have invested in every possible company you can think of, not just Facebook and Twitter, but Airbnb, Slack, Instacart, Oculus, Databricks, Lyft, Roblox, Pinterest, GitHub, OpenAI. It is crazy. They also, as Zoë mentioned earlier, have funds dedicated to crypto investments. They're very big on crypto.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, the BeamPro founder feels like a real hallmark of Andreessen Horowitz because I feel like, previously, or maybe it's just other VC firms, they'll invest in a founder that they really believe in, but then they'll bring in a professional CEO at a certain point. I feel like Andreessen Horowitz is very big on the founder is the person with the vision, and we should support them and help them grow.\nLauren Goode: Right. They might recommend a COO or a CFO that's going to take them public at some point, but yes, they really do invest in and believe in their founders. I think in some ways they all want them to feel like they're the micro celebrity of their company world, and Andreessen's own celebrity has only grown through this firm. He has a really, really strong personality. He says a lot. Like I said earlier, he talks really fast. Let me just say what Zoe said earlier too. He allegedly gives off feral vibes on the internet.\nZoë Schiffer: Exactly. It's my personal view.\nLauren Goode: He talks in podcasts about how he learned some things about management and how to handle sticky situations as he got older, but he also has gotten edgier. He tweets a lot.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: We should talk about Twitter.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. He's PMARCA on Twitter and everywhere else, and he loves Twitter because he loves stirring the pot, so to speak.\nLauren Goode: Is he actually still tweeting today? Because I haven't gone on Twitter in so long.\nZoë Schiffer: We can't know because one of the core parts of his Twitter usage is that he blocks journalists with abandon.\nLauren Goode: He's tweeting sporadically now it appears. All I can see is November 7th, 2024, November 12th, December 20th, and then another one on January 19th. So, wait, we have an update. Our producer just jumped in to say that she can see a lot more tweets, so we're not going to say her name because then Marc Andreessen is going to go block her, but apparently, I am still blocked and I can't see all the tweets. So, to me, it looks like he's tweeting sporadically, but he is still a very prolific tweeter, this guy, and for some reason that we have never quite fully understood, he started blocking journalists. Do you guys know why he blocked you?\nMichael Calore: I think just in general, Marc Andreessen is hostile towards the media. He doesn't really like to sit for interviews with people that he doesn't consider already ideologically aligned with him. From the outside looking in, that's what it looks like.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I agree with that. He really does seem to have this view that a lot of Silicon Valley now has, that the idea that you would invest all of this time and money in a startup and then one New York Times article could tank it is completely uncomfortable and unacceptable. For me personally, my old beat was labor in Silicon Valley, so I think that that was probably a no-go for me and Marc's relationship.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I'm not quite sure of the moment when I was blocked. Obviously, he's entitled to do what he wants, but it is funny to think of him as this … He is a godfather figure in Silicon Valley to a lot of people, and we write about these companies and the culture of Silicon Valley where you have people like his pal, Mark Zuckerberg, who kind of ironically now leans so heavily on the idea of free speech and opening up communication. Meanwhile, Andreessen is someone whose tweets we as journalists can't even really access directly. We see them posted elsewhere, and we sort of have a sense of where he's coming from, but that direct access to journalists is cut off in some cases.\nMichael Calore: Andreessen Horowitz famously likes to go direct, as they say. He's tweeting constantly. He is making his ideas known. He also blogs a lot. His firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has its own blog platform. The founders and other partners often seed op-eds at other publications. There are three key memos that Marc Andreessen has made. I want to call them blog posts, but really they're memos that I think we should talk about.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. On a side note, I think it's really funny that they're very anti the mainstream media, but then when they want to write on op-ed, the mainstream media is not the enemy anymore.\nLauren Goode: Well, I think the most famous one was in The Wall Street Journal, and that's the one that people cite all the time now. Software is eating the world. Mike, tell us about this one.\nMichael Calore: Yes. So, in 2011, Marc Andreessen published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. It is called “Why Software Is Eating the World,” and if you don't have a Wall Street Journal subscription, you can just read this on the Andreessen Horowitz website, because it's also published there. It was written in 2011 at a time that is really an interesting time for Silicon Valley, because it's a few years after the financial crisis. It's also a few years after the launch of the iPhone, but it is before many of the big technological revolutions that we know happened in the 2010s. What he posits is that technology has reached the point where you can run a big company completely online, and all of the next big companies are going to maintain their dominant positions in the marketplace through software. So, the world is moving from the physical world of business into software as a service, and he says this is going to create a fundamental shift in the world economy, because all of these big companies are going to be doing their business online. They're all going to be using cloud computing, and it's going to just change the structure of how business works in the world. It's kind of fascinating to read it now, 14, 15 years later, because he was right. If you look at what happened after that memo came out, Netflix basically ate Blockbuster, and then it completely changed the way that we consume content through our televisions. Airbnb ate the hotel industry. Uber ate the taxi service and car service industry, and you can just look at a lot of examples where software did actually take over a complete sector of the business.\nLauren Goode: Mike, when you were going back and reading this and acknowledging that he was right, did it change the way you thought about Marc Andreessen from a decade ago? Because we're obviously coming into this today talking about this very particular political moment, but going back to Netscape and Mosaic and early Facebook investment, and software is eating the world, he is right about a lot of things.\nMichael Calore: Yes, absolutely. I would say there are a lot of things that he says on podcasts and in his memos and on social media that I just do not agree with. He has this view of who CEOs are as people, that they're really just trying to be better people and that they're not really as concerned about profit as everybody seems to think they are. The idea that if you have any disagreements with how venture capital works and how capitalism works, that you are a Marxist and you are a far-left individual. There are all these things that I'm just like, no, that's not the way the world works, man. He sees things as very black-and-white, and he sees things from his point of view, and I don't share those views, and I certainly don't look at the world the same way that he does. However, he's very smart. He completely understands how technology works in business, and he was right about a great many things. So Marc Andreessen tends to come along at these times of crisis in the country and in the world and put out these missives about how we should move forward. Lauren, I want to tee you up for this next part because I know that you want to talk about “It's time to build.”\nLauren Goode: “It's time to build.” Yeah, so this was the early pandemic era, and the whole world is in this position of being caught flat-footed by it. In the US, you all remember, we're in this place of scarcity. Where's the toilet paper, but also more critically, where are extra hospital beds and ventilators, and where are the vaccines, and also the stimulus checks and bailouts to help American enterprise and the American people? Andreessen uses these examples as framing for why America just has to build more in general, like schools and housing. He critiques the ideologies of both the left and right in this manifesto, but ultimately, he's a staunch capitalist. He says if the left can prove that the public sector can build things faster, sure, have at it, but he really believes that more solutions are going to come from the private sector. This does resonate with some people, and not a year later, a lot of the stuff he was crowing about in this April 2020 essay is no longer as much of a critical problem. America did in fact race to find solutions, particularly around the vaccines, but really these solutions were only short-term, but it is also clear from this manifesto that he still has this kind of romantic notion of capitalism, this idea that capitalism is how we take care of the people we don't know. I could see how you believe that to be true when you are this innovator directly responsible for creating jobs for millions of people you'll never actually meet, but I think we also have to acknowledge some of the societal imbalances that come from pure capitalism. But once again, this essay lands at a moment. He's really good at hitting that moment with these manifestos.\nZoë Schiffer: You know, that one sounds a lot like the Techno-Optimist Manifesto, which I really hope that I never have to talk about publicly again, but this was his most recent blog post where he talks about the idea that growth is progress, and technology is a primary driver of economic and social advancement and basically pits people who are negative about technology and growth and capitalism against people who are positive about it. Techno-optimists like Marc Andreessen believe in free markets, and he says in this blog that they, meaning techno-optimists, have a lot of enemies. He says, “Our enemies are not bad people. They are bad ideas.” The ideas that he views negatively in this are things like ESG, so environmental, social, and governance, social responsibility, tech ethics, trust, and safety. So, content moderation is kind of said quietly here, and he ends the manifesto by saying, “It's time to be a techno-optimist, and it's time to build.”\nLauren Goode: Oh, so he says, “It's time to build” in this one too?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Well, it's almost like he needs an editor just to point out there's some redundancies there.\nZoë Schiffer: No, no, no.\nMichael Calore: There's an echo. Lauren, to your point, here's a memo, a manifesto that is filled with a lot of interesting and good ideas, but that just feels misguided because the things that he's telling us to stay away from are the things that I think are a net positive for society, and he feels are a net negative for society. I think a lot of people sort of felt that way when they read this. They were like, what is this guy talking about? It felt kind of unhinged because you're talking about tearing down these things that we've set up to protect people.\nZoë Schiffer: It doesn't seem to me like he's gotten less smart. He's obviously a very smart dude, but in my reading, it definitely feels like he's become a little less tethered to the reality that regular people live in because he's not going to be impacted by Meta rolling back its commitment to trust and safety and content moderation the way other people are.\nMichael Calore: OK. I think we have a pretty clear picture of his worldview, and for anybody who wants to read more, you can follow the show notes to read all of those manifestos. Clear off a couple of days on your calendar, because you will need it. Let's take another break and we'll come back with more Uncanny Valley.\n[break]\nMichael Calore: So, before we end, we have to look forward. Marc Andreessen has his thumb on the scale in Washington. What is his relationship like with the Trump administration, and how is that going to change our future?\nZoë Schiffer: I think we're still kind of seeing how it's going to shape up. As we said at the beginning of the show, he's a close adviser to now President Trump, and he's really working to reshape the US government to be optimistic about tech, to be a techno-optimist, if you will. He's focused on deregulation, specifically with crypto and AI, and efficiency, which is a huge tenet of DOGE, Elon Musk's government project. I think on a more subtle level, although I don't know if you could call it subtle, he's resetting the culture so that being a rich capitalist is once again seen as a good thing, not a bad thing, except I don't see them giving away their money this time around. What about you guys?\nLauren Goode: It is my personal opinion that Marc Andreessen is very allegedly going to have huge influence over this administration's policies. Hot take.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. Based on his un-permanent residence at Mar-a-Lago.\nMichael Calore: Lauren, I agree with you because, as we've talked about and as history has shown, his ideas definitely do shape the way that technology and business and government all work together, and I don't see that changing, especially now that he has such a large platform.\nLauren Goode: I just think for guys like Marc Andreessen, there's probably no amount of power or land or money that's ever really enough. It's hard to say exactly what the outcome of his influence on the current administration is going to be. We're probably going to see a lot of pro-tech policies and regulations, or lack thereof I should say, that really support the tech industry. It feels like what a lot of these rich and powerful guys are very good at and have gotten very rich from is world building, and the world that they're building right now is probably great for them, but like Zoë said earlier, not really applicable to the rest of us.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Our country has just rolled back a bunch of green energy initiatives and gone hard into fossil fuels again in order to create boom times for the energy industry. That's also going to be boom times for crypto and for AI, which require a lot of computing resources. So, you can see the influence that these tech leaders, not just Marc Andreessen, but all of them who are crowding around the White House right now are having on policy, and you can see them sort of shaping the world that is going to be very beneficial towards them and their investments, to state the obvious.\nLauren Goode: Well, I don't know, Mike. How much do you have in crypto right now? Because I got to tell you, I'm going to open my Robinhood app and look at the … Did you know that you guys can also trade the Trump coin now on Robinhood?\nMichael Calore: Oh, gosh. OK. So, here's the real question that we need to answer. Is he ever going to unblock us?\nZoë Schiffer: No.\nLauren Goode: No. Don't hold your breath.\nZoë Schiffer: It depends on how many positive profiles you write about his founders I think.\nMichael Calore: Probably. I can say that I'll never know, because I'm not on X anymore, and I know that's where he primarily hangs out because that's his crowd. I hang out on the platform that he loves to make fun of, which is Bluesky. He says it's the place where all the libs go. It's the blue zone.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, we're happily in our respective echo chambers now.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: We won't have to interact.\nMichael Calore: And may it forever be thus.

Were there specific issues that they weren't seeing eye to eye on?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> Yeah, for sure, but one thing that has really stuck out to me when we've been listening to Marc Andreessen talk about these meetings and the issues that they were fighting over is, I guess it's obvious that billionaires meet with high-ranking government officials, but every time I hear it, I'm like, oh, wow, I guess that is how the world works. They're just sitting down talking about their grievances. They get the direct line to the White House.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> They're talking about memecoins, basically.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> Yeah, that's what they do. Literally though, Lauren, that seems to be what's happening. So yeah, the three areas that the Biden administration and the Marc Andreessens of the world seemingly really do not see eye to eye on are content moderation, crypto, and AI. So, with content moderation, Mark Zuckerberg has talked about this a lot recently, but there's this sense that the Biden administration is calling tech companies, putting pressure on them, this is actually called job owning, to take down posts or suppress certain narratives. Marc Andreessen, he's implied that he's quite uncomfortable with this. Then with the crypto industry in particular, Marc says that the Biden administration starts a terror campaign against crypto, and this is obviously personal, because his venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has 7.6 billion in crypto assets, and Biden's doing things like issuing executive orders, directing federal agencies to assess the risks of crypto. He appoints SEC chair Gary Gensler, who ramps up crypto enforcement actions pretty significantly, and then the real breaking point is with AI, so leading into the 2024 election between Biden and Trump, Marc Andreessen again has these closed-door meetings, he says, with the Biden administration, and they say that they're going to get very involved in AI. They're basically, according to Marc, not going to allow AI startups to flourish, they're going to have just a few big tech companies that are doing AI, and the government will basically control them. Sam Altman has come out publicly and said this is not his view of those meetings, which he apparently maybe attended, but Marc is like, we cannot allow this to happen. We have to come out in full force for Donald Trump, and that is what he does.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "A conspiracy-theory-laden conference featuring anti-vaccine speakers, including one man known for pushing toxic bleach as a cure for cancer and autism, will take place in May at the Trump National Doral Miami resort in Florida.\nThe “truth seekers” conference, held at a hotel owned and frequented by President Donald Trump, is being organized by Charlie Ward, an antisemitic conspiracy-theory peddler who lives in Spain and has a huge following online where he discusses QAnon, 9/11, the purported flatness of the earth, lizard people, and more.\nIt will be a who’s who of US anti-vaxxers and Covid deniers. The event will feature dozens of speakers, including many who led the effort to undermine the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, as well as QAnon promoters, election deniers like disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn (though his name was subsequently removed from the website promoting the event), and anti-immigrant campaigners like Christie Hutcherson, who leads Women Fighting for America.\nThe conference’s website also listed Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, as a headline speaker, though the event organizer told WIRED that her presence is still not fully confirmed. Hours after WIRED contacted the organizers, her name was removed.\nAndreas Kalcker, a German man who has promoted a bleach-like solution as a cure for autism and cancer, will also be in attendance. In an interview this month on Rumble, Kalcker said he would be presenting data and testimonials from users of his solution at the conference.\nKalcker is largely viewed as the inventor of chlorine dioxide solution, also known as Water Purification Solution, Chlorine Dioxide Protocol, or MMS in other similar circles. (The letters stand for Miracle Mineral Supplement, Miracle Mineral Solution, and other similar variants.) Whatever name it goes by, it is a toxic liquid that has been peddled in alternative health circles for years as a “cure” for everything from autism to cancer, HIV/AIDS, and Covid-19. In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration warned that “ingesting these products is the same as drinking bleach.” Among the possible side effects listed are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and acute liver failure.\nKalcker has focused much of his efforts on selling the solution in Latin America, and his promotion of the toxic solution is credited with helping persuade the Bolivian government to approve it as a cure for Covid.\nIn 2021, Kalcker was charged by authorities in Argentina “with illegal practice of the medical profession and selling fake medicines,” Business Insider reported, following the death of a 5-year-old boy whose parents gave him Kalcker’s solution with the belief that it would ward off Covid.\nIt’s his presence at the conference that’s most concerning to activists who have spent years trying to highlight the dangers posed by selling the toxic bleach-like solution.\nAs the Trump administration pushes to confirm anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy to head up the Department of Health and Human Services, activists are deeply concerned that dangerous alternative health solutions, such as chlorine dioxide, could become mainstream by being associated with members of the Trump family.\nFiona O’Leary, an Ireland-based activist who has autistic children and has spent years trying to highlight the dangers of toxic bleach solution being sold as an autism cure, worries that the Miami conference will “platform” Kalcker and allow him to increase his influence in the US.\n“Andreas Kalcker has been giving bleach to autistic children for many years,” O’Leary, who has tracked Kalcker’s activities closely, tells WIRED. “Kalcker is not a doctor. His protocol for autism involves poisoning autistic children with chlorine dioxide, bleach. Autistic children are forced to drink this poison all day long and forced to suffer burning bleach enemas. It is child abuse.”\nKalcker did not respond to a request for comment.\nTickets for the two-day conference, which is taking place following a charity golf event also organized by Ward, range from $50 tickets for basic access to $2,300 VIP guests that include accommodation at the hotel and access to the speakers.\nWard, who claims to have been to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on a number of occasions, rose to prominence online in 2020 for spreading Covid-19 and QAnon conspiracy theories on YouTube before his account was banned. Now, Ward primarily livestreams on the alternative video platform Rumble, where he is a verified user and has over 200,000 subscribers. He is very well connected in Trump world: His previous guests on the show have included Flynn, former Trump adviser Roger Stone, and Trump’s current nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel.\nStuart Leary, the conference’s director, told WIRED that the majority of attendees are from the US, but up to one third of guests will travel from abroad to attend. Between 900 and 1,000 people will be attending the conference, Leary says.\nWhen asked if Eric Trump would be speaking alongside his wife, Lara Trump, Leary told WIRED he didn’t know. However in a conversation with O’Leary, the activist, a recording of which was shared with WIRED, Leary says he has “heard unofficially that two [members of the Trump family] will be there,” adding that they would not be making that public due to security concerns.\nLeigh Dundas, a California attorney who became a prominent pusher of Covid-19 conspiracies before attending the January 6 attack on the Capitol, will be in attendance, as will Sherri Tenpenny, an anti-vaxxer who shot to fame when she claimed the Covid vaccine makes you magnetic. Tenpenny also claims vaccines cause autism.\nScott McKay, known as the Patriot Streetfighter, is also slated to speak. He streams on Rumble and, in addition to promoting QAnon conspiracy theories, has inserted himself into local school board debates about mask mandates. McKay has pushed wildly antisemitic conspiracy theories in the past, including claims that Jewish people orchestrated the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks as well as the assassinations of presidents Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, and William McKinley. He routinely pushes the centuries-old claim that Jewish people torture children and drink their blood.\nIn 2023, McKay was banned from speaking at another conspiracy-filled conference at Trump’s Doral resort after media reports revealed his antisemitic comments. That event was one of dozens of stops on the ReAwaken America tour, a traveling conspiracy circus organized by Flynn and filled with Christian nationalists, election deniers, conspiracy theorists, and numerous members of Trump’s own family.\nWard was also banned from that event, due to his history of spewing antisemitic and Hitler-praising social media content. Media watchdog Media Matters outlined multiple occasions where Ward’s official Telegram channel, which was subsequently deleted, posted deeply antisemitic content, including a post that said “Hitler was warning us” about Jewish people.\nWhen WIRED asked Ward about these posts, he denied making them, claiming initially that the channel referenced in the Media Matters article was a fake channel.\nWhen it was pointed out to Ward that an archived copy of his own website linked to that channel directly, and it had been promoted on his livestreams, Ward claimed that the account may have been hacked. He also claimed he had never posted anything on Telegram and that he had a team of people who did that for him.\nWard did, however, admit to saying that more people were killed by the Covid vaccine than in the Holocaust. “How many people in here know that more people have been killed by the jab than were killed in the Holocaust? And they're still doing it because nobody can stop them,” Ward said at a ReAwaken America tour stop.\nWard told WIRED that 15 million people were killed by the Covid-19 vaccine, “and that’s a fact.” This is not true. When asked for evidence to back up his claim, Ward could not provide it.\nIt appears, however, that Ward’s antisemitic comments have not damaged his relationship with the Trump organization. “Interestingly, it was Trump Doral who approached us to come for our event this year,” claims Ward. “So maybe they realize the truth.”\nThe Trump Organization did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the event.",

    "content_text": "Investigators are scrambling to figure out why a military helicopter and a passenger airplane collided and plunged into the Potomac River in Washington, DC, late Wednesday, the first major US air crash in 16 years.\nFrom the little that’s known, human error likely played a role, raising questions about a chronic shortage of air traffic controllers and pilots. During a press conference Thursday morning, President Donald Trump at times appeared to blame diversity programs within the Federal Aviation Administration and the helicopter’s pilots for the crash, though he admitted there were no known links between FAA hiring policies and the crash beyond “common sense.” Authorities may also be looking at coordination between military and civilian aviation.\nUS officials say an Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers plowed into the tail of a Bombardier CRJ-700 jet out of Wichita, Kansas, as the airliner was less than a mile from landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport. Video of the incident appeared to show the flaming remains of both aircraft tumble a few hundred feet into the shallow, icy river.\nThe passenger jet, which was operated by regional carrier PSA Airlines on behalf of American Airlines, had 64 people on board, and police boats have already recovered 27 bodies. Officials said Thursday morning they expect there to be no survivors. The last aircraft tragedy this deadly in the United States was the Colgan Air crash in New York state in 2009.\nIn a video released on Thursday morning, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that the helicopter was associated with the Army’s 12th Aviation Battalion, which is based less than 20 miles from DC’s national airport. The secretary said the “fairly experienced” crew was conducting a required annual night evaluation and were equipped with night-vision goggles. The identity of those on board is known, and their next of kin are being informed.\nIn a grainy video from the nearby Kennedy Center, a smaller light, presumably the helicopter, can be seen overtaking the brighter light of the plane, both of them flying low to the ground. The two collide in a massive explosion, splitting into several burning fragments.\nA few minutes before the American Airlines flight’s arrival, air traffic control asked if it could land on runway 33, a shorter runway. The pilots said yes, apparently switching runways during their approach. Some have wondered whether this change in flight path could have caught the Black Hawk off guard.\nBut retired Air Force Brigadier General John Teichert told NewsNation television that this shouldn’t have caused a crash. “I think that while they would have been told to switch runways, it’s not this aggressive maneuver in a regional jet that would prompt them to reposition and be a surprise to the Black Hawk,” he said.\nEighty percent of aviation accidents worldwide can be attributed to human error, and that is a prime candidate in this case, Marco Chan, a former pilot who now heads pilot programs at Buckinghamshire New University, told WIRED. “Perhaps safety protocols, human factors were at play,” he says. In recent years, the FAA has struggled to replace retiring air traffic controllers, even as the number of air passengers and flights rebounded after the pandemic. The FAA said last fall that it had exceeded its internal air traffic controller hiring goals for the year.\nShortly before the crash on Wednesday night, air traffic control asked the helicopter if it had seen the aircraft and told it to “pass behind the CRJ,” which would have had the right of way unless the Black Hawk was on an urgent military mission. It’s not known if the helicopter responded.\nMilitary flights sometimes operate on different radio frequencies than passenger flights, so the passenger jet’s crew may not have heard the tower radioing the Black Hawk. Or there may have been a jammed transmission: If more than one party on a channel are radioing at the same time, that can prevent others from hearing the whole conversation.\nThe airline pilots probably didn’t see the helicopter, and even if they had, it would likely have been too late, Chan says. “They would be very focused on the final approach on the actual landing on the runway. It would be very difficult to do anything at the end,” he says. “[The Black Hawk] would have been under the wing and flying toward the tail, and the pilots in the cockpit, they are at the front. It would have been very difficult for them to spot the helicopter.”\nUntil the black box recorders are retrieved from the passenger plane, it’s impossible to know for sure what the passenger pilots didn’t know or didn’t see as they came in for landing.\nSeveral hours after the accident President Trump posted on Truth Social, stating that air traffic control should have told the helicopter how to maneuver to avoid the jet. “This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented,” the president said. Trump posted again on the platform on Thursday morning, thanking emergency responders and saying he had been fully briefed and that he was monitoring the situation.\nDuring a press conference later on Thursday, the president then appeared to blame FAA diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives for the crash, though he said he didn’t have any evidence demonstrating clear links. He also seemed to ascribe the tragedy to former US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. New Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the crash “preventable.”\nAllegations of overwork and fatigue have been plaguing air travel. The number of people flying has recovered since Covid and even exceeded pre-pandemic numbers. Hiring hasn’t been able to keep up.\nAir traffic controllers are particularly understaffed. Twenty-six critical air traffic facilities are staffed below the FAA’s 85-percent threshold, according to the US Department of Transportation.\nIn July, the FAA agreed to increase mandatory rest time to 10 to 12 hours between shifts for air traffic controllers after a handful of near accidents.\nLast year, a controller cleared a FedEx plane to land on a runway in Austin, Texas, while a Southwest Airlines flight was taking off from it. Fatigue was not explicitly cited as a factor in the investigation, but controllers have complained of being overworked. “If you can’t plug the hole, if it’s only at 85 percent, someone will have to work harder,” Chan says.\nSome in the aviation industry hope that computers can take up some of the slack. A Korean company has developed a robot that can pilot planes, including military jets. There is also research into using AI to help control air traffic or pilot planes. AI could monitor fatigue among pilots or controllers, Chan says, but we’re unlikely to see a pilotless commercial plane any time soon.\n“Actual humans as pilots overseeing the operation of the computer is a safer bet at this moment,” he says.\nAdditional reporting by Aarian Marshall.

Learn more.\nTake it from someone who records music: The world of high-end audio is often tainted with bullshit. Precious (and often snake-oily) materials and terms are exploited to sell products for inflated prices. Faux science is deployed to trick you into thinking you need overpriced accessories like 2-inch-thick speaker cables.\nOnce you start shopping for gear that approaches four figures, it's tough to distinguish what's good-sounding from what's simply good-looking. Never fear! Our experts have spent thousands of hours listening to music in acoustically treated home studios through many of the most-loved high-end headphones, speakers, and amps on the market. Below you'll find our favorites and some information about what each item does.\nBefore reading on, be sure to check out our cheap (or free!) tips on how to get more out of your home audio setup.\nInterested in other audio advice? Check out the tips in our other guides, including the Best Wireless Headphones, Best Bookshelf Speakers, Best Turntables, Best Bluetooth Speakers, and Best Gear for Learning Music.\nUpdated January 2025: We've updated some other gear options and added the Outlaw Audio RR2160 Mk II.\nConsider where you will be listening before you decide what you should be listening with.\nThe quality of the sound you hear in your room will only ever be as good as the room itself. A pair of $250 speakers will sound better in a room that's been acoustically treated than a pair of $10,000 speakers will sound in an empty room with bare floors and walls.\nWhat exactly is \"bad\" when it comes to room dynamics for high-end listening? Typically it means sound waves bounce around too much, creating frequency issues like muddy bass and giving the room what's known as a long reverb decay time. This is the length of time it takes for sound to die out as it bounces off the walls.\nTry this: Clap your hands loudly in the middle of your room and listen for the decay—the audible echoing of that clapping sound. The best way to shorten that decay time is to fill the room with as much soft, porous mass as possible. This helps control audio reflections, damping them so you hear more of the focused sound waves coming out of the speakers, and fewer of the messy sound waves bouncing around the room. To treat a room, use acoustic panels (typically Rockwool insulation wrapped in cheap fabric and hung from the walls or ceiling) to provide the recommended amount of coverage for the space.\nThrobbing and thumping bass frequencies, which are harder to tame than higher frequencies like splashy cymbals and twangy guitars, will typically degrade the audio quality in smaller rooms. Significant porous absorption is required to make large speakers sound great in a tighter space like a bedroom. If you like big speakers with big bass, set up your system somewhere more spacious.\nIn general, the softer and bigger your room is the bigger you can go in terms of speaker systems, and the better they'll sound. If you're stuck setting up your stereo in a room that's either small or particularly reverberant and acoustically “bright,” I recommend buying smaller speakers or just sticking with headphones. (Don't worry, great headphones are awesome.)\nWhen improving your listening room, it's worth noting that investing in some acoustic treatment is much more cost-effective than investing in more expensive audio gear. You can buy or build enough panels for a medium-size space with just a few hundred dollars, and they can actually make your room look pretty neat. In my experience, hanging some panels and curtains over your bare walls will increase the quality of your sound more than any single piece of equipment.\nBecause they take problems with room acoustics out of the equation, a quality pair of headphones is the place most budding audiophiles should start.\nOpen-backed headphones like the Sennheiser/Drop HD6XX ($239) are a great first buy for those with a quiet listening room. “Open-back” means they don't seal out the outside world like the “closed-back” over-ears you might be used to. There's little to block sound in or out—not only will other people hear your music, but you'll be able to hear sounds other than your music. However, open-back headphones sound more natural and speaker-like. They are the perfect headphones to plug straight into a phone or a stereo, though you will notice that using a dedicated headphone amp improves the sound. (More on those later.)\nIf you want more sound isolation, I also really like in-ear headphones like the Shure Aonic 3 ($199), which cut out very nearly all outside noise, and pack up super small for travel. Sound quality is excellent, especially with an outboard headphone amp in tow.\nAt the higher end, my current favorite in-ears are from Portland-based brand Campfire Audio (the 3D-printed Supermoon ($1,099). I also love custom-molded in-ears from Ultimate Ears Pro like the brilliantly transparent UE Reference Remastered and the beefier UE 18+ Pro, both of which are among the most comfortable and accurate earbuds you'll find. There are many other high-end in-ears to choose from, with new models and technologies like xMEMS' solid-state drivers poised to increasingly shake up the market.\nIf you prefer over-ear headphones, our entire audio team really likes the French brand Focal. The Celestee closed-back headphones ($999) are as gorgeous to listen to as they are to look at, and the Bathys ($699) are wireless and offer noise-canceling, making them some of the best for travel. They produce one of the widest soundstages you'll find in wireless headphones. (In headphone lingo, the soundstage is the imaginary three-dimensional space you find yourself in when you shut your eyes and listen.) Other great wireless options that compete with wired headphones are the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 ($699) and the Master & Dynamic MW75 ($599), both of which feature beautiful design and high-end materials.\nI still have yet to encounter a pair of wireless earbuds that sound amazing, but the best I've tested are the Astell & Kern UW100 ($299), which have some of the most realistic sound you'll find, thanks to the company's excellent processing.\nFans of open-back listening with big budgets should check out the Elex ($599), a collaboration between Drop and Focal that brings elements of Focal's more expensive Elear and Clear headphones to the sub-$1,000 mark. They sound better than many pricier closed-back models. Another solid pair are the Neumann NDH 30 ($649), which are aimed at more studio-style sound. If you've got unlimited cash, the Audeze LCD-5 ($4,500) are exceptional. They offer the cleanest, clearest sound I've ever heard from a pair of headphones—great for high rollers without perfect listening rooms.\nA quality pair of wired speakers will last a lifetime with a little TLC, while powered/active speakers may have less longevity, but should still last many years. Speaker size and power output is an important factor when determining what to buy. For most people, smaller, “bookshelf-style\" speakers are the best fit. If you have a big listening space, though, consider going bigger. It's not always true, but larger speakers typically have better bass response and a wider, more expansive soundstage.\nYour first speaker purchase should be a quality pair for your desktop. After all, it's where you probably spend a lot of your time at home. For listening at my desk, I love the iLoud Micro Monitors ($350). They're a small pair that sound exceptional for their size and have surprisingly awesome bass response.\nIf you're looking for the best bookshelf speakers, my favorite pair is the KEF LS50 Wireless II ($2,500 per pair). They have the biggest, most detailed sound I've ever heard from a pair of speakers their size. The cheaper KEF LSX II ($1,300-1,400 per pair) are also great, as are the wired KEF LS50 Meta ($1,600 per pair). We've also recently tried and enjoyed the Q Acoustics M20 HD ($499 per pair), which are a solid option for those who want a small but great-sounding pair for a turntable or desktop with Bluetooth streaming.\nThe models I just mentioned are powered. They have amplification and connections built in, and they draw their power from a wall socket, so they can be used without a dedicated amplifier. If you already have an amp (or if you plan to buy one), a pair of passive speakers is the best way to go. Those hook up with regular speaker cables, and you won't need to worry about plugging them into the wall.\nSome passive bookshelf models I love are the ELAC Debut 2.0 ($380 per pair) and JBL 4309 ($1,100-2,000 per pair), though the latter is getting harder to find. The ELACs are a great entry-level speaker that will easily take you into audiophile territory with the right amp, whereas the 4309 more or less sound amazing with anything powering them. I'm a fan of fun, energetic sound when I'm listening on speakers, and both of these models deliver that, but with enough detail that you won't feel you're sacrificing anything.\nMore recently, we've tested some excellent options at relatively accessible pricing, like Focal's smooth and detailed Theva No 1 ($1,000 per pair) and the more taut and punchy SVS Ultra Evolution ($1,200 per pair), both of which are among our favorite reference speakers right now. If you like a brighter sound that really brings the bass, the Bowers & Wilkins 606 S3 ($1,100) are also worth considering.\nMoving away from bookshelves and onto passive floorstanding speakers, I'll highlight two very different models. The Paradigm Monitor SE 6000F ($1,000 per pair) are a great pair of speakers for those who like things a bit more clinical and precise—they're amazing for classical music, jazz, and folk, thanks to their incredible detail. Some audiophiles prefer the type of tight precision you get from speakers like the Paradigms. The more lively Klipsch Forte IV ($4,998 per pair) are perfectly tuned, mid-century–inspired masterpieces with hand-made wooden cabinets and gorgeous horn tweeters. Their 15-inch passive bass radiators at the back help them punch deeper and with more authority than a professional boxer. If you're looking for the most fun you've ever had listening to Hendrix at high volume, these are the way to go.\nYour taste may differ from mine! The best way to find your favorite high-end speakers is to use your ears. Find a local dealer and go listen to several models before you buy. For reference, other brands that make excellent speakers these days include Yamaha, Bang & Olufsen, and Polk Audio, among many other boutique brands.\nYou'll never know how a pair of speakers truly sounds in your room until you get them there, so try to test them at home. Most high-end dealers allow a trial option, but big-box retailers may not so check the return policy on anything you buy.\nDigital-to-analog converters (DACs) take the digital audio signal from your audio files and convert them to analog audio that you can send (via an amplifier) to headphones and speakers. Every piece of digital technology you own that comes with a headphone jack already has a DAC chip inside it, but it's usually a pretty cheap one. If you route your signal through a dedicated DAC—one with better components and a higher build quality than whatever's in your phone or computer you'll get higher fidelity from your digital files.\nIn my experience, if you have good headphones or speakers, it's worth investing in a proper outboard DAC. On the more affordable side, I love the options from AudioQuest ($120), Schiit ($259), and S.M.S.L. ($400). All of these connect to your computer or phone over USB or a digital audio cable. If you are willing to spend even more, the best DAC I've heard is the Chord Electronics Mojo 2 ($775). You can spend more, but higher-priced models typically also come with a headphone amplifier or other amplification on board.\nMany higher-end headphones sound their best when driven by a more powerful amplifier than what's built into your laptop, phone, or tablet. Headphone amplifiers take the signal from your DAC and amplify it with better overall fidelity than the cheapo amps found in most personal electronics. A good headphone amp can really bring more life and a more realistic soundstage to your music, mostly by providing better signal-to-noise ratio.\nAs with headphone amps, some of the best affordable options are from Schiit ($179) and S.M.S.L. ($199). You can spend a ton of money at the high end, but you probably don't need to go higher-end than the Rupert Neve Designs RNHP ($599). Neve was a legendary engineer who designed some of the most famous recording equipment in history, and he didn't cut any corners making his headphone amp either. It sounds warm and open, bringing even the densest mixes to life.\nQuality amps range from fully-fledged streaming models with color displays to old-school tube behemoths. Each has its place. Your main concern when shopping for a stereo amp should be how much power per channel you want and what kinds of analog and digital inputs you need.\nI'm a pretty lazy listener, which is why I love modern streaming amps. These amps have controls for Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and other streaming services built directly into easy-to-use interfaces. Streaming amps have gotten really great over the past few years. It used to be that anything with an internet connection sounded terrible, but that's not the case with the latest models. My high-end favorites right now are the Cambridge Audio Evo 150 ($2,999) and the Naim Uniti Atom ($3,799), which both feature gorgeous color displays and some of the best fidelity (and most glorious knobs) I've ever experienced. Both work with every major streaming service imaginable, and you can connect to them over Bluetooth.\nA good step-down option is Yamaha's R-N1000A ($1,800) stereo network receiver. It's loaded with high-end components like a SABRE ES9090Q DAC for high-resolution digital audio and enough A/B amplification for nearly any pair of speakers in your arsenal. Just as important, it provides rock-steady performance and loads of connection options, from tons of streaming services and internet radio stations to a turntable input and HDMI ARC for connecting to your TV. Its retro design, which skips a color screen for a slim digital display set below tactile knobs, stokes nostalgia while delivering excellent sound quality.\nFor something further stripped down that keeps the sound, Outlaw Audio's RR2160 Mk II ($999) is an intriguing option. The Mk II builds on the rushing clarity and punch for which the original was beloved with updates like hi-res Wi-Fi streaming and Ethernet. This isn’t the pick if you want all the modern trappings—there’s no HDMI ARC port for simplified TV connection, and even streaming stalwarts like Bluetooth and AirPlay are omitted. Instead, this economical power plant rewards your investment with fabulous fidelity and plenty of ways to connect, including a solid phono input for both Moving Magnet and Moving Coil cartridges. You will know it once you hear it, making this a great foundation for a streamlined system that puts the sound front and center.\nIf you don't have that kind of money, I highly recommend checking out the Canadian brand NAD. Its amps, like the NAD C 316 V2 ($399) aren't the flashiest, but they sound amazing for the money. Like the options above, the C 316 even comes with a phono channel on board so you can hook up a record player—a nice touch, seeing how NAD's model doesn't have built-in streaming. If you want to stream, you can find the proper dongle to connect your phone to it.\nVinyl is back! And turntables are more fun—and better-sounding—than ever. If you're looking for a starter deck with audiophile-grade sound quality, I would check out options like the Pro-Ject T1 ($399) or Debut Carbon Evo ($599). On the higher end, we like the Rega Planar 2 ($775), which has a bit more open and dynamic sound, and U-Turn's Orbit Theory ($999), which sounds fantastic thanks to extras like a custom-made magnesium tonearm, the part that sets the needle to the groove.\nIf you have a vintage stereo, it likely has a phono preamp built in, meaning you can plug a turntable directly and get straight to listening. But if you have a modern stereo, you may need to buy a dedicated phono preamp to play your records through your headphones or speakers. Check both your turntable and your stereo, because setups differ, and some turntables come with phono amps inside them that you can activate by flipping a switch. Still, while some built-in options like the one inside the Orbit Theory above perform well, others may not sound as good as you'd like.\nOutboard models like the Pro-Ject Phono Box DC ($129) and Fluance PA10 ($100) will raise the sound of many built-in models, but for truly high fidelity, I recommend more expensive models. My current favorite for the money is the Cambridge Audio Alva Solo ($229), but other acclaimed options include the Rega Fono MM ($445) and Pro-Ject Phono Box S2 Ultra ($349).\nPeople might tell you to spend more money than this on a phono stage, but I generally think those people are foolish. The signal profile for phono stages is set by the RIAA, the recording industry's big trade group. In theory, every good phono amp should sound nearly identical.\nAccessories are where the vast majority of audio snake oil shows up. The worst offender? Cables. The first thing to know is that unless you're running speaker cables for hundreds of feet, you just don't need to worry too much about cable quality. People will try to sell you crazy-expensive cables. Laugh at them and buy standard cabling—which isn't as cheap as it used to be due to the material costs of copper alone, but it’s still pretty affordable.\nYou're essentially paying up for looks and durability, not fidelity; cheaper speaker cables are more susceptible to fraying or breaking, but they carry audio signals just as well. Just buy modern wire and you'll be fine. Anyone who tells you otherwise doesn't understand physics.\nI also recommend grabbing some banana plugs, which you can easily twist speaker wire ends into to make quick plug-and-play connections between your amp and speakers.\nIn terms of sources, I'm a die-hard vinyl and Spotify listener, so I typically enjoy music in those two ways. I know Spotify's streams are compressed, but even through high-end gear, I can't hear any degradation on most tracks. (You probably can't, either.)\nI will say that a good portable player like the Astell & Kern SP3000 ($3,999) is a great option if you're on the go, though in most cases, your phone will provide excellent digital audio quality via its USB port.\nThere are also excellent new plug-and-go DACs made just for mobile phones. I've never used one, but the Chord Mojo 2 ($403) is beloved by many. I also like the THX Onyx ($200), which comes with a standard USB adapter in addition to USB-C, so you can also use it with iPhones and laptops.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nPizza night? Don’t open Uber Eats or DoorDash. The 44-year-old California chain called Pizza My Heart now lets you text a number and chat with an artificial intelligence chatbot to place your order. The chatbot’s name is Jimmy the Surfer, a nod to a recurring character from the company's old TV commercials.\nI texted “Jimmy” and asked if I could get a pineapple and anchovy pizza, then followed up asking if that was a good combo. “Pineapples and anchovies can make for a bold combination! It's all about that mix of sweet and salty flavors. Some folks dig it, while others have different tastes.” A political answer. After some suggestions, I asked Jimmy for a picture of one of his recommendations and he sent over a beaut. Finally, I picked a pie and asked for delivery—it wasn't clear how I was supposed to pay, so I asked and Jimmy clarified I could pay the delivery driver with cash or a credit card upon arrival.\nThis chatbot experience lives alongside several other ways to order from the pizza chain, including delivery apps, the company's website, and even traditional phone calls with a real human. (Pizza seems ripe for automation; Domino's has previously experimented with Alexa integration and text-to-order systems.)\nBut Palona AI—the company whose technology powers Jimmy—believes its solution can alleviate work for people in the store, make the ordering experience richer for the customer, and help brands form a deeper bond with their clientele.\nThe team behind Palona AI, which emerged from stealth mode last week after announcing $10 million in seed funding, has an impressive pedigree. CEO and cofounder Maria Zhang previously was a vice president of engineering at Google, general manager of the AI for Products group at Meta, and the chief technology officer at Tinder. Steve Liu, Palona's chief scientist, had a similar role at Samsung and is a professor at McGill University. CTO Tim Howes is the co-inventor of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and was the CTO at both Netscape and HP.\nZhang says Palona AI is already in use with a small business called MindZero, a contrast therapy spa in South Carolina, and will soon be deployed on the website of Wyze, the company known for its affordable security cameras. I tried the experience with MindZero's chatbot, which is accessible if you directly message the brand on Instagram. That's the thing about Palona—it can take various forms depending on the brand's needs. For Wyze, it will appear as a little chat window on the company's homepage. For Pizza My Heart, there's a dedicated number you can text or call. For MindZero, it's injected into the company's DMs.\nI asked MindZero's chatbot what the therapy does and how much sessions cost and had a back-and-forth not unlike what I had with Jimmy. Zhang says people are asking more questions than they did to a human person over the phone, and they're asking questions they didn't ask before. That includes “Can I be naked in the sauna,” which Zhang posits is a question someone might have felt a little awkward to ask a real human but had no such qualm asking over an Instagram DM. (It's worth noting that it wasn't clear I was chatting with an AI chatbot until I asked MindZero if it was a bot. Jimmy also did not indicate that it was an AI bot.)\nZhang says Palona AI is trying to help brands strengthen their identity and name recognition. A company like Wyze may be perceived as just a white-labeling outfit for Amazon, one of many faceless providers of smart home hardware. Also, Wyze's reliance on the mega-retailer means it has less access to customers and customer data. Deploying Palona's chatbot—whether through Wyze's website or social channels—can craft an identity consumers interact with and potentially help those shoppers form a stronger connection with the brand.\nPalona is trained on the brand's existing catalog and knowledge base and is designed to then be a personalized sales agent. The tech is powered by several large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, but Howe says the company has a separate patent-pending model that acts as a supervisor for all conversations. So if the chat deviates from all things Wyze, the supervisor model knows how to bring it back around to stay on topic. Zhang says Palona is built with an \"emotional intelligence\" language model designed to be effective in sales; the bot is familiar with things like humor, modern messaging etiquette, and “gentle persuasion.”\nWyze's chatbot is personified as a wizard, so its responses are on theme. When I asked it what the best security camera was, it said, “Let me guide you through some enchanting options.” The results were all obviously Wyze products, but that doesn't mean you can't ask about competitors. When I asked if the Nest Cam is better, the Wyze Wizard offered up pros for Wyze's Cam V4 and a few for the Nest Cam but ultimately said the Nest has a heftier price. “Ultimately, if you're seeking magical protection without breaking the bank, Wyze Cam V4 stands out as a beloved choice by many.”\nIt also uses that opportunity to upsell Wyze's subscription plan. Almost every time I asked a product-related question to Wyze's Wizard, it ended with a recommendation to snag Wyze's Cam Plus Plan. (Just like a real salesperson!) There's a memory capability in Palona too. It can build a customer profile so the chatbot can remember your preferences the next time, though it may be more useful for Jimmy the Surfer to remember that you like pineapple pizza than for Wyze's Wizard to know your security camera concerns.\n“We believe that this is going to be the preferred interactive model for consumers,\" Zhang says, citing that younger people are faster to embrace conversational interfaces. Think about asking ChatGPT a question versus a traditional Google Search. Now you can ask a brand directly anything about its catalog instead of trying to find it through a normal Amazon search, or at least that's what Palona envisions.\nPalona AI isn't the first or only company to employ AI as a salesperson—Big Sur AI is another that promises a similar chat-style experience that lets you ask questions about products but is also trained to help companies boost sales. Unlike human salespeople, these AI bots don't get a commission. That just might make them all the more enticing for businesses to use.",

    "content_text": "This week, some auto industry observers felt a creeping sense of déjà vu. Seemingly out of nowhere, a Chinese firm made international headlines by besting Western companies at the tech they supposedly invented.\nNo, it wasn’t BYD, the 20-year-old automaker that gained sudden global recognition in recent years as it began to export low-price electric vehicles all over the world. (BYD built more electric vehicles in 2024 than Tesla.) This week’s buzz was about DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that shocked techies when it released a new open-source artificial intelligence model with seemingly a fraction of the funding US competitors have hoovered up to build their own. DeepSeek’s success saw US tech stocks slide earlier this week, and investors scramble to reexamine their bets.\nIn some ways, experts say, the startup’s success follows the auto industry’s playbook. And the lesson was similar: Chinese firms can still build it better and more cheaply. “There is an underestimation of Chinese innovation and ingenuity,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow researching Chinese policy at the nonprofit Center for Strategic and International Studies. “There is resourcefulness even when there may not be access to the best technology.”\nMany of China’s major global economic success stories have emerged out of a similar national strategy, says Susan Helper, an economist with Case Western Reserve University who studies global supply chains and manufacturing and worked on EV policy in the Biden administration. Cars, solar panels, batteries, steel: “It’s basically, decide on an industry that's critical, and put a lot of money towards it for a long time,” she says. (Compare that with the US approach to cars, “where we change our minds on electric vehicles every few years.”)\nIn the case of cars, the Chinese government has for nearly two decades subsidized electric-vehicle-makers, given tax breaks to electric vehicle customers, and created policies that require the entire country to reduce emissions and go electric—a push in the EV direction. Chinese AI investment is much more recent, but growing bigger. In the past decade, the Chinese government has poured over $200 billion into AI-related firms, Stanford researchers estimate. Just this month, it announced a new $8.2 billion AI investment fund.\nAdditionally, Helper says, Chinese industry benefits from blurrier boundaries between the government, private firms, and the military.\nThe result is an AI ecosystem that’s certainly not identical to the auto one, but has a few echoes. The history of the Chinese auto industry demonstrates sophisticated research networks and firms’ abilities to build on the success of their predecessors, says Kyle Chan, a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University who writes about Chinese industrial and climate policy. Witness the success of Geely, which began the late 1980s as a refrigerator parts company before transitioning to autos in 1997. For its first four years, it didn’t actually have a license to operate in China; today, it produces 3.3 million vehicles and sells internationally, in addition to owning major stakes in Volvo, Polestar, and Aston Martin. Geely and other automakers that emerged in the same time frame—Chery, BYD, Great Wall Motor—have now produced a new wave of manufacturers. Today, about 100 domestic brands are selling in China.\nSimilarly, research papers involving DeepSeek employees show the startup’s workers are also embedded in the same networks as the larger and more established Chinese tech giants that came before, including ByteDance and Baidu. The startup seems to have recruited young people from the same well-regarded, state-run universities, including Tsinghua University and Zhejiang University.\nChinese automakers “built on the foundation that was there before,” says Chan. Now, “DeepSeek is one of many startups that have emerged that benefited from an earlier generation of tech foundation builders.” Because of that deepening bench of technology talent, Chan says, there is no guarantee that just because DeepSeek seems to be winning Chinese AI right now means it’ll be winning next year, or even next month.\nThe major difference between the growth of homegrown Chinese auto and AI industries, of course, is speed. Automotive supply chains are global and complex, and building them required marshaling not only new software, but also battery minerals, battery mineral processing capabilities, parts suppliers, and factories. So maybe it is no surprise: It took Chinese firms many years to develop a domestic technology that could give other nations a run for their money. “This was a slow-moving train,” says Mazzocco.\nChinese large language models, by contrast, have emerged very quickly. “Everything is just compressed now. It’s happening much faster,” says Chan. The biggest lesson seems to be that, globally, everyone should start paying attention.",

(BYD built more electric vehicles in 2024 than Tesla.) This week’s buzz was about <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/deepseek/\">DeepSeek</a>, a Chinese startup that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-app-popular-viral/\">shocked techies</a> when it released a new open-source artificial intelligence model with seemingly <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-china-model-ai/\">a fraction of the funding</a> US competitors have hoovered up to build their own. DeepSeek’s success saw US tech stocks slide earlier this week, and investors scramble to reexamine their bets.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In some ways, experts say, the startup’s success follows the auto industry’s playbook. And the lesson was similar: Chinese firms can still build it better and more cheaply. “There is an underestimation of Chinese innovation and ingenuity,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow researching Chinese policy at the nonprofit <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.csis.org/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.csis.org/\" href=\"https://www.csis.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a>. “There is resourcefulness even when there may not be access to the best technology.”</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Many of China’s major global economic success stories have emerged out of a similar national strategy, says Susan Helper, an economist with Case Western Reserve University who studies global supply chains and manufacturing and worked on EV policy in the Biden administration. Cars, solar panels, batteries, steel: “It’s basically, decide on an industry that's critical, and put a lot of money towards it for a long time,” she says. (Compare that with the US approach to cars, “where we change our minds on electric vehicles every few years.”)</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">In the case of cars, the Chinese government has for nearly two decades subsidized electric-vehicle-makers, given tax breaks to electric vehicle customers, and created policies that require the entire country to reduce emissions and go electric—a push in the EV direction. Chinese AI investment is much more recent, but growing bigger. In the past decade, the Chinese government <a href=\"https://sccei.fsi.stanford.edu/china-briefs/government-venture-capital-and-ai-development-china\">has poured over $200 billion</a> into AI-related firms, Stanford researchers estimate.

    "content_text": "Two years ago, developer Valentin Squirelo went on a mission. With Twitch fans at his side, he and his viewers began work on a face-recognition program that allows disabled individuals to control game inputs through their expressions. For Squirelo and his community, the program—dubbed PlayAbility—was the answer to the limitations of accessible hardware.\n“We are huge believers of connecting everything together,” Squirelo says. “We have created PlayAbility not to replace everything but to connect with everything. So that's why we choose to focus on face gestures, being able to move analog triggers, analog sticks, stuff that you can't really do with other software.”\nHaving software that can enable a player to use facial movements rather than a game controller is huge. Despite being designed for disabled gamers, Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Controller and PlayStation's Access Controller don’t work for everyone. They're also cost-prohibitive for some players.\nOther adaptive third-party controllers exist but aren't compatible with all systems. Combine that with the fact that each piece of accessible hardware primarily addresses only a certain set of needs and you’re left with a scenario where there’s no universal device that can serve the more than 450 million disabled players who exist worldwide. And it's all but impossible to create one.\n“When you’re looking at accessible hardware, the number one thing that you need to do is look at your client first,” says Erik Johnson, an occupational therapist and the chief medical officer of Warfighter Engaged, a nonprofit that makes modified game controllers for veterans. “Time and time again, what I will find is that people will try and match the hardware with the client rather than the client with the hardware. In the community of people with disabilities, there’s always going to be something they can’t do.”\nPlayAbility, Squirelo hopes, can bridge the gap between accessible hardware and disabled individuals who need it.\nSquirelo’s passion for accessibility is twofold. He grew up around friends and family members living with disabilities and also had ADHD. Beyond that, he has a strong desire to help people. The release of PlayAbility, which began rolling out late last year, is the culmination of years of collaborative efforts with his Twitch community to create a program that pushes the boundaries and understandings of accessible software.\n“I always had a community on Twitch of people with disabilities and we were already trying to find stuff,” he says. Those players have been helping Squirelo from the start, offering advice, testing new features, and ultimately giving people tools to help them play.\nSquirelo’s creation attempts to target the individualistic nature of the disabled experience. While adaptive hardware like the Xbox Adaptive Controller and PlayStation’s Access Controller offer customization through different buttons, switches, sticks, and button placement, disabled players are still limited to aspects like desk space, individual strength and energy levels, and even their finances. A basic PlayAbility account is free, and lets players control pretty much any game available on PC through whatever facial motions they have.\nFor Eduard Poch, Squirelo’s vision is clearly working. As a kid, Poch's strength and dexterity allowed him to use standard controllers. Yet, as he grew older and his disability progressed, restricting his hand movements, he needed to rely on adaptive equipment. While accessible hardware was beneficial, his individualistic experience prevented him from fully using devices on the market.\n“That's why I bought a computer, because it was easier for me to use the keyboard and mouse,” Poch says. “Even so, I have trouble reaching certain buttons, since I can only have one hand on the left part of the keyboard. Thanks to PlayAbility, I can use a larger number of buttons immediately with a simple movement of the face.”\nPoch’s experience of buying numerous devices to find the right solution speaks to an issue every disabled person encounters in gaming: the cost of playing. For those who rely on fixed incomes, they can expect to spend upwards of $300 for a complete Xbox Adaptive Controller setup, and approximately $250 for a complete set of Access Controllers. Combine that with the need to purchase additional switches, buttons, and sticks from third-party vendors, and adaptive equipment can cost the same as a console.\nPlayAbility costs significantly less. Even the unlimited premium plan is just a one-time payment of €129 ($132). The only equipment needed is a standard web cam. And while the cost of PlayAbility is an expense that disabled players must account for, it pales in comparison to finding an adaptive hardware setup that may not even work as an individual's disabilities progress.\nIn some of the program’s promotional materials, PlayAbility refers to the technology used as “cutting-edge AI,” but Squirelo admits the technology behind the software isn’t the high-powered stuff people think of when they hear “AI” these days. “We are using computer vision in a way, but we can call it AI,\" he says. Instead, PlayAbility functions using algorithms that translate facial movements into game actions. This was especially beneficial when it came to the cost of developing the program.\n“We don't need to buy expensive hardware,” he said. “For me, the most essential benefit of using AI is to bring technology without [that] expense. We don't need to adapt for the people. It's automatically adapted to people.”\nAs Poch praises PlayAbility’s function, not every user experience is the same. Marijin Rongen, the news editor of gaming site Can I Play That?, says PlayAbility’s face-recognition software struggles to accurately detect those with facial differences. (Full disclosure: This writer was previously an editor at Can I Play That?) Currently, the program greatly benefits motor-related disabilities but cannot account for all forms of physical disabilities. And even though Rongen acknowledges its importance, its flaws demonstrate the multifaceted nature of disabilities.\n“My face is asymmetrical, with features on my right side being somewhat less developed (smaller) than on my left,” Rongen says. “Due to this, the software detects certain gestures by default even while my expression is neutral. Performing facial gestures, like moving my mouth a certain way, causes several other gestures to trigger as well. This does limit the number of different gestures I can map to actions and perform with comfort and accuracy.”\nPoch and Rongen's experiences with PlayAbility highlight the current dilemma of accessible equipment. There is no perfect solution, and players often need to rely on both hardware and software to play games.\nThe relationship between hardware and software is equally similar and distinct—both serve the disabled community, but both serve in different ways, with some individuals requiring one over the other.\nOf the two first-party devices currently on the market, the Xbox Adaptive Controller embraces full customization, but sacrifices the compact layout of a standard controller that can benefit those with limited reach. Meanwhile, PlayStation’s Access Controller's nine buttons are more akin to a traditional PS controller, but it doesn't offer every function of a DualSense, forcing disabled players to either purchase a second Access Controller or sacrifice actions in a game.\nRegardless of hardware or software, more choice is crucial to creating an accessible industry. Thanks to playAbility, disabled individuals can access games through software alone, or with a combination of both hardware and software. That’s what Squirelo wants. Whether it’s through casual play or therapeutic treatments, PlayAbility has the potential to revolutionize the way the gaming industry approaches accessibility.\n“In the last few months we started working with many people with cognitive disabilities, developmental disabilities,” Squirelo says. “We are working with kids with autism and it's so good for them to be able to have feedback and real-time interaction between moves. We see so much potential for this. But at this point, I think my goal is that we can all play together on a Sunday afternoon.”\nPlayAbility is not the ultimate solution but rather a bridge that creates a more inclusive and accessible environment between disabled individuals and the games they play. Will it successfully break down every barrier? No. And that's ultimately OK. Choice will do more for accessibility than a single device or piece of software. As Johnson notes, the goal of the gaming industry isn't to own the rights to accessibility—it's to let people play, and more importantly enjoy, games.\n“PlayStation wants it, Xbox wants it, individual game developers want it,\" Johnson says. “You'll see a lot of people saying ‘How did you do that?’ and nobody says ‘We're not going to tell you because it's a trade secret.’”",

    "content_text": "Dr. Phil filming a ride-along with ICE agents, interviewing apparent migrants, and making it look like an episode of Cops feels like something I’d dream up after taking a little too much melatonin and scrolling TikTok before bed.\nBut instead, the “contentification” of President Donald Trump’s policy is indeed the logical next step for a team that won the election with the help of influencers and content creators. Following suit, Trump’s cabinet has basically created the White House’s own cinematic universe.\nOnly a few days after her confirmation, Kristi Noem, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security secretary, was filmed alongside Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducting an operation. “I’m here in New York City,” Noem told the camera in a vertical video, wearing a bulletproof vest and with a fresh blowout. “We’re getting these dirtbags off these streets.”\nBack in December, I wrote that we should not only expect the government to continue its work with influencers but also to become influencers themselves. This week it became clear that this is what the Trump administration has been planning to do with its cabinet leaders all along. They’re not just leading the government, they’re making content while doing it.\nLook at who Trump nominated for cabinet positions. Nearly across the board, these nominees have experience playing it up for the camera. Noem is a MAGA media veteran, often appearing on networks like Newsmax to discuss topics of the day. Linda McMahon, wife to former WWE CEO Vince McMahon, has gotten in the wrestling ring a time or two herself. Over the course of his presidential campaign, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. couldn’t get enough of the media, appearing on Joe Rogan’s podcast and anywhere else that would have him. And of course, Pete Hegseth is a former Fox News host. On Tuesday, CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter wrote that these ICE raids were crafted with television and the internet in mind.\nBefore his first week in office, Trump had played casting director. Now, we’re getting the pilot episodes.\nStill, it’s not like all that much has changed in terms of digital infrastructure at these agencies. It might just be that the GOP is doing it better—and giving their audience what it wants. Even under the Biden administration, DHS and ICE organized ride-alongs with the media, especially with MAGA-friendly broadcasters like Fox News. The agencies would often post photos of enforcement officers cuffing alleged migrants on platforms like X as well. Most of the multimedia staffers are career employees with few slots for political appointees, according to a source familiar with DHS’s public affairs office.\nBut as Stelter wrote yesterday, the tone of the content is different. And that’s likely a result of the onscreen talent. You’re going to get an entirely different product when working with media veterans like Dr. Phil and Noem. The only Biden cabinet secretary that could rival those two was Pete Buttigieg.\nWhile all of this is happening, the Democrats are waiting to elect a new director before they can even think about casting. On Saturday, Democrats will be voting on their next party chair. There are nearly a dozen people running to fill the spot, but the election is mainly seen as a two-man race between Wisconsin party chair Ben Wikler and Ken Martin, a DNC vice chair.\nWikler, Martin, and many other candidates appeared on a virtual forum Tuesday night specifically focused on the DNC’s future in tech and media. For about an hour, they were asked how they would revamp the party’s data infrastructure and tackle new media. Many of them appeared anxious to take it on.\nWhen I first started covering this beat, Wikler was constantly pitched to me as an example of a Democratic party official who was doing digital the right way. I spoke with him in December, where he reinforced that Democrats needed to respond to the changing media environment quickly if they planned to win elections in the near future. On Tuesday night, Wikler went on to suggest that the DNC create its own innovation lab focused on keeping up with their opposition.\n“You need to build a culture of curiosity, innovation, experimentation, and iteration, knowing that many things won’t work,” Wikler said Tuesday night. “So you need to try even more things.”\nMartin wants to do something similar by building an “Information War Room” more focused on fighting misinformation.\n“That Information War Room will become the hub for better, ongoing, constant digital communications with real-time analytics and also with social listening, so we understand where the misinformation and disinformation is being pumped out, and as part of that, we need to recruit trusted messengers, influencers, creators, and their networks to communicate over the long haul,” Martin said.\nThat war room already exists on the right. The Trump campaign hosted influencers for special debate war rooms, and the same person who ran the Trump campaign’s war room has now been appointed “war room director” for the White House.\nFaiz Shakir, a former Bernie Sanders adviser and the executive director of More Perfect Union, is also running for DNC chair, and he sees things differently. Instead of simply partnering with creators, he envisions a DNC that acts as its own media network. “You don't just sprinkle fairy dust on a Mobilize link or YouTube link,” he said. “We should be raising money right now for the national Meals on Wheels Association, Head Start for America, just raise money for them and build engagement. Do actions on the ground with people, send videographers. This is what I'm doing right now at More Perfect Union.”\nOn Saturday, Democrats will choose who they want leading the party and taking on what will likely be a massive digital rebrand. During Tuesday’s forum, many of the candidates promised to move past the “boom-and-bust” periods of investing in digital and then stripping programs down to the bones between election cycles.\nBut it’s hard to imagine they’ll be able to keep up. Republicans have invested in this for years, and Trump has clearly brought it all to the White House. Plus, season two has just begun.\nThe Chatroom\nEarlier this week, Ryan Broderick, who writes the fantastic Garbage Day newsletter, posted about how difficult it’s been to keep up with all of the news coming out of the White House. I’ve made a career out of staring at news on the computer (amongst other things), and my feeds were full of an unending cycle too.\nSo I want to check in. Are you even trying to keep up with all of this? Gone full Luddite? Or maybe you’ve created the ultimate anti-brain-rot system and every piece of verifiable Trump news flows directly through your Neuralink chip and into your head.\nYou can leave a comment or send your thoughts to mail@wired.com.\nWIRED Reads\nElon Musk Lackeys Have Taken Over the Office of Personnel Management: Musk allies have flooded the OPM with new hires linked to xAI, Neuralink, the Boring Company, and Palantir.\nElon Musk Is Running the Twitter Playbook on the Federal Government: My colleague Zoë Schiffer, who wrote an entire book on Musk’s Twitter takeover, blogged about how the US federal government is following the same playbook the billionaire applied to the social media platform.\nFederal Spending Freeze Threatens Ecosystems and Public Safety: The White House’s funding freeze stops funding for disaster relief, clean drinking-water programs, and apparently the Green New Deal, which was never passed.\nWant more?

    "content_text": "For reasons that were not immediately clear, SpaceX founder Elon Musk took to his social media site X on Tuesday evening to make a perplexing space-based pronouncement.\n“The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible. We will do so,” Musk wrote. “Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.”\nNow generally, at Ars Technica, it is not our policy to write stories strictly based on things Elon Musk says on X. However, this statement was so declarative, and so consternation-inducing for NASA, it bears a bit of explication.\nFirst of all, the most plausible explanation for this is that Elon is being Elon. “He’s trolling,” said one of my best space policy sources shortly after Musk’s tweet. After all, the tweet was sent at 4:20 pm in the central time zone, where SpaceX now has its headquarters.\nEven if it is trolling, it will still cause headaches within NASA.\nForemost, NASA has gone to great lengths to stress that the two astronauts referenced here—Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams—are not stranded on the International Space Station. There is some debate about whether there was a period last summer when the pair, who flew to the space station on a Boeing Starliner vehicle in early June, were briefly stranded. That mission was hobbled by technical issues, including problems with Starliner’s propulsion system. (Ultimately, Starliner flew home without its crew.) However, since the arrival of SpaceX’s Crew-9 mission with two empty seats in late September, Wilmore and Williams have had a safe ride home. The Dragon vehicle is presently docked to the space station.\nThen along comes Musk, with one of the world’s loudest microphones, shouting that NASA’s astronauts are stranded and that President Trump wants them saved. It’s a bombshell thing for the founder of SpaceX, who has become a close adviser to Trump, to say publicly.\nIt is also possible that Musk was not trolling and that Trump asked SpaceX to return Wilmore and Williams earlier for political reasons—namely to, in their view, shame the Biden administration.\nNeither NASA nor SpaceX responded immediately to a request for comment on Tuesday evening.\nCould They Come Back?\nIf Trump demanded that NASA bring the astronauts back now, the Crew-9 mission could return to Earth earlier. It is presently scheduled to splash down in the Pacific Ocean in early April. According to NASA, and the astronauts themselves, Wilmore and Williams are doing fine in space. They have plenty of food and clothes, and plenty of work to do. Privately, sources have told Ars the same. Although Wilmore and Williams were not initially expecting to spend 10 months in space, they're taking no serious risks in doing so. In fact, it’s part of their jobs to tackle these kinds of contingencies.\nThe current return date is being driven by the launch of the Crew-10 mission, also on a SpaceX vehicle. This mission is flying a new Dragon spacecraft, and SpaceX previously asked for a little more time to process and prepare the spacecraft for its debut launch. This moved the target for flying this mission from February to March 25. To meet this date, sources indicated that it’s possible SpaceX may need to appropriate a different, previously flown Dragon—possibly the Dragon intended for use by the Axiom-4 mission—to complete Crew-10.\nNASA would very much prefer the four astronauts on Crew-10 arrive before Crew-9 departs. Why? Because if Crew-9 were to depart sooner, it would leave just a single astronaut, Don Pettit, on board the station. Pettit is a very experienced and capable astronaut, but having just a single NASA astronaut on board to operate the US segment of the station is far from optimal. In addition to leaving Pettit in a difficult position, it would cancel a planned spacewalk in March and leave just a single person to prepare a Northrop Grumman cargo spacecraft for departure. This is apparently a big deal.\n“It takes time to load trash; everything has to be packed in certain bags in certain locations for various reasons,” a NASA source told Ars. “For example, any batteries that are being trashed have to be in a fireproof container. Bags have to be loaded in certain locations to maintain the proper center of gravity. And you’ve got seven crew members’ worth of trash that have already been waiting since the last disposal flight.”\nAnother consideration is if Crew-10 were to slip further from its late March launch date. Pettit flew to the space station on a Russian Soyuz vehicle, and it is due to return on April 20. The Soyuz spacecraft is certified to remain in orbit for 210 days, and April 20 is already 221 days after their launch. April 20 is probably a hard end date for that mission.\nSo technically, yes, the “stranded” astronauts on the space station probably could come home as early as next week. But if they were to do so, it would create a lot of headaches for NASA, its international partners, and probably even for Musk’s human spaceflight team at SpaceX.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "The Chinese generative artificial intelligence platform DeepSeek has had a meteoric rise this week, stoking rivalries and generating market pressure for United States–based AI companies, which in turn has invited scrutiny of the service. Amid the hype, researchers from the cloud security firm Wiz published findings on Wednesday that show that DeepSeek left one of its critical databases exposed on the internet, leaking system logs, user prompt submissions, and even users’ API authentication tokens—totaling more than 1 million records—to anyone who came across the database.\nDeepSeek is a relatively new company and has been virtually unreachable to press and other organizations this week. In turn, the company did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment about the exposure. The Wiz researchers say that they themselves were unsure about how to disclose their findings to the company and simply sent information about the discovery on Wednesday to every DeepSeek email address and LinkedIn profile they could find or guess. The researchers have yet to receive a reply, but within a half hour of their mass contact attempt, the database they found was locked down and became inaccessible to unauthorized users. It is unclear whether any malicious actors or authorized parties accessed or downloaded any of the data.\n“The fact that mistakes happen is correct, but this is a dramatic mistake, because the effort level is very low and the access level that we got is very high,” Ami Luttwak, the CTO of Wiz tells WIRED. “I would say that it means that the service is not mature to be used with any sensitive data at all.”\nExposed databases that are accessible to anyone on the open internet are a long-standing problem that institutions and cloud providers have slowly worked to address. But the Wiz researchers note that the DeepSeek database they found was visible almost immediately with minimal scanning or probing.\n“Usually when we find this kind of exposure, it’s in some neglected service that takes us hours to find—hours of scanning,” says Nir Ohfeld, the head of vulnerability research at Wiz. But this time, “here it was at the front door.” Ohfeld adds that the “technical difficulty of this vulnerability is the bare minimum.”\nThe researchers say that the trove they found appears to have been a type of open source database typically used for server analytics called a ClickHouse database. And the exposed information supported this, given that there were log files that contained the routes or paths users had taken through DeepSeek’s systems, the users’ prompts and other interactions with the service, and the API keys they had used to authenticate. The prompts the researchers saw were all in Chinese, but they note that it is possible the database also contained prompts in other languages. The researchers say they did the absolute minimum assessment needed to confirm their findings without unnecessarily compromising user privacy, but they speculate that it may even have been possible for a malicious actor to use such deep access to the database to move laterally into other DeepSeek systems and execute code in other parts of the company’s infrastructure.\n“It's pretty shocking to build an AI model and leave the backdoor wide open from a security perspective,” says independent security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who was not involved in the Wiz research but specializes in discovering exposed databases. “This type of operational data and the ability for anyone with an internet connection to access it and then manipulate it is a major risk to the organization and users.”\nDeepSeek’s systems are seemingly designed to be very similar to OpenAI’s, the researchers told WIRED on Wednesday, perhaps to make it easier for new customers to transition to using DeepSeek without difficulty. The entire DeepSeek infrastructure appears to mimic OpenAI’s, they say, down to details like the format of the API keys.\nThe Wiz researchers say they don’t know if anyone else found the exposed database before they did, but it wouldn’t be surprising, given how simple it was to discover. Fowler, the independent researcher, also notes that the vulnerable database would have “definitely” been found quickly—if it wasn’t already—whether by other researchers or bad actors.\n“I think this is a wake-up call for the wave of AI products and services we will see in the near future and how seriously they take cybersecurity,” he says.\nDeepSeek has made a global impact over the past week, with millions of people flocking to the service and pushing it to the top of Apple’s and Google’s app stores. The resulting shock waves have wiped billions from the stock prices of US-based AI companies and spooked executives at firms across the country. On Wednesday, sources at OpenAI told the Financial Times that it was looking into DeepSeek’s alleged use of ChatGPT outputs to train its models.\nAt the same time, DeepSeek has increasingly drawn the attention of lawmakers and regulators around the world, who have started to ask questions about the company’s privacy policies, the impact of its censorship, and whether its Chinese ownership provides national security concerns.\nItaly’s data protection regulator sent DeepSeek a series of questions asking about where it obtained its training data, if people’s personal information was included in this, and the firm’s legal grounding for using this information. As WIRED Italy reported, the DeepSeek app appeared to be unavailable to download within the country following the questions being sent.\nDeepSeek’s Chinese connections also appear to be raising security concerns. At the end of last week, according to CNBC reporting, the US Navy issued an alert to its personnel warning them not to use DeepSeek’s services “in any capacity.” The email said Navy members of staff should not download, install, or use the model, and raised concerns of “potential security and ethical” issues.\nHowever, despite the hype, the exposed data shows that almost all technologies relying on cloud-hosted databases can be vulnerable through simple security lapses. “AI is the new frontier in everything related to technology and cybersecurity,” Wiz’s Ohfeld says, “and still we see the same old vulnerabilities like databases left open on the internet.”",

DOGE is based out of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, just steps from the White House.\nAt an exclusive black-tie dinner hosted by the Alfalfa Club last week, Musk told associates that he’d even been invited to spend the night in the White House itself in the Lincoln Bedroom.\nThe news shows how deeply Musk has embedded himself in President Donald Trump’s orbit—and how closely he’s following his tried-and-true playbook from Tesla and Twitter (now X).\nDuring busy periods at Tesla, Musk was known for sleeping on the factory floor. “It was my primary residence,” he claimed during an interview with Ron Baron in 2022. He said the move was strategic, as he wanted employees to see him. “This is important because if the team thinks their leader is off somewhere having a good time, drinking Mai Tais on a tropical island, which I definitely could have been doing … since the team could see me sleeping on the floor during shift change, they knew I was there, and that made a huge difference, they gave it their all.”\nThe vision of a leader drinking cocktails on a tropical island resurfaced after Musk became Twitter’s biggest shareholder in the spring of 2022. In text messages to his friend, the podcaster and angel investor Jason Calacanis, Musk said Twitter’s newly appointed CEO Parag Agrawal was on a 10-day vacation in Hawaii. At the time, Musk had been toying with the idea of joining Twitter’s board of directors, but was growing increasingly frustrated with Agrawal. He doubted the two could work together.\n“Btw, Parag is still on a ten day vacation in Hawaii,” Musk told Calacanis. “No reason to cut it short … in your first tour as ceo (!!!),” Calcanis responded, presumably with a hint of sarcasm. “Shouldn’t he be in a war room right now?!?” Musk then said: “Does doing occasional zoom calls while drinking fruity cocktails at the Four Seasons count?” (The messages were later revealed as part of the discovery process in a lawsuit between Musk and Twitter).\nUltimately, Musk decided he could not save Twitter with Agrawal at the helm, and he bought the company instead.\nAfter the acquisition was complete, Musk began sleeping at the Twitter offices in San Francisco. Employees saw him pacing the floor late at night and being escorted to the bathroom by his security guards. He even tried to get a bathroom installed next to his office so he wouldn’t have to trek across the floor during his stays.\nMusk’s lieutenant Steve Davis, CEO of the Boring Company, who has reportedly been recruiting staff to work at DOGE, also temporarily moved into Twitter HQ with his wife and newborn baby.\nEarlier this week, the US Office of Personnel Management, which is already stacked with Musk lackeys, sent an email to federal workers titled “a fork in the road.”\n“The federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work,” the email read. It directed employees to return to the office five days a week, and commit to a culture of excellence, or effectively resign and continue receiving benefits and pay through September.\nThe memo closely echoed a note Musk sent to Twitter staff shortly after buying the company. In that note, sent November 16, 2022, Musk told staffers they’d need to commit to working long, intense hours to realize his new vision for the company—otherwise they should resign. “Going forward, to build a breakthrough Twitter 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be extremely hardcore,” he wrote. “This will mean working long hours at high intensity.

    "content_text": "This story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nA sudden pause in federal assistance is sowing disarray and outrage across the country, throwing into doubt a wide range of programs that help protect Americans from disasters, provide access to clean drinking water and affordable energy and help protect ecosystems, among many other issues.\nThe order, which came in a memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget on Monday, directed agencies across the government to suspend federal assistance that might not be aligned with the policies of President Donald Trump, “including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, [diversity, equity and inclusion], woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.” The Green New Deal, never enacted into law, was a proposal for climate and economic spending.\nThe memo, copies of which were posted by news organizations, directed agencies to review all their assistance programs “and supporting activities consistent with the President’s policies and requirements,” pointing to executive orders Trump has issued covering immigration, foreign aid, energy, climate change and other issues. It ordered agencies to provide detailed information on these programs by February 10 and to “cancel awards already awarded that are in conflict with Administration priorities.”\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the order right before it was set to take effect after groups including the American Public Health Association sued, according to The New York Times. In a separate action Tuesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, said on social media that she and a coalition of states were also suing to block the White House order.\nWhile the memorandum said assistance given directly to individuals, including Medicare and Social Security benefits, is excluded, it gave little guidance for what it would apply to.\nAn accompanying list of instructions shared with Inside Climate News, however, lists more than 2,500 programs at agencies across the government. The instructions include a series of questions for agencies to answer about those programs, including whether they are affected by Trump’s revocation of funding for the US International Climate Finance Plan, impose what the document calls “an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources” or focus on environmental justice.\nThe order to freeze assistance reflects some of the goals of Project 2025, a policy blueprint written by conservatives for a second Trump administration that sought drastic funding cuts and reorganization of the federal government. Russell Vought, one of the blueprint’s coauthors, is Trump’s nominee to lead the office that issued the new order.\nLegal experts, government officials and others across the country were warning Tuesday that the memo could put in jeopardy everything from early childhood education and food assistance programs to efforts to clear land mines in war zones.\nThe list includes a wide array of environmental programs, from state efforts to install drinking water pipes and limit air pollution to disaster recovery programs.\nEnvironmental advocates warned that the order could have immediate and dire consequences for Americans if it takes effect.\n“From the White House, this is the reckless stroke of a pen,” said Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. “On the ground, it’s a cold home in the dead of winter. It’s a child going hungry at school. It’s a family that can’t pay the rent. It’s higher utility costs for low-income households in every state.”\nThe list of programs includes dozens across the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Samantha Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, said the pause on assistance could effectively halt that agency’s programs that help state and local governments prepare for and recover from disasters.\n“I think it’s fair to say that pausing all federal grants would have a horrific effect on the US emergency management system,” she said. “It would make us less prepared for any disasters that happen in the future and would make it even more difficult for disaster survivors who are in the midst of trying to rebuild their lives to do so.”\nThese offices are not focused purely on weather-related disasters, Montano said.\n“We’re also talking about port security grants, terrorism, cybersecurity,” she added. “This is full-on national security being put at risk when you take away these grants.”\nAcross the country, state agencies and nonprofit organizations have already been shut out of a federal system for accessing grant money, said Maria Lopez-Nuñez, a cofounder of Agency, an environmental justice advisory firm. She listed a wide array of programs that were potentially being affected, from a grant in North Carolina to help rural communities gain access to sewers and clean water to state government programs for laying water pipes.\nFor many smaller nonprofits, a delay in accessing federal grant funding could leave them unable to make payroll, she said, or complete their programs.\n“They’re freezing key, necessary grant funding that many states need for vital services,” said Lopez-Nuñez, who was a member of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council during the Biden administration.\nIn North Carolina, where communities are still recovering from Hurricane Helene, a spokesperson for the state Department of Environmental Quality, or DEQ, said the agency “is reviewing and evaluating” the memo and its potential impacts, adding, “Federal funds provide for a significant portion of DEQ’s operating budget as well as billions of dollars for North Carolina communities.”\nThe instructions to agencies listed more than 400 programs under the US Department of Agriculture, from emergency food assistance to support for farmers markets and water-saving initiatives. Also listed is one of the department’s biggest, most popular and effective initiatives, the Conservation Reserve Program.\nMany legal experts said they were skeptical of the legality of suspending funds. While some have said presidents can temporarily withhold spending under some circumstances, others have said the actions directed by the memo clearly violate constitutional boundaries.\n“The law is unequivocal: Congress controls federal spending, and no executive action can bypass this authority,” said Jillian Blanchard, director of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government, in a statement. “This order not only violates the Constitution but threatens critical programs and communities relying on this funding, which will impact hundreds of jobs across the country.”\nThe order comes as some science, environment and energy programs were already suspending their work. On Monday, NPR reported that the National Science Foundation had canceled its grant review panels scheduled for this week. Multiple news organizations have reported that the Department of Energy has suspended billions of dollars in loans, grants, and other spending.\nInside Climate News reporters Georgina Gustin and Lisa Sorg contributed to this article.",

    "content_text": "“We're making new Pebble watches,” writes original Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky on the “rePebble” launch page.\nEight years after Pebble's time as an upstart watchmaker came to an end, Migicovsky says that he's working with a small team on “a Pebble-like smartwatch that runs open source PebbleOS.” There should be some new features, but new watches would stay “true to the core Pebble vision.” With enough sign-ups, the site claims, that watch gets built.\nPebble, launched in 2012, was one of the first smartphone-era smartwatches, selling 2 million models and serving as an early success story for hardware crowdfunding. After the relatively inexperienced hardware firm ran into funding gaps and stiff competition from the Apple Watch, Pebble stopped making its own watches after an IP-only sale to Fitbit in 2016. Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, gaining some original Pebble workers as well, who then helped the Rebble project launch replacement web services for the watch and kept the watch working on the newest Android phones.\nKeeping Things Simple\nWhy would someone want to make 2016's e-paper watches again? One big reason is that Google, pushed along by its in-house Pebble vets and Rebble volunteers, has released most of the source code for Pebble's operating system. It's missing some blobs of proprietary chipset and Bluetooth stack code, but it can be built, if not fully compiled. There is “a non-trivial amount of work to do in finding replacements” for those pieces, as well as bringing years-old source code up to date, Google's post notes. But anyone who wants to make a Pebble-ish watch can now use Pebble's code.\nWith that code, Migicovsky can address the second reason for a new Pebble—nothing has really replaced the original. On his blog, Migicovsky defines the core of Pebble's appeal: always-on screen, long battery life, a \"simple and beautiful user experience\" focused on useful essentials, physical buttons, and \"hackable,\" including custom watch faces.\nMigicovsky writes that a small team is tackling the hardware aspect, making a watch that runs PebbleOS and “basically has the same specs and features as Pebble” but with “fun new stuff as well.” Crucially, they're taking a different path than the original Pebble company:\nStill Not an Apple Watch—by Design\nArs Technica asked Migicovsky by email if modern-day Pebbles would have better interoperability with Apple's iPhones than the original models. “No, even less now!” Migicovsky replied, pointing to the Department of Justice's lawsuit against Apple in 2024. That lawsuit claims that Apple “limited the functionality of third-party smartwatches” to keep people using Apple Watches and then, as a result, less likely to switch away from iPhones.\nThe core functionality Migicovsky detailed on his post, he wrote, was still possible on iOS. Certain advanced features, like replying to notifications with voice dictation, may be limited to Android phones.\nMigicovsky's site and blog do not set a timeline for new hardware. His last major project, the multi-protocol chat app Beeper, was sold to WordPress.com owner Automattic in April 2024, following a protracted battle with Apple over access to its iMessage protocol.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "Brandon Russell, arguably one of the most influential figures in the American neofascist revival of the past decade, is on trial this week over an alleged plot to knock out Baltimore’s power grid and trigger a race war.\nThe 29-year-old cofounder of the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi guerrilla organization that was responsible for five homicides and a number of bomb plots before the FBI dismantled it in 2020, Russell was arrested by federal agents in February 2023 along with his girlfriend, Sarah Clendaniel. If convicted of his charges of conspiring to destroy an energy facility, Russell could face 20 years behind bars thanks to a prior conviction and the potential penalty for his current charges.\nRussell’s case represents one of the last gasps of the Biden administration’s hard-charging approach to tackling violent far-right extremism that is all but guaranteed to change during US president Donald Trump’s second term in office. It also offers a unique look inside federal law enforcement’s investigation into an insidious accelerationist propaganda network that mixes neo-Nazi ideology with nihilist, Columbine-style violence to inspire mass casualty events in the United States and beyond.\nRussell allegedly hatched the plot to black out Baltimore while, according to prosecutors, participating in a noxious, prolific propaganda network hellbent on fomenting violence and chaos. The Terrorgram Collective, which took its name following a massive influx of neo-Nazis to Telegram at the end of the last decade, ran several channels on the messaging app and developed a series of “how-to” domestic terrorism manuals that sought to inspire disaffected young men and women into committing mass casualty events. Terrorgram is currently designated a “tier one” extremism threat by the US Department of Justice.\nTo date, Terrorgram has released four publications—a blend of ideological motivation, mass-murder worship, neofascist indoctrination, and how-to manuals for chemical weapons attacks, infrastructure sabotage, and ethnic cleansing. Court records indicate there are at least three unreleased Terrorgram Collective compendiums, including “The Saint Encyclopedia” of the far-right mass killers they venerate, including Anders Breivik, Brenton Tarrant, and Timothy McVeigh; and “The List,” a collection of politicians, government officials, business leaders, journalists, activists, and other people deemed legitimate assassination targets.\nThe screeds appear to have directly inspired a series of ideologically motivated attacks around the world, including a 2022 mass shooting at an LGBTQ bar in Bratislava, Slovakia, successful attacks on power infrastructure in North Carolina and similar failed plots in Baltimore and New Jersey, and a stabbing spree in the Turkish city of Eskisehir. There are currently more than a dozen separate federal prosecutions around the United States that involve people alleged to be core Terrorgram Collective members or individuals allegedly inspired toward violent attacks on infrastructure or civilians.\nIn one of the Biden administration’s last policy moves against right-wing extremism, on January 13, the State Department formally classified the Terrorgram Collective as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, a listing usually reserved for militant groups that hold territory and have a formal real-world paramilitary structure as opposed to a loose propaganda network that seeks to inspire mass casualty events. While it is not unique—the British Home Office formally proscribed Terrorgram as an extremist organization last May, and Russell’s Atomwaffen Division was banned by the UK, Australia, and Canada—it is likely to be the last such action taken toward neo-Nazi groups by the United States government for the foreseeable future.\nThe Trump administration appears to be engaged in a wholesale shift away from violent far-right extremism, best illustrated by the unprecedented pardons given to more than 1,500 individuals charged or convicted of crimes during the failed insurrection of January 6, 2021, as well as the reassignment of senior Justice Department attorneys in the National Security Division.\nIn a set of pretrial hearings and motions over the limits of evidence in Russell’s trial, federal prosecutors convinced US District Court judge James K. Bredar to allow in evidence of Russell’s deep neo-Nazi indoctrination, including background about his founding role in the Atomwaffen Division. Russell’s alleged involvement in the Terrorgram Collective is bolstered by a pendant allegedly recovered by FBI agents in a search of his home after his February 2023 arrest: The necklace is made of swastika-bearing beads that contains a larger golden swastika pendant with “Terrorgram” inscribed along the side.\nThe court is taking extra precautions as the US attempts to convict Russell. Journalists’ use of phones and laptops in the courtroom is forbidden, and the judge granted some witnesses permission to testify anonymously over fears of retaliation by Russell's compatriots, some of whom have indicated in Terrorgram chats cited in court filings that they have sought to identify informants and agents involved in their cases. Clendaniel, Russell’s girlfriend, pleaded guilty in May and was later sentenced to 18 years in federal prison. It is unclear whether she will be one of the witnesses testifying against Russell.\nThe prosecution of Russell also offers insight to how American law enforcement and intelligence agencies collaborate with their foreign counterparts to combat the transnational far-right milieu that spawned the Terrorgram Collective.\nIn an unusual alliance over the past two years, lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project weighed in on Russell’s behalf during pretrial motions in an effort to reveal evidence of warrantless surveillance of the fascist figurehead by either the National Security Agency or its counterparts. Although Judge Bredar ultimately denied the ACLU’s efforts on the grounds that the material was classified, the government’s response spoke volumes about the intelligence community’s role in surveilling Russell. American intelligence documents reviewed by WIRED show the Five Eyes alliance of American, Canadian, British, Australian and New Zealander intelligence agencies were keeping tabs on the Terrorgram Collective as far back as 2021.\nThe presence of Terrorgram Collective members in Croatia, Denmark, Slovakia, South Africa, Canada, and elsewhere overseas, coupled with the State Department’s designation of the propaganda network as a foreign terrorist organization, also point to additional reasons the group would be subjected to the highest level of official surveillance.\nRussell was on court supervision when he was picked up for the Baltimore plot nearly two years ago. In 2018, he was convicted on federal charges for possession of homemade hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, a highly unstable compound. He served a little over three years in prison and was released in August 2021.

    "content_text": "Each year, about 185,000 people in the United States undergo amputation. Nearly half of those are due to injured blood vessels cutting off circulation to a limb. Surgeons can transplant an intact vein from somewhere else in a patient’s body to avoid amputation, but not everyone has a suitable vein to harvest.\nA new advance in tissue engineering could help. In December, the Food and Drug Administration approved a bioengineered blood vessel to treat vascular trauma. Made by North Carolina–based biotech company Humacyte, it’s designed to restore blood flow in patients with traumatic injuries, such as from gunshots, car accidents, industrial accidents, or combat.\n“Some patients are so badly injured that they don't have any veins available,” says Laura Niklason, founder and CEO of Humacyte. Even when a patient has a usable one, a vein often isn’t a good replacement for an artery. “Your veins are very thin. They're weak little structures, and your arteries are very strong,” she says.\nNiklason first became interested in the idea of growing spare blood vessels in the 1990s, when she was training to be a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. She remembers observing a patient undergoing a heart bypass, which involves using a healthy vessel to reroute blood flow around a blocked coronary artery. The surgeon opened up both of the patient’s legs, arms, and finally, the stomach, in search of a suitable blood vessel to use. “It was just really barbaric,” Niklason says. She figured there had to be a better way.\nShe started with growing blood vessels in the lab from just a few cells collected from pig arteries. When she transplanted them into the animal, they worked like the real thing.\nAfter those early experiments, it was a long road to an FDA-approved product for humans. Niklason and her team spent more than a decade isolating blood vessel cells from human organ and tissue donors. They tested cells from more than 700 donors and found that those from five of those donors were the most efficient at growing and expanding in the lab. Niklason says Humacyte now has enough cells banked from these five donors to make between 500,000 and a million engineered blood vessels.\nThe company currently makes the vessels in batches of 200, using custom-designed degradable polymer scaffolds that are 42 centimeters long and 6 millimeters thick. The scaffolds are placed in individual bags and seeded with millions of the donor cells. The bags then go into a school-bus-sized incubator to soak in a nutrient bath for two months. While the tissue grows, it secretes collagen and other proteins that provide structural support. Eventually, the polymer scaffold dissolves and the cells are washed away with a special solution. What’s left is “de-cellularized” flexible tissue in the shape of a blood vessel. Because it doesn’t contain living human cells, it won’t cause rejection when implanted into a patient.\n“People have been trying to come up with a tubular material like this one for a long time,” says Anton Sidawy, president-elect of the American College of Surgeons and a vascular surgeon at the George Washington University Medical Center, who isn’t involved with Humacyte.\nCurrently, synthetic alternatives made of Teflon or a type of polyester called Dacron are sometimes used when a patient doesn’t have an available blood vessel. But they’re not ideal. “Every time you put a foreign body in the human body, the chance of infection goes up. Bacteria love to sit on the foreign body and cause an infection,” Sidawy says.\nThe safety and effectiveness of the engineered vessel was tested in 51 civilian patients and 16 military patients with traumatic injuries, and the results were compared with previous studies of people who received synthetic versions. At 30 days after implantation, nearly 92 percent of the vessels remained open and functioning, compared with 79 percent for synthetic grafts. About 4.5 percent of patients required amputation, much lower than the 24 percent in tests of synthetic grafts. In addition, less than 1 percent of the bioengineered vessels became infected compared with more than 8 percent for the synthetic options. The results were published in the journal JAMA Surgery in November.\n“This actually becomes part of the patient's body,” says Michael Curi, chief of vascular surgery at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, who coauthored the paper. “The body grows its own cells into this vessel wall, and it mimics a natural vessel.”\nWhile the December approval means Humacyte’s vessel can only be used in trauma patients, the company is pursuing other uses for its technology. It has tested the bioengineered vessel in patients on kidney dialysis, which requires connecting an artery or vein to a dialysis machine, as well as in individuals with peripheral artery disease, when arteries in the legs or arms become blocked. In monkeys, a smaller version of the engineered blood vessel has also shown promise in treating heart bypass.\n“It’s truly a remarkable scientific achievement,” Curi says. “And in my opinion, it is the future of medicine.”",

    "content_text": "Elon Musk is only one week into his role in President Donald Trump’s new administration, but the US federal government is already rolling out the Twitter playbook to manage its spending and personnel. Just like Musk did when he took over the social media platform, Trump’s team is attempting to drastically reduce the number of government staffers and ensure those who remain are loyal to the president’s agenda.\nOn Tuesday, federal employees received an email that mirrors the “Fork in the Road” missive sent to Twitter (now X) staff shortly after Musk bought the company in 2022. The email asks federal workers to resign by February 6 if they do not wish to return to the office five days a week and commit to a culture of excellence. Those who choose to resign will continue to get pay and benefits until September, according to the memo.\n“The federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work,” reads the email, which was later published on the US Office of Personnel Management website. “Employees will be subject to enhanced standards of suitability and conduct as we move forward.”\nThe news comes as Musk’s minions take over the US Office of Personnel Management, which acts as a human resources department for the federal workforce. Elon Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. The Office of Personnel Management also did not respond to a request for comment.\nMusk and his advisors, including Trump’s newly appointed AI and crypto czar David Sacks, used a remarkably similar strategy at Twitter. About a week after the acquisition was complete, Musk laid off half the workforce. Sacks helped advise him on which teams and people would be cut.\nAbout two weeks later, remaining employees received an email with the subject line “A Fork in the Road.” Musk said that they would need to be “extremely hardcore” in order to realize his vision for Twitter 2.0. This meant “working long hours at high intensity.” He noted that \"only exceptional performance” would receive “a passing grade.\" Employees were asked to opt into this vision via a web form. Anyone who failed to do so by the following day would receive three months severance, Musk said. Thousands of Twitter employees would later sue, arguing that they were not paid their full severance. Musk ultimately was able to get the suit dismissed.\n“We are all shaking our heads in disbelief at how familiar this all feels,” says Yao Yue, a former principal engineer at Twitter. “Except, the federal government and its employees have specific laws in terms of spending, hiring, and firing.”\nIn this case, federal employees are being asked to send an email with the word “Resign” in the subject line in the next 10 days. “Purging the federal government of dedicated career civil servants will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government,” Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal workers, said in a statement. “This offer should not be viewed as voluntary. Between the flurry of anti-worker executive orders and policies, it is clear that the Trump administration's goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.”\nIn the wake of Musk’s ultimatum at Twitter, hundreds of employees resigned—many more than Musk had expected, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. The move caused widespread chaos inside the company as Musk’s lieutenants scrambled to figure out who simply hadn’t filled out the form yet and who was actually leaving the company. In some cases, Twitter employees who had quit were later called and asked to reconsider staying.\nOne former Twitter employee noted that the OPM letter appears slightly more buttoned up than the version they received years ago. “Clearly this was more thought out and went through lawyers unlike what they did with Twitter employees,” says a former engineering manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity as they do not want to incur Musk’s wrath. “I’m sickened to even be part of the connection honestly.”\nThe latest email from the Office of Personnel Management stresses that federal employees must return to the office five days a week, though some may be asked to move to new locations due to “meaningful consolidation and divestitures” of existing buildings. Musk has spoken repeatedly about his distaste for working from home—a practice he has called “morally wrong.” At Twitter, he told workers during an all hands meeting shortly after buying the company that if they could physically make it to an office and chose not to show up, their “resignation” would be accepted. Under former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, employees had been told they could work remotely forever.\nOn Monday, the US Office of Management and Budget (which encompasses Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE) sent a memo abruptly freezing all grants and loans disbursed by the federal government. “Federal agencies must temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for foreign aid, nongovernmental organizations, DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal,” the memo read, according to NBC News.\nThis approach to spending—where a budget starts at zero, and employees have to justify every expense—is called “zero based budgeting,” and it too is a popular Musk tactic.\nOn Tuesday, a subreddit for federal employees was inundated with comments from people discussing the email. “Don’t trust this email, there is no guarantee they will pay you, and they most likely won’t!” wrote one user. “Look at what happened to Twitter employees.”",

    "content_text": "Centibillionaire Elon Musk’s takeover of the former US Digital Service—now the United States DOGE Service—has been widely publicized and sanctioned by one of President Donald Trump’s many executive orders. But WIRED reporting shows that Musk’s influence extends even further, and into an even more consequential government agency.\nSources within the federal government tell WIRED that the highest ranks of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)—essentially the human resources function for the entire federal government—are now controlled by people with connections to Musk and to the tech industry. Among them is a person who, according to an online résumé, was set to start college last fall.\nScott Kupor, a managing partner at the powerful investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, stands as Trump’s nominee to run the OPM. But already in place, according to sources, are a variety of people who seem ready to carry out Musk’s mission of cutting staff and disrupting the government.\nAmanda Scales is, as has been reported, the new chief of staff at the OPM. She formerly worked in talent for xAI, Musk’s artificial intelligence company, according to her LinkedIn. Before that, she was part of the talent and operations team at Human Capital, a venture firm with investments in the defense tech startup Anduril and the political betting platform Kalshi; before that, she worked for years at Uber. Her placement in this key role, experts believe, seems part of a broader pattern of the traditionally apolitical OPM being converted to use as a political tool.\n“I don't think it's alarmist to say there's a much more sophisticated plan to monitor and enforce loyalty than there was in the first term,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.\nGot a Tip?\nAre you a current or former employee with the Office of Personnel Management or another government agency impacted by Elon Musk? We’d like to hear from you.

(Steve Davis, the CEO of the Boring Company, is rumored to be advising Musk on cuts to be made via DOGE and was integral in Musk’s gutting of Twitter, now X, after his takeover of the company in 2022.)\nAccording to the same sources, other people at the top of the new OPM food chain include two people with apparent software engineering backgrounds, whom WIRED is not naming because of their ages. One, a senior adviser to the director, is a 21-year-old whose online résumé touts his work for Palantir, the government contractor and analytics firm cofounded by billionaire Peter Thiel, who is its chair. (The former CEO of PayPal and a longtime Musk associate, Thiel is a Trump supporter who helped bankroll the 2022 Senate campaign of his protégé, Vice President JD Vance.) The other, who reports directly to Scales, graduated from high school in 2024, according to a mirrored copy of an online résumé and his high school’s student magazine; he lists jobs as a camp counselor and a bicycle mechanic among his professional experiences, as well as a summer role at Neuralink, Musk’s brain-computer interface company.\nAmong the new highers-up at the OPM is Noah Peters, an attorney whose LinkedIn boasts of his work in litigation representing the National Rifle Association and who has written for right-wing outlets like the Daily Caller and the Federalist; he is also now a senior adviser to the director. According to metadata associated with a file on the OPM website, Peters authored a January 27 memo that went out under acting OPM director Charles Ezell’s name describing how the department would be implementing one of Trump’s executive orders, “Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce.” This has to do with what’s sometimes known as Schedule F—a plan to recategorize many civil service jobs as political appointees, meaning they would be tied to the specific agenda of an administration rather than viewed as career government workers. The order would essentially allow for certain career civil servants to be removed in favor of Trump loyalists by classifying them as political appointees, a key part of the Project 2025 plan for remaking the government.\n“I think on the tech side, the concern is potentially the use of AI to try and engage in large-scale searches of people's job descriptions to try and identify who would be identified for Schedule F reclassification,” says Moynihan.\nOther top political appointees include McLaurine Pinover, a former communications director for Republican congressman Joe Wilson and deputy communications director for Republican congressman Michael McCaul, and Joanna Wischer, a Trump campaign speechwriter.\n“OPM is not a very politicized organization,” says Steven Kelman, a professor emeritus at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. “My guess is that typically, in the past, there have been only one or maybe two political appointees in all of OPM. All the rest are career. So this seems like a very political heavy presence in an organization that is not very political.”\nAnother OPM memo, concerning the government’s new return-to-office mandate, appears, according to metadata, also to have been authored by someone other than Ezell: James Sherk, previously at the America First Policy Institute and author of an op-ed advocating for the president to be able to fire bureaucrats. Formerly a special assistant to the president during Trump’s first term, he is now a part of the White House Domestic Policy Council.\nThe return-to-office policy, according to the November Wall Street Journal op-ed authored by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is explicitly geared toward forcing the attrition of federal employees.\nLast week, many federal workers received test emails from the email address HR@opm.gov. In a lawsuit filed last night, plaintiffs allege that a new email list started by the Trump administration may be compromising the data of federal employees.\n“At a broadest level, the concern is that technologists are playing a role to monitor employees and to target those who will be downsized,” says Moynihan. “It is difficult in the federal government to actually evaluate who is performing well or performing poorly. So doing it on some sort of mass automated scale where you think using some sort of data analysis or AI would automate that process, I think, is an invitation to make errors.”\nLast week, federal employees across the government received emails encouraging them to turn in colleagues who they believed to be working on diversity, equity, inclusion, and access initiatives (DEIA) to the OPM via the email address DEIAtruth@opm.gov.\n“This reminded me,” says Kelman, “of the Soviet Stalinism of turning in your friends to the government.”\nThe OPM did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the people whom sources say now sit atop the bureaucracy.\n“I am not an alarmist person,” says Kelman. “I do think that some of the things being described here are very troubling.”\nTim Marchman contributed reporting.",

    "content_text": "The volunteer cartographers who power the maps on platforms like Facebook, Lyft, and Strava have been intensely debating over the past week about whether to honor US president Donald Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. When should they update? Will the change affect all of the gulf, or just the US portion? Should it be reflected for everyone, or only Americans?\nThese are some of the questions the cartographers have been asking one another. Their discussions and edit wars provide a glimpse into the confusion over what may be one of the first orders of the new Trump administration generating visible changes across the internet.\nOn OpenStreetMap, a volunteer-run mapping platform that provides cartography data for a number of popular apps, online discussions show some contributors pushed to immediately update the gulf’s name to the Gulf of America. “This isn’t meant as vandalism, but more of starting the discussion,” one user wrote. They tried to make it only the name for English-speaking users, but the change was quickly rolled back by another contributor, who wrote, “Something isn't renamed just because a president says so.”\nThe original submitter replied, referring to Trump’s order, “Well, if he utters the idea in passing during a speech, that's one thing. But signing an EO and moving federal agencies to officially rename it is a vastly different thing. I hope you agree,” replied the original contributor. (They declined to comment beyond their post.)\nIn an executive order issued last Monday, Trump said that rebranding the gulf would recognize “this flourishing economic resource and its critical importance to our nation’s economy and its people.” He also ordered that Alaska’s tallest mountain, Denali, return to being known as Mount McKinley in recognition of former president William McKinley, whom Trump has said he admires. Critics have written off the moves as “very silly” and “petty.” Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum has said the body will continue to be known as the Gulf of Mexico to the rest of the world.\nOn Friday, the Department of the Interior announced that the new names had become official and federal agencies needed to update any relevant signage and paperwork. Private companies, however, aren’t required by law to follow suit. But on Monday, Google Maps became the first major mapping provider to publicly announce that it will switch to the new names for US users as soon as the federal government publishes them to a key database. “When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name,” Google wrote. “Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names.”\nDisputes over names and boundaries are common in the maps industry, with a number of countries having enacted laws requiring mapmakers to adopt specific titles and borders. Trump’s order, in particular, follows scant public input and is disputed even within the US.\nOpenStreetMap has various ways of labeling names. For instance, it’s possible to list Mexico as the colloquial name for the country while also displaying its official name, Estados Unidos Mexicanos, or United Mexican States. Other labels allow for different names to be shown in different countries and languages. Apps that license OpenStreetMap data can choose which of the labels to reflect to their users or add their own naming conventions.\nAltogether, around 10 attempts to change the gulf’s name have been reverted over the past week on OpenStreetMap. Several contributors have contended that OSM should wait for common usage in society to change before making an edit to the main name of the gulf. “OSM’s primary goal is to reflect what people on the ground believe is correct, striving for accuracy and neutrality in the face of diverse perspectives,” says Clifford Snow, a member of the organization’s Data Working Group who has reversed some of the edits allegedly made without consensus.\nA similar back-and-forth has played out over Denali. But reaching agreement may wind up proving difficult. “I do not believe that OSM will ever be able to pick one [name], without offending some user somewhere,” one contributor wrote. “We need a path out of this quagmire that does not involve edit wars.”\nOther contributors discussed when it would be appropriate to make the changes. Mapping providers, including Google, say they follow the US Geological Survey’s Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), but that database hasn’t been updated with the new names yet. Interior Department spokesperson Elizabeth Peace declined to speculate about when USGS staff might get around to processing the updates.\nUnder a 1947 law, decisions about which geographic names the US government will use are to be made by the secretary of the interior and the Board on Geographic Names, or BGN, a panel of officials from a smattering of government agencies. The GNIS is a repository of BGN-approved names.\nAs of Tuesday, at least one listed member of the BGN had received no correspondence or records related to changing the name of the gulf, according to a request filed by WIRED under the Freedom of Information Act. That suggests either that the usual mechanisms have not been engaged, or that some other authority is being exercised to change the official name. The Interior Department spokesperson declined to comment.\nAnother point of uncertainty has been whether the entire gulf should be renamed. The president’s order addressed “the U.S. Continental Shelf area bounded on the northeast, north, and northwest by the States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida and extending to the seaward boundary with Mexico and Cuba.”\nBut as one contributor on OpenStreetMap wrote, “the Gulf of Mexico is much bigger than this. So it seems rather than a renaming, this executive order is creating a new name for a sub area of the Gulf of Mexico.”\nThe White House didn’t respond to WIRED’s request to clarify the intended boundaries for the new name. If the change were to apply to any non-US territory, the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency would have to update what’s known as the Geographic Names Server, a database of names for foreign locations. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency declined to comment.\nMikel Maron, a spokesperson for the OpenStreetMap Foundation, which helps steward the volunteer efforts, says the debate over the Trump order highlights the value of having an open community trying to represent the complexity of the world. For now, their discussion continues. “Ultimately the OSM Foundation Data Working Group has stepped in to put a hold on any big changes in the OSM database until things are more clear,” he says.\nSnow, the working group member, says the trending consensus is leaving the Gulf of Mexico and Denali as the primary names and adding a label to each for the new official US name. But if Gulf of America catches on, the open source map may have to follow.\nAdditional reporting by Tim Marchman.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nHave you been checking out the upcoming Nvidia 50 Series GPUs, but worry your gaming monitor is holding you back? Dell is offering a healthy discount on the Alienware AW3225QF, an impressively equipped gaming panel that will give even the Nvidia RTX 5090 Founders Edition (7/10, WIRED Recommends ) some room to breathe.\nAlienware tends to have pronounced styling, with this screen in particular sporting rounded edges and light-colored panels. If that bothers you, the stand is replaceable for any VESA 100 x 100 mount, and it's not like you'll see the back while using it anyway.\nAt the heart of this gaming monitor, you'll find a slightly curved 4K QD-OLED panel, which should result in deeper, darker black levels, as well as beautifully rich colors. While 32 inches might not be the largest panel size, I think it strikes a nice balance between pixel density and usability. The 240-Hz refresh rate is among the highest available at that resolution, which should give this screen plenty of life over the next few years.\nFor anyone who can't quite keep up with the 240-Hz refresh rate right now, the Alienware has Nvidia G-Sync. This adaptive refresh technology keeps your display's panel tied to the frame rate of the game you're playing, reducing tearing and flickering when the two don't line up. While G-Sync only works with Nvidia graphics cards, AMD users can still take advantage of the VESA AdaptiveSync standard, which has the same core functionality.\nI also appreciate both the inputs provided here, as well as the included cables. Alongside a DisplayPort 1.4 port, you'll find three HDMI 2.1 ports, one with FRL and eARC, as well as a full USB 3.2 Gen 1 hub. Alienware includes the corresponding HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, and USB 3.2 Gen 1 cables, so you don't need to dig around in your bin of old cables wondering which might work.\nIf that all sounds appealing, Dell has the 4K Alienware panel marked down from $1,200 to $900, and then you can use the code MONITORS15 to take an additional 15 percent, bringing the total cost down to just $765. The code will be good through 7 am CST on February 3, but only as long as these stay in stock. Plus, you can get discounts on Dell products year-round with our exclusive Dell coupons.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Dell is offering a healthy discount on the Alienware AW3225QF, an impressively equipped gaming panel that will give even the Nvidia RTX 5090 Founders Edition (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-review/\" target=\"_blank\">7/10, WIRED Recommends</a> ) some room to breathe.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Alienware tends to have pronounced styling, with this screen in particular sporting rounded edges and light-colored panels. If that bothers you, the stand is replaceable for any VESA 100 x 100 mount, and it's not like you'll see the back while using it anyway.</p><p class=\"paywall\">At the heart of this gaming monitor, you'll find a slightly curved 4K QD-OLED panel, which should result in deeper, darker black levels, as well as beautifully rich colors. While 32 inches might not be the largest panel size, I think it strikes a nice balance between pixel density and usability. The 240-Hz refresh rate is among the highest available at that resolution, which should give this screen plenty of life over the next few years.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Dell</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">For anyone who can't quite keep up with the 240-Hz refresh rate right now, the Alienware has Nvidia G-Sync. This adaptive refresh technology keeps your display's panel tied to the frame rate of the game you're playing, reducing tearing and flickering when the two don't line up. While G-Sync only works with Nvidia graphics cards, AMD users can still take advantage of the VESA AdaptiveSync standard, which has the same core functionality.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">I also appreciate both the inputs provided here, as well as the included cables. Alongside a DisplayPort 1.4 port, you'll find three HDMI 2.1 ports, one with FRL and eARC, as well as a full USB 3.2 Gen 1 hub. Alienware includes the corresponding HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, and USB 3.2 Gen 1 cables, so you don't need to dig around in your bin of old cables wondering which might work.</p><p class=\"paywall\">If that all sounds appealing, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/SbYvHH9xeMAbha59MpJ5B7Y57X9NNDFDaTR8KtFQ1gXehJ3EyQtDSzDsyMzDxhrdTFqVRt2vkGDwwcaNXZRak77rAJCxQnt72R1xMPSu3tefzvoWCtobLnfF8TbHJdiXCryQr5FT3Bbgiv7t4RDTYeG8Mb779zMaHyXQY9fWvaAuLyeZqaJHxXJ6415raU2aPw4JTzKjUMAeaB1o3P4jEwRfvGjwjN9RdLVkmisGpPBg22Q4HWmt15hdLTmyhsGUbYo9EsRAQqZbHyfzq1ossUimon9ZcPurafnvvyZU9EwrKLXVyxkYq8jUgKjkUVkK7fxdfGfpK2a2xrcuX79TYeY1N6tM2sM73Awcm1mRj5bUET5camPpsG6QtyBwJSZUbVyHviZjPc2sqrJxR8YMoaUrgWv97QYvXjvhDkVgEq8Z2pvpWCXhcosXz6Yww\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-32-4k-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3225qf/apd/210-blmq/monitors-monitor-accessories\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/SbYvHH9xeMAbha59MpJ5B7Y57X9NNDFDaTR8KtFQ1gXehJ3EyQtDSzDsyMzDxhrdTFqVRt2vkGDwwcaNXZRak77rAJCxQnt72R1xMPSu3tefzvoWCtobLnfF8TbHJdiXCryQr5FT3Bbgiv7t4RDTYeG8Mb779zMaHyXQY9fWvaAuLyeZqaJHxXJ6415raU2aPw4JTzKjUMAeaB1o3P4jEwRfvGjwjN9RdLVkmisGpPBg22Q4HWmt15hdLTmyhsGUbYo9EsRAQqZbHyfzq1ossUimon9ZcPurafnvvyZU9EwrKLXVyxkYq8jUgKjkUVkK7fxdfGfpK2a2xrcuX79TYeY1N6tM2sM73Awcm1mRj5bUET5camPpsG6QtyBwJSZUbVyHviZjPc2sqrJxR8YMoaUrgWv97QYvXjvhDkVgEq8Z2pvpWCXhcosXz6Yww\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Dell has the 4K Alienware panel marked down</a> from $1,200 to $900, and then you can use the code <strong>MONITORS15</strong> to take an additional 15 percent, bringing the total cost down to just $765.

All of the best TVs support 4K, as do most new TV shows and movies, with the exception of traditional broadcasting—and even that is poised to make the jump (eventually). Riding alongside 4K's resolution revolution is HDR (high dynamic range), another exciting video enhancement that's arguably even more impactful to your viewing experience than 4K.\nBut what is HDR, and why is it so integral to getting the best out of modern TVs? It's a common misconception that HDR simply makes things brighter, but it does so much more than that. HDR's key advantage is improved contrast, providing brighter brights, darker darks, and a more expansive color palette to make everything you watch look more realistic. Not all HDR is created equal, however, and you need the proper hardware and video content to take advantage. Here's everything you need to know about HDR to get the most out of your TV time.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nWhat Is HDR for TVs?\nNot to be confused with the camera format of the same name, HDR for TV is both a video and a hardware technology. It requires an HDR-compatible TV and an HDR content source to do its thing. As the name implies, HDR provides a more expansive (and yes, dynamic) range of contrast and colors than its predecessor, SDR (standard dynamic range). This doesn’t mean HDR video makes your TV brighter—rather, it helps to unlock your TV’s brightness potential.\nAt its most basic, HDR content provides a road map for your 4K HDR TV to follow. To an extent, the brighter your TV can get, the more impactful your HDR experience will be. This has its limitations, constrained by both your TV’s maximum or “peak” brightness—the brightest your TV gets in small windows and highlights—and the brightness at which the content was originally mastered.\nAs a general guideline, you'll want a TV with a peak brightness of at least 500 nits (a unit for measuring display brightness) to experience HDR's impact. That shouldn't be difficult, considering that even budget TVs these days regularly meet or surpass that level. That said, HDR's impact is also highly affected by your TV's total contrast, the difference between the brightest and darkest images. For example, HDR content on an OLED TV that provides perfect black levels will look more impactful than on a brighter LED TV with poor black levels and contrast.\nUnlike with SDR content, your HDR TV’s lighting system will be set at full power when viewing HDR content. That’s because video mastered in HDR provides more information to your TV by better adhering to the creator’s intent, so you won't just be blasted with brightness. Instead, HDR video is designed to take full advantage of what your HDR TV can do, coaxing darker black levels and richer shadow detail, brighter and more intense highlights, and more expressive colors thanks to its higher “range” of contrast and color shading than SDR video.\nHDR Formats: HDR10, Dolby Vision, HDR10+\nHDR comes in a variety of formats, from the basic open-source version, HDR10, to the one you've probably heard most about, Dolby Vision. Every HDR TV and content source supports HDR10, so even if you’re watching an HDR video in a format your TV doesn’t support, you’ll still reap the benefits of HDR. The biggest difference comes down to how the HDR metadata is implemented.\nHDR10 is a “static” HDR format, meaning it sets the HDR range for your TV to follow at the outset and doesn't change. Dolby Vision, on the other hand, is a dynamic format that can adjust a compatible TV's HDR road map on the fly for a more finely tuned performance from scene to scene or even frame by frame. Dolby Vision video usually generates its own picture mode on your TV, one that's often more constrained than other formats due to Dolby's specifications. You’ll hear a lot about Dolby Vision's superiority over other formats, and it's the most prevalent dynamic format on most streaming services right now.\nSome TVs, like those made by Samsung, don't support Dolby Vision. Samsung, Panasonic, and 20th Century Fox created their own dynamic HDR format called HDR10+ which, unlike Dolby Vision, is royalty-free. Like its cousin, HDR10+ provides a compatible HDR TV with more finely tuned contrast and color adjustments when viewing supported content than standard HDR10.\nAll things being equal, you're unlikely to see a major performance difference between the two formats right now. Both support the highest peak brightness and color bit depth of the current TV pipeline, at 4,000 nits and 10-bits respectively (more on that below). Dolby advertises support for up to 10,000 nits peak brightness and 12-bit color depth, but since you won't find much (if any) supported content for those specs, any major differences are mostly theoretical at present. The biggest HDR performance boost is more likely to come from the quality of your TV panel and its internal processing. Even basic HDR10 content will look leaps and bounds better than similar SDR content on a great TV.\nOne other HDR format to know is HLG (Hybrid-log Gamma). Developed by the BBC and NHK, this format is royalty-free like HDR10 and HDR10+. It was developed for broadcast TV and is designed to be backward compatible with SDR TVs. Because you'll rarely find HDR broadcasts in the US right now this format is rare, but like HDR10, it's supported by virtually all HDR TVs.\nWhat Is Wide Color Gamut?\nAlongside enhanced resolution, modern 4K HDR TVs allow for more expansive color shading and a higher color bit depth. Where previous displays maxed out around 16.77 million color hues (8-bit depth), today's best TVs can display up to 1.07 billion hues (10-bit depth), also called Wide Color Gamut (WCG). HDR can enhance WCG, as its higher luminance range provides a better display of the full range of colors available in the current TV ecosystem.\nWCG's expanded color spectrum is measured using more advanced display color standards than the previous Rec. 709 standard. These currently include DCI-P3 and the superior BT.2020 (aka Rec 2020), which covers an even wider color space than DCI-P3. It can all get pretty complicated, but the bottom line is, with better brightness and contrast comes the ability to display a higher range of colors. The closer a 4K HDR TV or display gets to producing the full spectrum of the BT.2020 standard, the more vivid and realistic its colors will look.\nAlong with richer and more expressive colors, today's best HDR TVs allow for more intricate shading between colors with WCG content. This allows for images that look more like what we see in real life with less “banding” or visible distortion between color hues. Banding is especially noticeable in images like a fiery sunset or a brightly colored object against a dark background. Banding is still relatively common in HDR, especially with compressed streaming video or lower-quality TVs. You'll get the best colors, contrast, and overall HDR quality from 4K HDR Blu-rays or video files from services like Sony Pictures Core.\nWhere Can I Find HDR Content?\nHDR is now available in a ton of places, from streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, Max, and Amazon Prime to games on systems like the PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series X and S, and PCs. HDR video is often bundled with 4K resolution, but that's not always the case, especially for live broadcasts. Amazon Prime's Thursday Night Football, for instance, is broadcast in HDR but its resolution is currently constrained to 1080p HD likely due to the challenges of 4K video file sizes.\nWhile 4K HDR Blu-rays provide the best HDR experience right now, it's not clear for how much longer. You can find virtually every new film on 4K HDR Blu-ray, some of which (like Mad Max: Fury Road) push HDR to its current limits, but Blu-ray players are becoming increasingly less common. Only a few brands still sell them in the US, including Sony and Panasonic, which makes some of our favorite models. For testing purposes, we use Panasonic's DP-UB820-K and the fancier DP-UB9000, in part because they support all major Blu-ray HDR formats.\nHowever you get your HDR, it's well worth the upgrade. From deeper and more impactful contrast to vastly superior color shading, high dynamic range is arguably the most exciting element in modern display technology, allowing for a more natural and immersive viewing experience. As we move into the next stage of display innovation, from the way video is shot and mastered to the panels on which it's displayed, HDR will help lead the way. And its future is only getting brighter.",

More than 2.1 million battery-powered vehicles are driving around the state, and last fall, over a quarter of new cars sold there were electric. Lawmakers are trying to ensure the future holds even more. In December, California received special permission from the US government to enact regulations that would require automakers to sell only zero-emission new vehicles in the state by 2035.\nThe permission, in the form of a federal “waiver,” should extend well beyond California’s borders. Seventeen other states have said they would follow California’s lead on stricter emissions standards, with 11 targeting the 2035 gas car phase-out. Together, these states account for more than 40 percent of US new light-duty vehicle registrations.\nOr maybe not. Last week, in a wide-ranging executive order targeting green energy policies, the Trump administration said it would seek to “terminate” state emissions waivers “that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles.” The order, at this point more political messaging document than anything with the force of law, puts California’s clean car goals in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. Whoever wins this fight could determine the future of electric vehicles not just in the US, but—given the number of vehicles both sold and made in the country—globally, too.\nThe Trump administration has not yet officially moved to revoke the waiver, but California says it will not back away from its more stringent vehicle emissions standards. “California will continue to defend its longstanding right and obligation to protect the health of its residents,” Liane Randolph, the chair of California’s emissions regulating agency, the Air Resources Board, wrote in a statement.\nOld Fight\nIf this all sounds familiar, that’s because the country has sort of been through this before.\nCalifornia’s waiver dates back to 1967, when congressional lawmakers decided to create a special California exemption within national air regulations because the state had such a thorny air pollution problem, and because it had been a pioneer in regulation, creating its own vehicle emissions regulations for more than a decade. Since then, California has applied for more than 100 waivers.\nIn 2019, President Donald Trump announced by tweet that his administration would revoke the California waiver allowing it to set its own auto emissions standards. The move, he said then, would increase auto safety and create “JOBS JOBS JOBS.” But even as the first Trump administration moved to withdraw California’s waiver, state lawmakers struck a deal with four global automakers—Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW—to preserve some auto emissions standards.\nAutomakers were willing to come to the table with California six years ago because they feared a market in which they must make two sets of vehicles—one cleaner fleet for the California-and-its-allies market, and another for the rest of the country.\nThe California market is large enough that even automakers with headquarters far from the US are paying attention to how this shakes out. The state’s aggressive stance towards climate regulation would require automakers lagging on electrification to race to catch up. Toyota, for example, has argued that consumers aren’t ready for battery electrics, and followed a strategy that has seen the automaker churn out more hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Last year, an executive for Toyota Motor North America said the California rules “look impossible.” But keeping those rules in place would require Toyota to invest more in getting electric vehicles on the road.\nThe Biden administration reissued the waiver in 2022. Last year, it approved a new California program allowing the state to, over the course of a decade, ratchet up the share of zero-emission cars sold in the state. Under the rules, 35 percent of model year 2026 cars must be zero-emission; 68 percent of model year 2030 must hit that goal. The state says the rules will, by 2037, reduce light-duty vehicle emissions by a quarter. Automakers will be able to use plug-in hybrid vehicles, not just all-electric ones, to reach their goals.\nThis month, the country’s lead auto lobbyist seemed to praise the Trump administration’s new waiver threat. “There’s a mismatch between current EV market dynamics and the emissions and EV sales targets called for in recent regulations—especially in the states that adopted California’s gas-powered vehicle ban and EV sales requirements,” John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, wrote in a statement. He called the California rules “by any measure not achievable.”\nLegal Tussle\nBecause the feds approved this particular waiver before President Joe Biden left office, revoking California's zero-emission car rules will prove legally tricky for Trump, and cannot be done by fiat. The US Environmental Protection Agency will have to go through a months-long public rulemaking process to nix the waiver. If the federal government goes through with revoking it, experts say, that move will be challenged in court.\nAny effort to get rid of California’s 2035 rules “stands on shaky legal footing,” says Julia Stein, the deputy director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA’s School of Law. For one thing, California’s special waiver ability is explicitly written into the landmark Clean Air Act. And the state needs the vehicle emissions rules to achieve its federal ambient air quality standards. Some 10 million people in the San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles areas live where ozone levels are far above federal rules, and suffer from higher than average rates of asthma and heart disease.\n“Zero-emission vehicles are a critical part of the plan to protect Californians,” the California Air Resources Board says.",

The move, he said then, would increase auto safety and create “JOBS JOBS JOBS.” But even as the first Trump administration moved to withdraw California’s waiver, state lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/californias-auto-emissions-deal-could-trump-feds-plans/\">struck a deal with four global automakers</a>—Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW—to preserve some auto emissions standards.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Automakers were willing to come to the table with California six years ago because they feared a market in which they must make two sets of vehicles—one cleaner fleet for the California-and-its-allies market, and another for the rest of the country.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The California market is large enough that even automakers with headquarters far from the US are paying attention to how this shakes out. The state’s aggressive stance towards climate regulation would require automakers lagging on electrification to race to catch up.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIn the five years since its launch, Bookshop.org has amassed quite the loyal following. The online retailer shares its sales revenue with bookstores around the US, and has become a popular destination for online customers who would rather help keep their local bookstore in business than send money to big retailers like Amazon. Until now, Bookshop has found success through the sale of physical books. Today, Bookshop is expanding its efforts into the digital realm.\nBookshop.org officially sells ebooks now. Or, as the company would put it, Bookshop now enables local bookstores to sell those ebooks themselves through its marketplace. The company launched its official ebook platform today, complete with an app (on Android and iOS) for shopping and reading digital books.\nBookstores can use the platform to sell ebooks directly to customers, and when they make a sale, the store gets all of the money. Customers can also browse all of the ebooks for sale on the website, then choose which bookstore to support with their purchase. In that case as well, the chosen bookstore gets all the money. (If the customer doesn't pick a store to support, Bookshop puts a chunk of the profits into a sharing pool that's distributed among independent stores, but keeps the rest to fund its operation.)\nBookshop CEO Andy Hunter sees a burning need for a better way to buy ebooks.\n“It’s crazy that bookstores can’t sell ebooks to their customers right now,” Hunter says. He says he wants this program to continue his company’s mission of propping up local bookstores, but he also hopes this move will help take Amazon down a peg as well.\n“I know tons of people who love their local bookstore, support them in every other way, but when they need an ebook, they have to go to Amazon to buy that ebook even if they love and support their local bookstore and have ethical concerns about Amazon. We want to change that.”\nBookshop launched in January 2020, mere weeks before the world shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Physical book stores, like many IRL retailers, faced an existential threat when great masses of people shuttered themselves indoors. Many stores had already been struggling against the Goliaths of Amazon, Walmart, and Target well before pandemic restrictions drove more purchases online. Bookshop landed at just the right time to provide something of a crutch for struggling bookstores and offer an alternative to funneling more money into Amazon’s maw.\nIt may not have saved every bookstore or toppled any ecommerce empires, but Bookshop has done quite well—and proven popular among readers eager to support independent stores. At the time of this writing, Bookshop says it has raised more than $35 million for local bookstores.\n“Everybody wants diversity in the landscape,” Hunter says. “Whether you like Amazon or not, everybody understands it’s a healthier market for books when you have a whole bunch of players selling and in competition with each other.”\nThere are some other places to buy ebooks that support independent sellers—a handful of small publishers sell ebooks directly, and the ebook retailer Kobo has an affiliate program that sends a percentage of your ebook purchase to your favorite local bookstore—but Bookshop’s one-stop shop is a unique experience that adds a needed layer of convenience.\nRights and Wrongs\nThe copyright and ownership arguments around ebooks are sticky. Unlike physical books, which you can freely loan out or resell, digital books have more draconian restrictions placed on them by both publishers and marketplaces. Amazon, for instance, has a proprietary ebook file type that can only be opened by a Kindle device, or within the Kindle app. Publishers also tend to hold on to the rights on their ebooks, which limits what customers can do with the titles they purchase.\nCara Gagliano, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who focuses on copyright law, also cautions that ebooks are almost always just licensed to the reader—even when you buy an ebook, you don’t actually own the ebook itself. If something goes wrong with that publisher, or if it decides to pull its ebooks from retailers’ stores, then you run the risk of losing access to the book you bought.\n“The problem with a licensing model is that it gives them the ability to include terms that go beyond copyright law,” Gagliano says. “We've especially been looking into the use of end user license agreements and terms of service to try to expand copyright. So you might also find you’re limited in other ways.”\nIt is these kinds of machinations that Hunter hopes will entice people to use Bookshop instead. The new marketplace is not exactly the anti-Amazon, and there are some caveats. First, many ebooks you can buy on Bookshop are in an e-pub format that cannot be loaded directly onto Amazon’s Kindle devices, which are the most popular e-readers in the world. Second, some books will have digital rights management restrictions that publishers use to limit how a book can be distributed. If the books don’t have DRM, then you can swap that book between devices. If it does have DRM, then you can’t.\nGagliano says the solution to these kinds of problems is only likely to be reached through some kind of legislative action. Hunter knows that won’t happen overnight, but he hopes his new store will push things in the right direction.\n“The first step is to launch the platform,” Hunter says. “Our second step is to make it popular, so we have leverage. And then we can start fixing what we consider to be the industry problems around ebooks.”\nBuying an ebook on Bookshop.org works a little differently than buying a physical book on the platform. Shipping physical books requires storage and labor, so Bookshop takes a cut of the proceeds from sales. For physical books, Bookshop lets buyers direct 30 percent of the proceeds of a sale to their favorite participating bookstore. An additional 10 percent of those sales, plus the sales of books that are not earmarked for a specific store, gets split up and distributed to every store on Bookshop's platform.\nEbook sales through Bookshop, however, will see 100 percent of the proceeds going to the store that sells them through the platform. If a user buys an ebook directly from Bookshop without naming a bookstore they want to support, then a third of that profit will go into the pool of funds that gets divided between stores. The rest will go to pay for Bookshop.org’s engineers and server costs.\nHearts and Minds\nPerhaps the biggest thing Bookshop’s new model is going to have to contend with is what Gagliano describes as “lock in.” Many readers may already have so many books in their Kindle library that it could be hard to just move to a new platform. It’s sort of like the effort of making a switch from a Mac to a PC. The more costs you’ve sunk into a particular ecosystem, the harder it is to pry yourself out.\nHunter gets that, but his hope is that his app is good enough to make the jump—and that people will see the extra value in keeping their local bookshops around. He views it as an important, almost existential step.\n“There’s a future that we’re all getting pulled into where technology and people and governments that don’t have our best interests at heart and don’t have humanity’s best interests at heart and are putting their own agendas ahead of the general good of humanity,” Hunter says.\nHe sees independent bookstores as bastions of community—places in small towns or big cities where people can meet, share culture and knowledge, and make roots. Keeping them in business is good for everyone.\n“It’s motivating, being able to make a difference, even as the ground erodes beneath our feet,” Hunter says. “We’re trying to replenish the topsoil and keep the sustainable systems around the culture of reading and writing strong.”",

    "content_text": "A powerful new open-source artificial intelligence model created by Chinese startup DeepSeek has shaken Silicon Valley over the past few days. Packed with cutting-edge capabilities and developed on a seemingly tiny budget, DeepSeek’s R1 is prompting talk of an impending upheaval in the tech industry.\nTo some people, DeepSeek’s rise signals that the US has lost its edge in AI. But a number of experts, including executives at companies that build and customize some of the world’s most powerful frontier AI models, say it's a sign of a different kind of technological transition underway.\nInstead of trying to create larger and larger models that require increasingly exorbitant amounts of computing resources, AI companies are now focusing more on developing advanced capabilities, like reasoning. That has created an opening for smaller, innovative startups such as DeepSeek that haven’t received billions of dollars in outside investment. “It’s a paradigm shift towards reasoning, and that will be much more democratized,” says Ali Ghodsi, CEO of Databricks, a company that specializes in building and hosting custom AI models.\n“It’s been clear for some time now that innovating and creating greater efficiencies—rather than just throwing unlimited compute at the problem—will spur the next round of technology breakthroughs,” says Nick Frosst, a cofounder of Cohere, a startup that builds frontier AI models. “This is a clarifying moment when people are realizing what's long been obvious.”\nThousands of developers and AI enthusiasts flocked to DeepSeek’s website and its official app in recent days to try out the company’s latest model and shared examples of its sophisticated capabilities on social media. Shares in US tech firms, including the chipmaker Nvidia, fell in response on Monday as investors began to question the vast sums being poured into AI development.\nDeepSeek’s technology was developed by a relatively small research lab in China that sprang out of one of the country’s best-performing quantitative hedge funds. A research paper posted online last December claims that its earlier DeepSeek-V3 large language model cost only $5.6 million to build, a fraction of the amount its competitors needed for similar projects. OpenAI has previously said that some of its models cost upwards of $100 million each. The latest models from OpenAI as well as Google, Anthropic, and Meta likely cost considerably more.\nThe performance and efficiency of DeepSeek’s models has already prompted talk of cost cutting at some big tech firms. One engineer at Meta, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly, says the tech giant will most likely try to examine DeepSeek’s techniques to find ways to reduce its own expenditure on AI. “We believe open source models are driving a significant shift in the industry, and that’s going to bring the benefits of AI to everyone faster,” a spokesperson for Meta said in a statement. “We want the US to continue to be the leader in open source AI, not China, which is why Meta is developing open source AI with our Llama models which have been downloaded over 800 million times.”\nThe true price of developing DeepSeek’s new models remains unknown, however, since one figure quoted in a single research paper may not capture the full picture of its costs. “I don't believe it's $6 million, but even if it's $60 million, it's a game changer,” says Umesh Padval, managing director of Thomvest Ventures, a company that has invested in Cohere and other AI firms. “It will put pressure on the profitability of companies which are focused on consumer AI.”\nShortly after DeepSeek revealed the details of its latest model, Ghodsi of Databricks says customers began asking whether they could use it as well as DeepSeek’s underlying techniques to cut costs at their own organizations. He adds that one approach employed by DeepSeek’s engineers, known as distillation, which involves using the output from one large language model to train another model, is relatively cheap and straightforward.\nPadval says that the existence of models like DeepSeek's will ultimately benefit companies looking to spend less on AI, but he says that many firms may have reservations about relying on a Chinese model for sensitive tasks. So far, at least one prominent AI firm, Perplexity, has publicly announced it's using DeepSeek’s R1 model, but it says it is being hosted “completely independent of China.”\nAmjad Massad, the CEO of Replit, a startup that provides AI coding tools, told WIRED that he thinks DeepSeek’s latest models are impressive. While he still finds Anthropic’s Sonnet model is better at many computer engineering tasks, he has found that R1 is especially good at turning text commands into code that can be executed on a computer. “We’re exploring using it especially for agent reasoning,” he adds.\nDeepSeek’s latest two offerings—DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek R1-Zero—are capable of the same kind of simulated reasoning as the most advanced systems from OpenAI and Google. They all work by breaking problems into constituent parts in order to tackle them more effectively, a process that requires a considerable amount of additional training to ensure that the AI reliably reaches the correct answer.\nA paper posted by DeepSeek researchers last week outlines the approach the company used to create its R1 models, which it claims perform on some benchmarks about as well as OpenAI’s groundbreaking reasoning model known as o1. The tactics DeepSeek used include a more automated method for learning how to problem-solve correctly as well as a strategy for transferring skills from larger models to smaller ones.\nOne of the hottest topics of speculation about DeepSeek is the hardware it might have used. The question is especially noteworthy because the US government has introduced a series of export controls and other trade restrictions over the last few years aimed at limiting China’s ability to acquire and manufacture cutting-edge chips that are needed for building advanced AI.\nIn a research paper from August 2024, DeepSeek indicated that it has access to a cluster of 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, which were placed under US restrictions announced in October 2022. In a separate paper from June of that year, DeepSeek stated that an earlier model it created called DeepSeek-V2 was developed using clusters of Nvidia H800 computer chips, a less capable component developed by Nvidia to comply with US export controls.\nA source at one AI company that trains large AI models, who asked to be anonymous to protect their professional relationships, estimates that DeepSeek likely used around 50,000 Nvidia chips to build its technology.\nNvidia declined to comment directly on which of its chips DeepSeek may have relied on. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement,” a spokesman for Nvidia said in a statement, adding that the startup's reasoning approach “requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking.”\nHowever DeepSeek’s models were built, they appear to show that a less closed approach to developing AI is gaining momentum. In December, Clem Delangue, the CEO of HuggingFace, a platform that hosts artificial intelligence models, predicted that a Chinese company would take the lead in AI because of the speed of innovation happening in open source models, which China has largely embraced. “This went faster than I thought,” he says.",

    "content_text": "Karen Tautges Malinak watches her herd of 20 goats from the kitchen window as she waits for her family to arrive. It’s a clear summer day in Independence, Minnesota—population 3,644, half an hour outside Minneapolis. She holds a pink coffee mug in her hands. “Moms make everything better,” it reads.\nKaren’s life revolves around her farm, which is also the home base for her goat soap business, Rapha Farms. It’s easier for her family to visit her here than it is for her to leave the goats. As we lean against her cluttered kitchen counter, Karen, who is 58, tucks her bobbed silver hair behind an ear and checks the time. “They should be here soon,” she says, her vowels drawn out by her native Minnesota accent. I feel as if I’m in some sort of rural sitcom: I’m due to meet each of Karen’s four daughters, four sons-in-law, and 12 grandchildren over the next two days. Although I’ve spoken to many of them on the phone, I have a strange feeling that almost anyone could walk through the door.\nAdding to the strangeness, Karen and her husband Dave only recently moved to this farm. Because their workshop remains under construction, the soap-making happens wherever there’s space. The living room is filled with racks of finished bars, labeled by scent: tea tree, lilac, lemongrass. Silicon molds cover a long table, and vats of essential oils line the walls. The small kitchen is stacked high with hand blenders; taped to the floor is a sign that says “Poop buckets here.” (One of the joys of working with goats.) There is no room for furniture, hardly space to walk. Where, then, to put the family that will soon arrive?\nAs if on cue, a driveway sensor chimes: Karen’s daughter Michelle, along with her husband and two sons, pulls in. Highlighter shimmers on Michelle’s cheekbones. Her boys, aged 9 and 7, hop out of the car and hand over gifts: a jigsaw puzzle for Dave and a handmade condolence card for Karen. The day before, Karen had to put down Angel, her elderly Maltese.\nKaren pins the card on her refrigerator, beneath a photo of three other grandsons—boys who Michelle, her husband, and her sons have never actually met. That’s because Michelle and her brood aren’t, exactly, Karen’s real family. In fact, none of the people I’m supposed to meet on this visit have any blood relation to Karen. They are families she found online and “adopted” as a surrogate grandmother in the lonely years after her own biological daughters turned her away.\nKaren and Michelle met in November 2023 on a Facebook group called Surrogate Grandparents USA, a place where older and younger Americans connect over a mutual need for family. Many of the posts read like tiny, tragic personal ads:\n“We want grandparents who want to have pizza nights with us, attend baseball and basketball games, have ice cream dates, take bike rides, just genuinely have fun with us and our boys.”\n“My children need more than just me to love them. I can’t be their mama, daddy, aunt, uncle, grandma and grandpa forever! We joke about it, but it’s true and it sits as a pit in my stomach.”\n“One lonely grandma here. I would love to share affection and attention with a nearby family.”\nDonna Skora, a 68-year-old retired paralegal from Summerfield, Florida, created Surrogate Grandparents USA in 2015. “Everybody needs some kind of support system, emotionally,” she tells me. Some members of the group have lost loved ones, while others have never had families of their own. But what the group really represents, Donna says, is a refuge for the estranged. “I realized it was a growing problem, not only in the United States but worldwide.” Scrolling through the messages only confirms this: Many of the posters report being the victims—or initiators—of estrangement.\nToday, around 27 percent of American adults have cut off contact with a family member—one of the highest estrangement rates in the world. And it seems to be on the rise, according to Joshua Coleman, the psychologist and author of the buzzy 2021 book Rules of Estrangement. “Online support groups, Instagram influencers, TikTok influencers,” Coleman says, “all are huge contributors to this phenomenon.” While estrangement has always existed—abuse and divorce are common causes, as are disagreements over money, religion, sexual orientation, and politics—“never before was it characterized as a pathway to personal growth and identity the way it is today,” he says. But just as social media can lead to alienation, it can also bring people together. After all, Coleman runs his own private Facebook group for estranged parents and grandparents.\nI’ll be the first to say it: Facebook? Yes. It might seem lame to younger generations, but Facebook, whose monthly user base comprises a third of the human population, remains a behemoth. It also remains one of the better places online to form and maintain genuine connections. Many of us have been on Facebook for decades, using our real names, checking on our real relatives, posting photos from our real lives, and “friending” our real friends.\nSurrogate Grandparents USA attracted a mere 30 members in its first six months. The group was only as useful as its size—the more members there were, the easier it’d be to find matches. So Donna posted dozens of free ads and contacted local TV stations. By 2019, the group had 3,700 members. Today, it has more than 11,000.\nKaren has two biological daughters. When she divorced their dad in 2019, the eldest, then a college student, cut Karen out of her life. The dad had autism and a brain injury—the older daughter felt Karen had an obligation to him. Karen, meanwhile, felt emotionally abused in the relationship. “She sided with him,” Karen says. Four years later, in 2023, Karen’s younger daughter, with her older sister’s help, left too. The split was a heartbreaking final dissolution, Karen’s family of four whittled to two: Karen and Dave, her second husband. “I stopped sleeping for a month,” Karen says. “It was devastating.”\nBut, soon enough, she figured she needed to move on. “I knew I had gotten through it before,” she says. “I’m not going to live my life being sad, and there are people out there who want relationships with people like me.” That’s when she found Surrogate Grandparents USA.\nKaren lurked on the group for six months before deciding to post a message. “I’d love a mother/daughter relationship, and we are hoping for grandkids,” she wrote. “We have a goat farm … so lots of fun for kids.” The premise didn’t feel so strange to Karen. As a girl, she’d been taken under the wing of her childless next-door neighbors. They took her to a lakeside cabin each summer and bought her presents—a bike, jewelry, glass animals. When they died, Karen inherited the majority of their estate. So why couldn’t something similar happen again? Karen added a selfie to her Facebook post, along with a photo of her and the goats. Ten women responded.\nOne was Michelle. Michelle’s sisters had recommended the group to her—their mother had died six years earlier, and Michelle didn’t have family nearby. She longed for someone to watch her boys’ sports games or take them out to dinner. For a few years, she had watched as Facebook posts flooded in. Nobody was ever located nearby. Until Karen.\nConnecting was, Karen says, “almost like online dating.” They DM’d first, before progressing to texting, calling, and finally arranging to meet up IRL. The group’s moderators encourage people to vet prospective surrogates. Michelle didn’t do that, though she did browse Karen’s social media. It was, needless to say, goat-heavy.\nThey met at a Panera Bread for lunch. Michelle was eager for Karen to like her—the stakes felt high. “I literally had pink eye at the time,” Michelle says, “and I was like, ‘I’m not this ugly, I promise.’” With the holidays on the horizon, they felt the absence of their loved ones. “We both cried at some point,” Michelle says.\nBiological families often have a sense of obligation to spend time together, as well as a lifetime of shared experiences. Not so with surrogate grandparents and their surrogate adult children, who need to become actual friends. Karen and Michelle bonded over their loss and their shared faith as Christians but didn’t involve the boys until they were mutually serious about pursuing the connection. It, indeed, became serious. Karen’s pink coffee mug? A Mother’s Day gift from Michelle.\nAfter introductions, Karen, Michelle, and I suggest moving outside. The kids complain about the bugs that hum up from Karen’s lawn. “I’m not an outside person,” announces the 9-year-old, who wears a shirt with bearded dragons on it. Karen had warned me that these “city kids” are a little less rough-and-tumble than some of her other surrogate grandchildren. I suspect the boys are being dramatic.\nMichelle says that her sisters, who live far away, would also benefit from surrogate grandparents like Karen and Dave, and she hopes they find their own matches. (As she tells me this, I swipe a mosquito off my arm.) Michelle and Dave have connected over their love of Naked and Afraid, and Karen and Dave watch the boys’ soccer games. (I swat a blood sucker from a sliver of bare ankle.) They all celebrated one of the boys’ birthdays recently with a trip to a malt shop, where they split two family-size portions of fries. (I slap a monstrous bug as it lands on my forehead. Listen to the children, I note, for they are wise.) I can tell there’s a real relationship developing between Karen and this family. When we go back inside, Karen hands the brothers a basket of soap samples. “There’s watermelon this time,” she says, and the 7-year-old squeals. That’s the parting ritual, it seems. Michelle and her family say their goodbyes and head out.\nNext up in the rotating door of surrogate families: a woman named MeLea and her three sons. I know, it’s a lot of names to remember. And they all sound sort of similar. Three of Karen’s surrogate daughters have M names: Michelle, MeLea, and Meghan. It’s become a bit of a joke between her and Dave: “You know, it really makes me angry that you named them all starting with the letter M,” he likes to say. Karen maintains a spreadsheet with the ages, birthdays, and interests of a dozen surrogate grandkids ranging in age from 1 to 13.\nMeLea is supposed to meet us at Karen’s house, but she gets busy and asks us to come to her place instead. As we pull up, MeLea’s father-in-law stands outside. He’s there helping the family with some home-improvement tasks. I wonder if this biological grandparent feels weird about encountering a surrogate. He raises a hand. “I’ve been using your soap,” he says to Karen, in a gruff but approving tone, as we make our way inside.\nMeLea’s three boys, ages 2, 4, and 7, are a cyclone of energy, showing off their rock and feather collections, playing nonsense songs on a toy guitar, plucking daisies from the yard to present to us. The youngest appears in the doorway without pants on. MeLea, who wears a tank top that shows off her lanky frame and tattoos, seems unfazed.\nMeLea and Karen swap church gossip over glasses of lemonade. They first met through their congregation: When a mutual friend heard about Karen’s forays into the Facebook group, she encouraged Karen to reach out to MeLea, whose mother had died of lung cancer. Their surrogate process was fairly seamless. MeLea had known Karen’s youngest biological daughter and had prayed for them when the two became estranged.\nAt the kitchen table, the conversation turns to goats and soap. Karen talks wearily about the hundreds of bars she still has to make for upcoming farmers’ markets. MeLea asks how she came up with the company name, Rapha Farms. Karen tells her the word means “healing” in Hebrew—fitting for a soap that could soothe eczema with its lactic acid but also because she started the business for her youngest daughter, who survived childhood brain cancer.\nAs with any family tale, there’s always more to the story. At 8, Karen’s daughter underwent surgery and radiation. When she lost her hair from chemo, Karen shaved her head too. The family adopted Angel the dog to keep her daughter company. Her daughter suffered brain damage from the tumor removal, but the cancer went into remission. Then, at 12, she fell in love with a pair of goats and told her mom that she wanted to be a farmer. Karen was skeptical—goats? Really? They lived in the suburbs of Minnetonka then, but her daughter’s excitement won her over, so they built stalls in their garage for two goats. It was winter, and their hands cramped in the cold as mother and daughter slowly learned how to milk. They fell in love with it. By the next year, they had moved to the country and taken up goat farming full-time. Karen hoped she could teach her daughter how to run the business, imagining she might have limited career opportunities. Karen incorporated goat-tending into a homeschooling plan.\nFor years, Karen’s daughter made soap, helped with the goats, and manned farmers’ market tables. Then she turned 18 and got a boyfriend. She quit her job with Rapha Farms a few days after her 19th birthday and, not long after that, moved out of Karen’s house. She got married in 2023. Karen was not invited. “I honestly don’t understand what happened between us,” Karen wrote in a Rapha Farms Instagram post congratulating the couple. Karen calls this complicated family history her “soap opera.”\nThis year, Karen’s goats had a lot of kids—yes, that’s the technical term—and MeLea asks if she needed to wean them. No, Karen says, the mother goats do that themselves, kicking away their grown-up progeny when they try to nurse. The only exception was Lucy, one of the first two goats she got with her biological daughter, and the mascot for Rapha Farms. “She was the best mom ever,” Karen says. “The other moms would reject their kids, and Lucy would nurse her kids until they didn’t want to nurse anymore.”\nWhen we go to leave, MeLea’s boys groan and ask Karen for hugs. They wave dramatically as they hang from the play structure on the front lawn. I catch my forehead in the reflection of Karen’s rearview mirror—the bug bite has blown up to the exact size and shape of an egg. I’m amazed that the kids didn’t say anything about it. “They’re so sweet,” Karen says once we’re on the road. She seems filled up by the interaction.\nNot everyone sees this situation as Karen does. When MeLea first talked to Karen about becoming a surrogate grandparent, she wanted her sister, Tanya, to be involved too. (That’s not her real name; she spoke to me under the condition that I use a pseudonym.) Tanya was skeptical—and she wasn’t looking for a new mother. The sisters’ mom died only 40 days after being diagnosed with cancer; there had been so little time to process it. “I don’t view Karen as my mom, because my mom’s dead,” Tanya tells me at dinner one night. “MeLea brought it up to me, and I thought she was nuts.” She and her six kids have spent time with Karen, but Tanya feels put off by the situation. “An arranged marriage is how I view it,” she says.\nOf course, even among those who willingly join Surrogate Grandparents USA, there are hazards. One prospective grandma from Missouri told me about four failed surrogate families. She’d been ghosted, hit up for money, and dumped. Another surrogate grandma had a relationship with two girls that got complicated after their parents split. She didn’t agree with all of the parenting choices but didn’t feel like she could say anything. “As a surrogate grandparent, you have no history or relationship with the parents,” she said. “That’s a very unnatural grandparent relationship.” Out of a sense of duty, she continued picking the girls up from school once a week and hosting them for sleepovers at her house, feeling more like nanny than granny.\nThe Facebook group also hasn’t given its founder, Donna, all she’d hoped. When I asked about the founding date of Surrogate Grandparents USA, Donna knew it off the top of her head: The group is the same age as her grandson, whom she has never met. Her son and daughter-in-law cut off contact with Donna’s side of the family when he was born. “We were totally blacked out of their lives completely,” she told me over Zoom from her home in Florida, where she lives with her dog, cats, and husband. Donna gesticulated with her remarkably long nails when she spoke, a stark contrast to her short, white hair and wire-rimmed glasses. Now retired, her days are spent riding electric bikes around her senior living community, kayaking, and moderating Surrogate Grandparents USA. Still, she thinks about her grandson daily. “The pain and the grief is so tremendous,” she said. The Facebook group is a way to commemorate him, though every login is a reminder of her loss.\nDonna created another Facebook group, which is part open letter to her grandson, part chronicle of her experience as an estranged grandparent. She has written to her grandson about how he was a third cousin of Bob Dylan, sent him wishes for a happy Easter. She wrote letters about how his parents were keeping the family apart and attached an image of a $25 check written out to her son, which he had ripped up and returned. The content is incredibly personal, like encountering someone’s diary, but the group is public—how else would her grandson find it someday?\nDonna doesn’t necessarily want to find a surrogate adult child—she has a biological daughter with whom she’s close. What Donna wants is a substitute for the grandson she never met. First, Donna found a family nearby, but she ended things when the parents began asking her for gifts and trips (which has since become a stated no-no in the group’s rules). After that, Donna and her husband connected with a mother and daughter who lived on Long Island. The four met at an amusement park in Orlando and grabbed dinner. For a while after, they talked on the phone and checked in over FaceTime, but the distance became difficult. Donna told me she’d be open to connecting with another surrogate family but wasn’t, at the moment, actively looking.\nDonna often sees people come to the group too fresh from the pain of estrangement or loss. “Some people are going through an emotional time, so they want an overnight fix,” she said. “This is not an overnight fix.”\nTanya’s take is that it would never be a fix. She explains that her sister MeLea is trusting—and, perhaps, has a right to be, considering she knew Karen from real life—but Tanya has questions. She thinks Karen and Dave are “super kind,” she says, but is wary about the other side of the story. “I wish I could sit down with her daughters and be like, ‘What did you see? What did you hear? What was it that broke that relationship for you to the point where you felt like there was no repairing?’” (Karen’s daughters didn’t want to speak with me on the record.) And then there’s the question of what might happen if Karen’s daughters came back into her life. Karen still expresses frustration and sadness about her daughters and keeps up with their whereabouts through mutual friends. When Angel the dog died, Karen texted her youngest daughter the news—but used a new number and posed as a family friend. “With that reaction, I question if the door is really shut,” Tanya says. For her part, Karen considers Tanya part of the surrogate family and seems to be patiently waiting for her to come around.\nAfter dinner, Tanya and I drive separately to her house. I pull up cautiously because her kids—four boys and two girls—are flying down the slanted driveway on bikes and scooters. “Put a helmet on,” Tanya’s husband calls to them from his fold-out chair. All of the kids have pierced ears. “We’re raising the last generation of feral children,” Tanya jokes. We sit in the driveway; they give no invitation to go inside.\n“Why are you getting interviewed?” one of the boys asks his parents.\nI explain that I’m writing a story about how Karen had met lots of different families and—I hesitate. Will Tanya be upset if I used the g-word? Grandma.\nTanya jumps in: “Lexi is doing a piece on families that aren’t related biologically, don’t have the same bloodlines, but they create relationships and stay together long-term, just like if they were biological families.”\n“So what exactly would that mean?” one kid asks.\n“That she would be our grandma,” another kid says in response.\n“No,” Tanya says. “When I say ‘grandma,’ it means something to me. It means something in my heart, like how I feel about my mom. And so I don’t want to put those expectations on it—and, you know, that’s kind of where I want to leave it.”\nThe kids are not ready to leave it. “So by her terms, we would be grandkids?”\n“Maybe,” Tanya says, with some exasperation. “You should ask her.” To Tanya, a biological grandma, bonded by blood and stories, feels truer than whatever Karen can be to them. I wonder if her kids feel the same way. Possibly, they just want a grandma.\nKaren has just finished mixing goat-milk shampoo when Meghan—the fourth surrogate daughter—arrives at the farm with her husband and their 4-year-old son, Owen. Karen wears a shirt that reads “Promoted to Grandma.” Meghan’s light brown hair is pulled back in a tight ponytail. She closes her eyes and takes a deep whiff. “It smells so good in here,” she says.\nOwen, who wears jean shorts and a Minnesota Twins baseball jersey, sticks out his hand to me. It’s cute and earnest, like he’s a tiny businessman. “What’s your name?” he asks, gazing at me with enormous blue eyes. I respond, but he’s off to do something else before I can ask him anything in return. Owen has autism, so his parents have been teaching him appropriate ways to greet people. But, being a kid, his interest shifts quickly.\nAll of us move to Karen’s office upstairs. It’s crowded with supplies and—somehow—more bars of soap, but it has more space than the living room and decidedly fewer bugs than outside. Like Michelle’s sons, Owen also loves the soap. He lights up when Karen offers him samples and places each bar one by one into a paper bag.\nWhen Meghan and Karen met through the Facebook group in late 2023, Karen was in the midst of moving to her farm in Independence. She seemed overwhelmed by the process, so Meghan offered to help her and Dave prep their old home for sale. Meghan’s husband is a contractor and didn’t mind lending a hand too. Karen and Dave took them up on it and paid them for their time. Meghan and her husband even came over to the house while Karen and Dave were off on vacation and painted the whole basement.\nDespite the way she dove headlong into Karen’s life (and home), Meghan had been careful about selecting a surrogate grandparent online. She and her husband have battled substance abuse and were still adjusting to their sober lives. “Since we got clean and moved, we don’t hang out with anybody,” she says. “We’re very particular on who we let into our lives. They were pretty much the first outsiders we’ve hung out with.”\nWhen Meghan got pregnant with Owen, she was still using. “When I gave birth, we took him home to a homeless shelter because we had nowhere to go,” she says. Her biological mother didn’t offer help or a place to stay. It was the end of that relationship. “After going through what I’ve gone through, I know that estrangement can come in many, many forms,” she says, which is why she wasn’t worried when she learned about Karen’s biological daughters. She and Karen bonded over their interest in holistic health and natural living, which has been a focus for Meghan since getting sober. Because Karen’s ex-husband had autism, she also had some insights into Meghan’s experiences.\nMeghan and her husband got married at City Hall in the spring; Karen and Dave were their witnesses. Meghan insisted it be a quick, informal affair, but Karen still made her a bouquet with red and white roses. I imagined Karen by Meghan’s side—there for Meghan even though she hadn’t been invited to her own daughters’ weddings.\nBack in Karen’s office, 4-year-old Owen asks me an important question: “Do you have pepperoni?” I do not. But Karen does. Owen grabs her by the hand to lead her to the kitchen. He leads her out of the room at other times too, so she can show him where to get a power strip to plug into an electrical outlet (he loves outlets), or because he wants to check out her vacuum, or because he wants her to help him find Dave. He seems as comfortable with her as any grandchild would be with a grandparent.\nPretty soon, Karen, Meghan, Owen, and I head outside. Bugs be damned, I’m eager to meet the goats. Dave joins us as we feed them mushy bananas out of soap molds, then he takes me inside the goat pen. Owen follows us at first but gets overwhelmed when the goats surround him. I can’t blame him: The biggest goat, Buddy, weighs 230 pounds.\nDave tells me how, two years ago, Lucy—their goat mascot and “best mom ever”—got pneumonia. Parasites took advantage of her weakened immune system, and she died. Karen and Dave were devastated to lose one of their original goats. Then something strange happened. Lucy had been the herd’s queen. The other goats relied on her to know when it was time to feed, what path to take through the pasture, when they should go into heat for breeding. After she died, the goats stood out screaming in the field as night fell. No one had told them how to get home. Without their mother, they were lost. All this time later, a queen hasn’t stepped up to take Lucy’s place. As we talk, a doe rams into a boy goat that has a swath of my linen pant leg in its mouth. That doe seems to be coming into her own, I note. “Maybe she’ll be the new queen,” Dave says. Only time will tell if she has what it takes, and if the herd will accept her as their new mother.\nSeveral weeks after my trip to Minnesota, Karen calls to say that she’s in touch with her youngest daughter again. Her daughter’s brain cancer has returned. Karen’s voice shakes; patients with this diagnosis tend to live five years, maybe less. She wants to help her daughter through treatment, but her daughter has only agreed to communicate by phone.\nKaren’s surrogate children and grandchildren tried to be there for her. Michelle brought her coffee at the farmer’s market. MeLea and Tanya took her to the county fair with the kids. They felt Karen’s pain. But this raised old questions: Would they lose their new relationship if Karen’s “real” daughters reconnected?\nWhen Karen got the news of the diagnosis, she hired more workers for the farm so she could drop everything for her daughter. She waited for a call that never came; her daughter stopped responding. As months passed without her daughter asking for help, Karen was left with an open calendar. “I guess that will free up more time for the grandkids,” she tells me, forcing brightness into her tone.\nThat ends up being true for some of her surrogate families, but not for others. By the fall, Karen drifts apart from Meghan. Though Meghan seems to want a real connection, Karen tells me that her husband “drops lots of hints about wanting handouts, and that was getting old.” Meanwhile, MeLea and Tanya argue regularly—in the way sisters do, about the kind of family wounds that go back lifetimes. They go for stretches without speaking to each other. “They both have called me crying,” Karen says. “MeLea says her mom would’ve fixed it.” And Karen wants to; she’s trying.\nAt Thanksgiving, about a year after she first posted about herself in Surrogate Grandparents USA, Karen posts a different kind of photo, this one to the Rapha Farms feed. In it, she gathers around a banquet table with MeLea’s and Michelle’s families. The adults had met before, but this is the first time the kids have gotten together. Everyone is dressed comfortably in sweatshirts and jeans. MeLea’s youngest son splays half asleep in his father’s arms, Michelle’s eldest son smiles and poses with his arm around Karen. They look like a family.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

    "content_text": "The DeepSeek AI chatbot, released by a Chinese startup, has temporarily dethroned OpenAI’s ChatGPT from the top spot on Apple’s US App Store.\nThe app is completely free to use, and DeepSeek’s R1 model is powerful enough to be comparable to OpenAI’s o1 “reasoning” model, except DeepSeek’s chatbot is not sequestered behind a $20-a-month paywall like OpenAI’s is. Also, the DeepSeek model was efficiently trained using less powerful AI chips, making it a benchmark of innovative engineering.\nI’ve tested many new generative AI tools over the past couple of years, so I was curious to see how DeepSeek compares to the ChatGPT app already on my smartphone. After a few hours of using it, my initial impressions are that DeepSeek’s R1 model will be a major disruptor for US-based AI companies, but it still suffers from the weaknesses common to other generative AI tools, like rampant hallucinations, invasive moderation, and questionably scraped material.\nHow to Access the DeepSeek Chatbot\nUsers interested in trying out DeepSeek can access the R1 model through the Chinese startup’s smartphone apps (Android, Apple), as well as on the company’s desktop website. You can also use the model through third-party services like Perplexity Pro. In the app or on the website, click on the DeepThink (R1) button to use the best model. Developers who want to experiment with the API can check out that platform online. It’s also possible to download a DeepSeek model to run locally on your computer.\nIn order to use all the consumer features, you will need to create a user account that tracks your chats. “We store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People's Republic of China,” reads the company’s privacy policy. Check out this article from WIRED’s Security desk for a more detailed breakdown about what DeepSeek does with the data it collects. It’s worth keeping in mind that, just like ChatGPT and other American chatbots, you should always avoid sharing highly personal details or sensitive information during your interactions with a generative AI tool.\nIs This Basically FreeGPT?\nYes and no! If you’re looking for a free chatbot to use, ChatGPT already includes plenty of free features. So does Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and Meta’s AI tool. So, why is the fact that DeepSeek is free notable? It’s about the raw power of the model that’s generating these free-for-now answers. As previously mentioned, DeepSeek’s R1 mimics OpenAI’s latest o1 model, without the $20-a-month subscription fee for the basic version and $200-a-month for the most capable model. This comes as a major blow to OpenAI’s attempt to monetize ChatGPT through subscriptions.\nAnother feature that’s similar to ChatGPT is the option to send the chatbot out into the web to gather links that inform its answers. DeepSeek does not have deals with publishers to use their content in answers; OpenAI does , including with WIRED’s parent company, Condé Nast. But the web search outputs were decent, and the links gathered by the bot were generally helpful.\nStill, the current DeepSeek app does not have all the tools longtime ChatGPT users may be accustomed to, like the memory feature that recalls details from past conversations so you’re not always repeating yourself. DeepSeek also doesn’t have anything close to ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, which lets you have voice conversations with the chatbot, though the startup is working on more multimodal capabilities.\nA Research Breakthrough, but Still Inaccurate\nThough it may almost seem unfair to knock the DeepSeek chatbot for issues common across AI startups, it’s worth dwelling on how a breakthrough in model training efficiency does not even come close to solving the roadblock of hallucinations, where a chatbot just makes things up in its responses to prompts. Many of the outputs I generated included blatant falsehoods, confidently spewed out. For example, when I asked R1 what the model already knew about me without searching the web, the bot was convinced I’m a longtime tech reporter at The Verge. No shade, but not true!\nAs other reporters have demonstrated, the app often begins generating answers about topics that are censored in China, like the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, before deleting the output and encouraging you to ask about other topics, like math. With that in mind, I retried a few of the tests I used in 2023, after ChatGPT’s web browsing had just launched, and actually got helpful answers about culturally sensitive topics. I pretended to be a woman looking for a late-term abortion in Alabama, and DeepSeek provided useful advice about traveling out of state, even listing specific clinics worth researching and highlighting organizations that provide travel assistance funds.\nSure, DeepSeek has earned praise in Silicon Valley for making the model available locally with open weights—the ability for the user to adjust the model’s capabilities to better fit specific uses. Even so, the model remains just as opaque as all the other options when it comes to what data the startup used for training, and it’s clear a massive amount of data was needed to pull this off. Without the web search enabled, I was able to generate full snippets of classic WIRED articles. Does this mean the articles were ingested as part of the training process? It’s hard to be certain, and DeepSeek doesn’t have a communications team or a press representative yet, so we may not know for a while.\nDeclaring DeepSeek’s R1 release as a death blow to American AI leadership would be both premature and hyperbolic. While the success of DeepSeek does call into question the real need for high-powered chips and shiny new data centers, I wouldn’t be surprised if companies like OpenAI borrowed ideas from DeepSeek’s architecture to improve their own models. Rather than fully popping the AI bubble, this high-powered free model will likely transform how we think about AI tools—much like how ChatGPT’s original release defined the shape of the current AI industry.",

    "content_text": "Since January 7, wildfires have been burning their way through Los Angeles. The aftermath is devastating, with over 16,000 homes destroyed, drinking water contaminated, and more than two dozen people killed. As longtime residents attempt to rebuild, relief has come in all forms, from donations made to the American Red Cross to people giving to individual families’ GoFundMe efforts. Soon, those looking to help will have a new way to give: by buying a video game bundle.\nThe California Fire Relief Bundle is the work of indie studio Necrosoft Games and a collection of volunteers the company’s director, Brandon Sheffield, organized to compile the bundle. From January 12 through 19, they collected 422 games—including popular titles like Tunic, Octodad: Dadliest Catch, and Hoa—on independent game platform Itch.io. From those, Sheffield says, the collective aims to create the California Fire Relief Bundle, which it’ll sell for about $10 a pop, a good price for hundreds of titles. Proceeds from the bundle, which Sheffield aims to launch “ASAP,” will go to relief efforts aimed at helping Los Angeles-area residents get back on their feet financially.\n“I've seen many [people] get priced out because it can be an expensive place to live,” says Sheffield, a California native. “So when a fire like this reduces total housing, inspires landlords to do price hikes, and gets unhoused folks into even more vulnerable positions, it feels like those of us in stable living positions should do whatever we can.”\nLos Angeles holds a special place in the heart of the video game industry. It’s home to hundreds of developers and to studios such as Riot Games, Naughty Dog, and Santa Monica Studio. Before E3 shut down, downtown LA was the conference’s longtime home. It’s the location of The Game Awards and the venue for many smaller annual game events. It’s in part because of that association, Sheffield says, that developers from everywhere are stepping in to help.\nBut there’s another reason: climate change. A warming world is increasing the likelihood of wildfires in California. The same is true of hurricanes and other natural disasters. For video game developers, whose work has its own substantial carbon footprint, these environmental impacts are “a big deal for everyone,” Sheffield says.\n“This crisis has deeply affected our teams, with some Rioters losing their homes and many others still evacuated,” Riot wrote in a statement about the fires. The game company also announced its own in-game fundraisers to be held within Valorant and League of Legends. Other video game companies such as Activision and Sony are also donating to relief efforts.\nAccording to a recent report from the organizers of the Game Developers Conference, 16 percent of devs surveyed said they’d been impacted by natural disasters in the past year. Seventy-three percent of respondents to the “State of the Game Industry” report, for which organizers surveyed over 3,000 people, specified that they were impacted by water-related incidents, including hurricanes, floods, and storms. “Hurricane Milton did some damage at my home office, causing me lots of unexpected financial hardship,” wrote one developer in Florida. “I'm no longer able to pour money into my business as much as I did before.”\nOther developers in tropical regions pointed to intense flooding that kept them stranded, or worse. “Four people in our team were affected by the flood [in the] south of Brazil in May 2024,” a developer wrote. “One of our colleagues had to seek shelter and couldn’t work for three weeks.”\nSheffield’s own team was also hit hard, and not just by the LA fires. “This year alone, with my small team of eight, we've seen people having to shelter or evacuate from storms, tornados, hurricanes, and wildfires,” Sheffield says. “One of our artist's parents had to evacuate for this fire event specifically.”\nVideo games, like many organizations in the tech world, play a part in the ongoing climate crisis, from the electricity they use to the environmental issues that arise in their production. Developers are well aware of this. In the past few years, some have made games specifically to help raise awareness; major companies like Epic Games and Microsoft implemented energy-saving features into their games and platforms, respectively.\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence—an unpopular move already among many developers—is doing increasingly more damage as the use of AI balloons. AI also requires a huge amount of energy, which tech companies are currently scrambling to suck up. “Not only is AI contributing to climate change through emissions, they're driving up energy prices,” says Sheffield, whose LA fires fundraising bundle specifically rejected games that used generative AI. “A lot of game developers are complicit in this right now and should maybe give that a real thought.”",

    "content_text": "The United States’ recent regulatory action against the Chinese-owned social video platform TikTok prompted mass migration to another Chinese app, the social platform “Rednote.” Now, a generative artificial intelligence platform from the Chinese developer DeepSeek is exploding in popularity, posing a potential threat to US AI dominance and offering the latest evidence that moratoriums like the TikTok ban will not stop Americans from using Chinese-owned digital services.\nDeepSeek, an AI research lab created by a prominent Chinese hedge fund, recently gained popularity after releasing its latest open source generative AI model that easily competes with top US platforms like those developed by OpenAI. However, to help avoid US sanctions on hardware and software, DeepSeek created some clever workarounds when building its models. On Monday, DeepSeek’s creators limited new sign-ups after claiming the app had been overrun with a “large-scale malicious attack.”\nWhile DeepSeek has several AI models, some of which can be downloaded and run locally on your laptop, the majority of people will likely access the service through its iOS or Android apps or its web chat interface. Like with other generative AI models, you can ask it questions and get answers; it can search the web; or it can alternatively use a reasoning model to elaborate on answers.\nDeepSeek, which does not appear to have established a communications department or press contact yet, did not return a request for comment from WIRED about its user data protections and the extent to which it prioritizes data privacy initiatives.\nAs people clamor to test out the AI platform, though, the demand brings into focus how the Chinese startup collects user data and sends it home. Users have already reported several examples of DeepSeek censoring content that is critical of China or its policies. The AI setup appears to collect a lot of information—including all your chat messages—and send it back to China. In many ways, it’s likely sending more data back to China than TikTok has in recent years, since the social media company moved to US cloud hosting to try to deflect US security concerns\n“It shouldn’t take a panic over Chinese AI to remind people that most companies in the business set the terms for how they use your private data” says John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. “And that when you use their services, you’re doing work for them, not the other way around.”\nWhat DeepSeek Collects About You\nTo be clear, DeepSeek is sending your data to China. The English-language DeepSeek privacy policy, which lays out how the company handles user data, is unequivocal: “We store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.”\nIn other words, all the conversations and questions you send to DeepSeek, along with the answers that it generates, are being sent to China or can be. DeepSeek’s privacy policies also outline the information it collects about you, which falls into three sweeping categories: information that you share with DeepSeek, information that it automatically collects, and information that it can get from other sources.\nThe first of these areas includes “user input,” a broad category likely to cover your chats with DeepSeek via its app or website. “We may collect your text or audio input, prompt, uploaded files, feedback, chat history, or other content that you provide to our model and Services,” the privacy policy states. Within DeepSeek’s settings, it is possible to delete your chat history. On mobile, go to the left-hand navigation bar, tap your account name at the bottom of the menu to open settings, and then click “Delete all chats.”\nThis collection is similar to that of other generative AI platforms that take in user prompts to answer questions. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, has been criticized for its data collection although the company has increased the ways data can be deleted over time. Regardless of these types of protections, privacy advocates emphasize that you should not disclose any sensitive or personal information to AI chat bots.\n“I would not input personal or private data in any such an AI assistant,” says Lukasz Olejnik, independent researcher and consultant, affiliated with King's College London Institute for AI. Olejnik notes, though, that if you install models like DeepSeek’s locally and run them on your computer, you can interact with them privately without your data going to the company that made them. Additionally, AI search company Perplexity says it has added DeepSeek to its platforms but claims it is hosting the model in US and EU data centers.\nOther personal information that goes to DeepSeek includes data that you use to set up your account, including your email address, phone number, date of birth, username, and more. Likewise, if you get in touch with the company, you’ll be sharing information with it.\nBart Willemsen, a VP analyst focusing on international privacy at Gartner, says that, generally, the construction and operations of generative AI models is not transparent to consumers and other groups. People don’t know exactly how they work or the exact data they have been built upon. For individuals, DeepSeek is largely free, although it has costs for developers using its APIs. “So what do we pay with? What do we usually pay with: data, knowledge, content, information,” Willemsen says.\nAs with all digital platforms—from websites to apps—there can also be a large amount of data that is collected automatically and silently when you use the services. DeepSeek says it will collect information about what device you are using, your operating system, IP address, and information such as crash reports. It can also record your “keystroke patterns or rhythms,” a type of data more widely collected in software built for character-based languages. Additionally, if you purchase DeepSeek’s premium services, the platform will collect that information. It also uses cookies and other tracking technology to “measure and analyze how you use our services.”\nA WIRED review of the DeepSeek website's underlying activity shows the company also appears to send data to Baidu Tongji, Chinese tech giant Baidu's popular web analytics tool, as well as Volces, a Chinese cloud infrastructure firm. In a social media post, Sean O'Brien, founder of Yale Law School's Privacy Lab, said that DeepSeek is also sending “basic” network data and “device profile” to TikTok owner ByteDance “and its intermediaries.\nThe final category of information DeepSeek reserves the right to collect is data from other sources. If you create a DeepSeek account using Google or Apple sign-on, for instance, it will receive some information from those companies. Advertisers also share information with DeepSeek, its policies say, and this can include “mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which we use to help match you and your actions outside of the service.”\nHow DeepSeek Uses Information\nHuge volumes of data may flow to China from DeepSeek’s international user base, but the company still has power over how it uses the information. DeepSeek’s privacy policy says the company will use data in many typical ways, including keeping its service running, enforcing its terms and conditions, and making improvements.\nCrucially, though, the company’s privacy policy suggests that it may harness user prompts in developing new models. The company will “review, improve, and develop the service, including by monitoring interactions and usage across your devices, analyzing how people are using it, and by training and improving our technology,” its policies say.\nDeepSeek’s privacy policy also says the company will also use information to “comply with [its] legal obligations”—a blanket clause many companies include in their policies. DeepSeek’s privacy policy says data can be accessed by its “corporate group,” and it will share information with law enforcement agencies, public authorities, and more when it is required to do so.\nWhile all companies have legal obligations, those based in China do have notable responsibilities. Over the past decade, Chinese officials have passed a series of cybersecurity and privacy laws meant to allow state officials to demand data from tech companies. One 2017 law, for instance, says that organizations and citizens should “cooperate with national intelligence efforts.”\nThese laws, alongside growing trade tensions between the US and China and other geopolitical factors, fueled security fears about TikTok. The app could harvest huge amounts of data and send it back to China, those in favor of the TikTok ban argued, and the app could also be used to push Chinese propaganda. (TikTok has denied sending US user data to China’s government.) Meanwhile, several DeepSeek users have already pointed out that the platform does not provide answers for questions about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and it answers some questions in ways that sound like propaganda.\nWillemsen says that, compared to users on a social media platform like TikTok, people messaging with a generative AI system are more actively engaged and the content can feel more personal. In short, any influence could be larger. “Risks of subliminal content alteration, conversation direction steering, in active engagement ought by that logic to lead to more concern, not less,” he says, “especially given how the inner workings of the model are widely unknown, its thresholds, borders, controls, censorship rules, and intent/personae largely left unscrutinized, and it being already so popular in its infancy stage.”\nOlejnik, of King's College London, says that while the TikTok ban was a specific situation, US law makers or those in other countries could act again on a similar premise. “We can’t rule out that 2025 will bring an expansion: direct action against AI firms,” Olejnik says. “Of course, data collection may again be named as the reason.”\nUpdated 5:27 pm EST, January 27, 2025: Added additional details about the DeepSeek website's activity.\nUpdated 10:05 am EST, January 29, 2025: Added additional details about DeepSeek's network activity.",

The suite of artificial intelligence features—introduced late in 2024 in iOS 18.1—has received mixed reactions. Some capabilities, like automatically transcribing voice notes and recordings, creating custom emojis, and proofreading, are handy. Others not so much. Apple came under fire for inaccurate notification summaries, particularly those from news apps, and it has temporarily disabled the feature for news and entertainment apps in iOS 18.3.\nWhen Apple first launched its AI venture, you had to opt in. But now, with iOS 18.3, which just released today, Apple Intelligence is enabled automatically during the onboarding process for new users, and anyone upgrading to iOS 18.3. You can still opt out by following a few steps. Whether you want to enable just certain features or disable the whole thing, here's how to turn off Apple Intelligence.\nFor more on Apple Intelligence (and other features), check out our iOS 18 roundup and macOS Sequoia roundup. Also, check out our other Apple guides, including the Best iPhones, Best iPads, and Best MacBooks.\nWhat's Powered by Apple Intelligence?\nFor a breakdown of Apple Intelligence and how each feature works, read our aforementioned roundup of iOS 18 features and macOS 15 features. Below is a list of all the capabilities you'll have access to when it's enabled:\n- Writing Tools\n- ChatGPT Extension via Siri\n- Genmoji\n- Image Playground\n- Image Wand\n- Priority Notifications\n- Summaries in Mail and Messages\n- Notification Summaries\n- Reduce Interruptions Focus\nRemember, Apple Intelligence is only available on select devices. For example, even if older iPhones can download iOS 18, only handsets like the iPhone 15 Pro and the entire iPhone 16 range support Apple's AI capabilities.\nHow to Disable Apple Intelligence\nDisabling Apple Intelligence is the same process whether you're using an iPhone, iPad, or Mac:\n- Open Settings on your device\n- Scroll down until you find Apple Intelligence & Siri and tap on it\n- Toggle Apple Intelligence off\nHow to Disable Specific Features\nYou don't have to turn off Apple Intelligence completely. You can disable the ChatGPT integration or even turn it off within apps, preventing Siri from making suggestions across all your apps.\n- Go to Settings > Apple Intelligence\n- Scroll down to Apps\n- Select the app you want to disable Apple Intelligence from, tap on it, and toggle off “Learn from this App”\nIn the Mail app, you can also turn off the email summarization feature (which is part of Apple Intelligence). That way, it will no longer summarize previews of your emails as you scroll through your inbox.\n- Go to Settings > Apps\n- Tap the Mail app\n- Scroll down to Message List\n- Toggle off Summarize Message Preview\nApple has made it easier to distinguish AI-summarized notifications. They'll now appear in italics, and you can press and hold the notification and tap Options to turn them off more quickly without diving into a settings menu.\nYou can also turn off the ChatGPT extension, which will keep Siri and other features from using OpenAI's chatbot to help answer questions.\n- Go to Settings > Apple Intelligence\n- Scroll down to ChatGPT and select it\n- Toggle Use ChatGPT off\nTurn Apple Intelligence Back On\nIf you change your mind, you can always turn Apple Intelligence back on. Follow the same steps you took to turn it off.\n- Open Settings\n- Scroll down and select Apple Intelligence & Siri\n- Toggle Apple Intelligence & Siri on\nThis enables the feature immediately, though you may have to give your device some time for all the features to load. You can see the loading progress on your screen in real time.",

    "content_text": "For at least 100 years, automakers have stuck to a tried and trusted playbook: They’ll kick, scream, and obfuscate before they’re forced by law to fit profit-draining, life-saving technology. From their successful rejection of speed governor proposals in the 1920s, to their shaming by lawyer Ralph Nader’s Unsafe at Any Speed published in 1965, which inspired the creation of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the US, auto companies—Volvo excepted—have rarely incorporated safety features willingly.\nTrue to form, a lawsuit filed January 17 by the auto industry’s leading lobbying group seeks to repeal a safety rule that would make automated emergency braking standard equipment in all cars—something that NHTSA estimates will save at least 362 lives every year, but which road safety groups expect will save many more, perhaps even tens of thousands more.\nThe auto industry claims the rule will be almost impossible to implement. Road safety experts say this is patently false, and accuse car companies of balking at the cost of fitting upgraded braking kit as standard, despite the lifesaving potential.\nAccording to an OECD report released on the last day of December, Americans are far more likely to die in car crashes than those living in other rich countries. The per capita crash death rate is three times higher in the US than Ireland, Norway, UK, Germany, or Japan. Only those living in Costa Rica and Colombia fare worse.\nThe new US rule isn’t a diktat from a nannying European Union; it’s a homegrown one and, unusually, is even tougher to meet than a similar EU law in force across Europe since 2022. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 127—FMVSS 127 for short, introduced last July—gives automakers four years to fit all cars and light trucks with advanced, always-on automatic emergency braking (AEB) technology that, in a “crash imminent situation,” states the regulation, will “automatically apply the vehicle brakes if the driver has not done so.”\nLow-speed AEB—marketed as Eyesight by Subaru and Pre-Collision Assist with Automatic Emergency Braking by Ford—has been around since the mid-1990s, but FMVSS 127 stipulates that the technology should work at higher speeds, and in darkness, and should not be an optional add-on but fitted as standard.\nNHTSA began testing AEB systems as part of the government’s five-star safety rating program known as the New Car Assessment Program, or NCAP, in 2010, and soon thereafter listed them as “recommended advanced technology” but did not mandate their fitting.\nNow, the systems “have reached a level of maturity to make a significant contribution to reducing the frequency and severity of crashes and are thus ready to be mandated,” says a NHTSA notice on the Federal Register.\nMandating advanced AEB systems would “address a clear and growing safety problem,” states NHTSA, asserting that “to wait for market-driven adoption … would lead to deaths and injuries that could be avoided if the technology were required.”\nNHTSA estimates that equipping new cars and trucks with advanced AEB will cost the auto industry $354 million. Automakers say it will be more than that, and they make no secret that one of their core objections to FMVSS 127 is that it will cut into their profits.\nThe Washington, DC–based Alliance for Automotive Innovation told NHTSA that the “proposed phase-in schedule may require redesigns outside of the normal product development cycle” and that this “would significantly increase costs.”\nThe Biden administration stipulation—mostly achievable with software tweaks, not hardware upgrades—was labeled as “flawed” by the Alliance, which filed suit in the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. In addition to the lawsuit, the trade association and lobby group—which represents Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Toyota, and others—also wrote to President Trump urging him to “re-open the AEB rule.”\nSafety groups are hoping Trump will ignore the Alliance’s pleas. FMVSS 127 is the “most impactful regulation for roadway safety issued in years,” says Cathy Chase, president of DC-based Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. On a video call she tells WIRED: “The auto industry does not like regulation. From airbags to electronic stability control, to pretty much every safety regulation that you can think of, the auto industry in one way or another did not want it.”\n“We lose 42,800 people a year to traffic violence [in the US],” says Peter Norton, associate professor of history in the Department of Engineering and Society at the University of Virginia. “This is due in part to our habit of asking [automotive companies] for [their] permission in matters of public safety.”\n“We didn’t ask theater owners for permission to require fire exits,” he says. “Government ordered theatre owners to install fire exits; horrific death tolls fell. If a theater owner said ‘Installing a fire exit is too expensive,’ government replied ‘Then we’ll make failure to install a fire exit even more expensive for you.’”\n“This principle applies with equal validity to automobile brakes,” says Norton. “We can ask industry how we can make implementation less burdensome, but we must not ask them whether the regulation is necessary—industry’s private interests and our public interests are different.”\nUnder FMVSS 127, cars and light trucks will be required to be able to “stop and avoid contact” with other motor vehicles at speeds of up to 62 mph. AEB systems must also apply the brakes automatically “up to 90 mph when a collision with a lead vehicle is imminent, and up to 45 mph when a pedestrian is detected.” Vehicle sensors must also detect pedestrians in both daylight and darkness.\nIn a letter to Congress in June last year, Alliance president and CEO John Bozzella claimed that meeting FMVSS 127 would be “practically impossible with available technology.”\nHowever, a close read of several brands' owner manuals suggests otherwise. The 2022 Toyota Prius Prime manual states that its system’s maximum AEB activation speed is 112 mph; ditto for the 2022 Lexus NX 250. The 2023 Hyundai Palisade owner’s manual lists the maximum AEB activation speed as 124.27 mph. Similarly, owner’s manuals from Volvo, Tesla, and other companies show that high-speed AEB activation has been on the market for years.\n“[FMVSS 127’s] requirements are achievable,” Joe Young, the media director of the insurance-industry-backed Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tells WIRED, “especially given the lengthy time frame that NHSTA has given the automakers.”\nThe AAA’s director of automotive research, Greg Brannon, agrees, stating that the new standard is “very challenging … but it is possible.”\n“We’ve been testing automatic emergency braking systems for well over a decade, and FMVSS 127 is definitely a jump, but the important thing to note about many of the higher-speed scenarios is that the standard only requires fully automatic emergency braking up to 50 miles an hour,” says Brannon. Speeds higher than this will include dynamic brake support, which sees the driver initiating the braking sequence. “The AEB system at those higher speeds doesn’t have to guess whether or not it should be braking,” he says.\nThe most challenging part of FMVSS 127 is the night-time Pedestrian Automatic Emergency Braking (PAEB) test, which, unlike the EU’s new AEB regulation, needs to work in complete darkness. More than 70 percent of pedestrians hit and killed by motorists are struck at night, according to NHTSA.\nProtecting pedestrians at night is “likely to require further advancements and developments in sensor technologies,” states Nadine Wong, director of track testing at independent testing company Dynamic Research. Working from a test track 15 miles north of Bakersfield, California, Dynamic Research already conducts FMVSS 127 testing for clients. “We know that there are vehicles currently available that already come close to achieving the standard,” said Wong.\nNHTSA acknowledges that FMVSS 127 is “technology-forcing,” but emphasizes that the “standard is practicable.”\nWhile the industry would be on the hook for $354 million in mostly software development costs, US society would benefit to the tune of up to $7.26 billion, says NHSTA, citing reductions in costs for the “negative externalities” of serious car crashes such as emergency service call-outs, medical care, insurance administrative costs, workplace costs, and legal costs.\n“Considering that automaking is America’s largest manufacturing sector, employs 10 million Americans, generates 5 percent of the US GDP, and drives $1 trillion into the economy annually,” says Chase, “it is remarkable that [the auto industry] would be unable to meet the requirements in the AEB rule by September 2029.”\nIn a press statement, William Wallace, Consumer Report’s director of safety advocacy, agreed: “It is profoundly disappointing that automakers are suing to block this lifesaving automatic emergency braking rule.”\nShaun Kildare, research director at the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, concurs. “When they say, ‘It's impracticable, we can never meet this standard,’ it’s false because some auto companies are already selling vehicles in the US that do it,” he says, “and they're definitely selling vehicles abroad that do it. [Auto companies] just don’t want to pay for it on every vehicle.”\nStill, the Alliance’s Bozzella has called FMVSS 127 a “disastrous” rule that “will endlessly—and unnecessarily—frustrate drivers [and] make vehicles more expensive.” Somewhat strangely, Bozzella also claims that the more stringent standard, tougher even than the equivalent one in EU, “won’t really improve driver or pedestrian safety.”\nHowever, the Alliance’s lawsuit ought to fail, says Chase. “NHTSA is risk averse. They like everything buttoned up. They would not have put out this rule if they thought it could be easily challenged.”\nLate last year, NHTSA released a set of studies showing that more than 860,000 lives have been saved by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards since 1968. Frontal air bags alone have saved more than 50,000 lives over a 30-year period, estimates NHTSA.\nPresident Trump nominated Sean Duffy to be the secretary of transportation, and he was duly confirmed on January 22. Duffy had told members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation that road safety was “close to home” for him, explaining that his wife survived a head-on car crash. He vowed to prioritize road safety, including for pedestrians and bicyclists.\nTrump also nominated Steven Bradbury to be deputy secretary of transportation. Bradbury is a fellow at right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, which wrote Project 2025, a 900-plus-page blueprint for government. Trump disavowed this plan during the election, but an analysis by Time.com has found that nearly two-thirds of the executive actions Trump has issued so far mirror or partially mirror proposals from Project 2025, including sweeping deregulation.\nProject 2025’s transportation plans include reducing fuel economy standards and removing highway spending from pedestrian and bicycling projects. Project 2025 was also in favor of smaller government and fewer regulations, an ask likely to be supercharged by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\nOn January 24, NHTSA said it would delay the effective date of FMVSS 127 to March 20 to give the new Trump administration time to further review the regulation.\nIt’s unknown whether Trump—or DOGE—will eventually kill FMVSS 127, but, says Norton, author also of a book on autonomous driving, “if we can’t get automakers to accept vehicle automation for safety, then we can’t expect them to be serious about fully robotic cars.”",

    "content_text": "When online romance and sextortion scammers sense they’ve found a victim who may send them money, they’ll use all kinds of villainous methods to get paid. They’ll frequently stoop to blackmail—and are constantly creating more devious approaches to incorporate it into their grifts. In recent months, cybercriminals have taken their blackmailing efforts up a notch, creating realistic-looking “news” videos that claim their victims are wanted for crimes.\nScammers based in West Africa, likely in Nigeria, and going under the broad umbrella of the Yahoo Boys, have increasingly been seen sending blackmail victims videos likely using AI-generated news anchors in a bid to pressure victims into paying up. A WIRED review of posts on Telegram by self-styled Yahoo Boys shows the cybercriminals are impersonating television stations based in the US and sharing tutorials about how to create the blackmailing videos.\nThe videos follow a sinister pattern. One video—which can be seen in the image below—uses CNN’s logo and branding to impersonate the news organization, with text at the bottom of the screen describing the “breaking news.” On the screen, a likely AI-generated newsreader starts talking.\n“Good day. My name is Kristina Lawson, reporting from New Jersey,” the anchor says in the nearly minute-long clip. “Just in: We have received a credible report regarding a disturbing incident.” The fake presenter says that a “young lady” has come forward to allege that they were sexually assaulted by an older man. In the video, the man, who is the target of the scam, is named, and a photograph of him appears onscreen.\nOther videos seen by WIRED feature different news readers and names of news channels, but they also show more graphic photos of the potential blackmail targets, including nude and explicit images. In one “news” clip, the screen is split in two, with a photo of a man’s face on one side and the other side is a short video clip of him allegedly masturbating.\nDavid Maimon, the head of fraud insights at SentiLink and a professor at Georgia State University who first spotted the CNN video in December, says the fraudsters have made a number of “disturbing” changes to their blackmailing tactics in recent months, including trying to humiliate people and potentially targeting those outside of English-speaking countries.\nTypically, Yahoo Boy scammers message hundreds of people online while posing as members of the opposite sex using pictures stolen from social media profiles. They run all types of scams, but for those that involve blackmail, they often attempt to build up a relationship with their potential victim and obtain compromising information—most commonly, nude images. Then they shift gears.\n“At some point, they reveal their identity after they get everything that they need, and then they start blackmailing,” Maimon says. They demand money and threaten to release images online or send them to family and friends if they’re not paid. “One of the approaches they use in order to make sure that the blackmail is realistic is actually producing those news clips that they send to the victims and in a way push them, nudge them, to pay the blackmail,” he says. “They try to push you to make decisions under conditions of stress, under conditions of urgency.”\nYahoo Boy fraudsters widely use social media platform Telegram as a way of organizing, chatting with each other, and as a marketplace where they sell knowledge and tutorials about how to operate different types of scams. The “news” videos seen by WIRED appear to include the details and images of real-world victims, although it was not possible to immediately verify the cases.\nBrian Mason, a constable with the Edmonton Police Service in Canada who investigates fraud and works with the victims of scams, says he has seen cases where videos or screenshots of fake CNN broadcasts have been sent to victims. “It looks like your typical CNN broadcast,” Mason says. “It's very, very convincing.” Mason says the approach has been utilized in sextortion scams, which commonly target teenagers and have been linked to a series of suicides.\nMason says he has seen incidents where the news clips falsely accuse scam victims of talking with underage females and that police are searching for them or have issued warrants for their arrest. “It makes the victim panic, because now they’re seeing themselves on this broadcast, and it’s a screen capture from when they were actually talking with the scammer from their own webcam,” Mason adds. The effect can potentially push the person into sending money or following demands from the scammers.\nTelegram spokesperson Remi Vaughn tells WIRED that activities observed in the scammer channels are a violation of the app's rules and suggested the company would take action against such channels.\n“Content encouraging scamming is explicitly forbidden by Telegram's terms of service,” Vaughn says. “Moderators empowered with custom AI and machine learning tools proactively monitor public parts of the platform and accept reports from users and organizations in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.”\nLast year, Telegram removed more than a dozen Yahoo Boy channels after WIRED reported on their public activity; however, the scammers still have a presence on the platform and other social media platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube.\nMessages shared within Telegram channels show how the fraudsters are quick to evolve their cons, use new technologies, and widely share or sell advice with each other. For instance, when people moved to Chinese alternative Rednote ahead of the proposed TikTok ban in the US earlier this month, Yahoo Boys recommended targeting people who had joined the app.\nWithin one Telegram channel, which has 10,000 subscribers, a scammer explained the steps needed to create false news videos and mocked-up front pages of newspapers over a series of messages. “In blackmailing (BM) work we get two different types which are: TV news [and] newspapers,” the first message says.\nIn subsequent messages, they gave examples of text that can be inserted into the script for the news bulletin, which says the alleged victim has been “accused of distributing nude images and videos without consent.” All a scammer following the tutorial needs to do is substitute the name and town of their victim and add any pictures they have.\nThe tutorial suggests headlines for news articles, such as “Local Man Accused of Online Blackmail and Harassment.” It also lists the names of US TV news networks, cable news, and “specialized news”—it listed 17 news outlets ranging from ABC News and Fox News to C-Span and Al Jazeera America. One other cybercriminal shared a video of a folder of blackmail scripts and tutorials needed to create fake news items.\nIn some fabricated news videos, the news anchor appears to be an AI-generated avatar, although it was not possible to determine which software was being used to create the clips. Tutorials shared on Telegram, however, also show that the grifters are not always using sophisticated technology. Some apps they point to are simple “meme generators.”\nLast year, WIRED reported on how Yahoo Boys are adopting deepfake face-swapping technology to make video calls with their targets and try to “prove” their false identities are real. However, Maimon also points to one troubling video shared by Yahoo Boy scammers that appears to show a potential victim making a video to apologize for questioning the scammer’s fake identity.\nWithin the video, the woman says, “I am truly sorry that I called you a fake” and asks the scammer to accept their apology. The individual says they hope they get to meet the person they believe they are in love with in the future, before they start removing their clothes to “make up” for the earlier accusation. “I think that what followed that video was them blackmailing her,” Maimon explains, “and of course posting it on the markets they’re on.”\nUpdated 10:45 am EST, January 28, 2025: Added comment from a Telegram spokesperson.",

    "content_text": "So, here’s a nightmare scenario: You open your work Slack on your phone so you can DM with a few colleagues. You talk with this group regularly, but you don’t see the chat in the list of active DMs on your phone, so you select all of the participants individually to pick the conversation back up. Without thinking too much of it, you accept an odd prompt that asks, “Do you want to include the entire chat history?”\nBecause yes, you think, of course it should include the chat history of the group DM you’ve been chatting in for ages. Who has time for this? There is business to conduct! Essential facts to convey! But the answer here is no, you do not want to do that. Because if you do, you will have ported your entire DM history with the first person you selected for the chat into the group DM.\nThis is not a hypothetical. In fact, this screw-up recently happened to me when I tried to DM two of my bosses, Brian Barrett and Tim Marchman. Suddenly, Tim had full access to years of private conversations between me and Brian, with no apparent way to undo it. “lmao andrew,” Brian wrote, “what have you done.”\nDead. I was, at that moment, obliterated by embarrassment—and worry that I’d just made a catastrophic mistake. I couldn’t even explain what had happened, let alone explain it away.\nOnce I realized I wasn’t going to be escorted into HR, and my heart rate dropped back to normal, I was determined to figure out what went wrong and warn the world not to make the same mistake I made.\nTurns out, this is definitely not a Slack feature—it’s a glitch.\n“This sounds like a mobile app sync issue,” says Slack spokesperson Vince Bitong over email. “Sometimes when switching between desktop and mobile Slack, recent conversations (including group DMs) don't immediately appear in your mobile DM list until the app syncs.”\nBecause my group DM with Brian and Tim didn’t appear in my list of conversations, Bitong adds, “the app treated this as creating a new group conversation. That's why you got the chat history prompt—it was asking if you wanted to include your private chat history with the first colleague into this new group.”\nMy next question, of course, was how Slack users can make sure this never happens—and what to do if it does. “You can go about this in a few ways,” Bitong says. “First, manually pull down to refresh the app. If that doesn't work, fully close and reopen the app.” That should result in your DM list being up to date, which obviates the problem.\nAlso, as mentioned, if you see the “Do you want to include the entire chat history?” prompt for a group DM you know already exists, remember to click “no.” (And even for a new group DM, think very carefully about what might be lurking in that history before you share.)\nAnd if you already messed up like I did and are looking for a way to triage the damage? “One solution is to convert the DM to a private channel, which gives you more control over the conversation history and member access,” Bitong says. You can do this by clicking on the names of the group DM members, click the Settings tab, select the “Change to a private channel” option, then remove whoever it is that shouldn’t be reading the chat history you just accidentally shared.\nThinking back, I still feel pings of shame from this experience—and not a small amount of relief that I did not get fired for what I assumed at the time was a terrible Slack feature combined with me being a huge dumbass. Fortunately, Brian and I are boring DMers—no trash-talking Tim (who is lovely!), or anyone else for that matter.\nYou can easily imagine, though, all the many terrible things that could have been exposed. Petty complaints about Tim’s management style, personality, or personal hygiene. Plans to undermine his projects. Personal information that you might be comfortable sharing with one colleague but not a larger group. Name calling, workplace gossip, nasty nicknames—the list of bad outcomes is virtually infinite.\nIn fact, that’s the most important lesson from this stupid ordeal: The safest way to ensure your life isn’t ruined by ill-advised things you say on Slack is to not say them at all.",

    "content_text": "You might have thought sticks had gone away. Oh boy, no. The game of Kubb? Throwing sticks. Conducting? Waving a stick around. Harry Potter merch. Fetch. Drumming. There’s even a stick appreciation movement, via Stick Nation’s “reviews” of cool finds in nature by “Stick Heads” that are posted on Instagram and TikTok. It makes you think.\nWhich brings us to the Veark Tool One. You already know what it is. But twist: There are three of them, they’re $68 (£55) for the set (yes), and they’re designed to be used as cooking utensils.\nTool One is the brainchild of Copenhagen-based designer and artist Kim Richardt. Around four years ago, deep in the pandemic era, Richardt says he simply got fed up with his spoons. “I was a little irritated, my spoons didn’t quite work with the casseroles I was cooking, so I thought maybe I could do something else,” he says.\n“It was straight to this. I went out to the wood store, bought three pieces of wood around 30 centimeters, went to my workshop, and I just made a set of these for myself. First take. It felt right. It was so intuitive to work with.”\nThe Tool One is indeed a pimped stick—handmade from beechwood, the three cooking sticks are 1 centimeter, 1.6 cm, and 2.2 cm wide, with tilted sides on the lower half, rounded to grip at the top.\n“The big one is actually fantastic to make an overnight sourdough,” Richardt says, “because when you use a wooden spoon to stir the sourdough, it’s very heavy and you get tired in your arm before you get the gluten effect.”\nIn his culinary experiments, he has used his new tools for everything from stirring cocktails to flipping fried fish in a pan: “It’s a tool that you just take out and maybe find your own needs for, actually. It’s not that dictated.” So universal functionality abounds! There is no specialist stick here, folks.\nAlongside making steel, brass, and wooden sculptures, Richardt has created minimalist designs for more than a decade for Danish design studio Frama: A day bed, a lounge chair, candle holders, a shelving system, a “very minimalist” lamp for the restaurant Noma.\nFrama passed on Tool One, though, so Richardt kept it at home until he stumbled on kitchenware studio Veark, also in Copenhagen, which makes tools inspired by professional kitchens. For cofounders Daniel Ronge and Christian Lorentzen, it was love at first stick.\nWe jest about the sheer simplicity of this thing, but Richardt’s inspiration came, of course, partly from utensils in Asia. Cooking chopsticks, often made from bamboo, have long been used by professional stir-fry chefs for tasting and sampling in the kitchen.\n“I had some chopsticks at home that I used to stir my oatmeal in the morning for a couple of years, and it was a little too small for doing that,” he says. “Then I thought I could make it larger into a design that could also flip a pancake. In Japan they actually have some rather big chopsticks, but they still use them in pairs when they stir, and they’re quite fun to handle.”\nAnd there is more practicality. Wooden utensils can last for decades versus years for silicon alternatives (if properly cleaned and stored), and there has been a lot of discussion of late over how many toxic chemicals regular black plastic spatulas might expose users to.\nIn design terms, it’s clear we’ve been heading in this direction for a while, primed to crave more and more of less and less. Minimalist Joseph Joseph kitchen tools and stacking bowls we’ve been strangely drawn to for some time, while Jony Ive has done for computers what his predecessors in industrial design did for, say, iconic chairs and lamps.\nAbstract wooden Scandi baby toys in beige, cream, and cool grays, though, can be quite infuriating. They should be bright red and bright green and make lots of noise. And blocky, featureless nativity sets we cannot abide. Ludicrous. They are simply taking the piss. But I think we can safely say that you cannot get more minimalist than a stick.\nAs WIRED senior editor Jeremy White exclaims, “How can something so ridiculous be so desirable?” Is a stirring stick inherently more macho than a spoon, perhaps? More like something The Bear’s Carmy Berzatto might throw across a kitchen?\n“It’s a humble tool. I was surprised at the simple thing of having a stick stirring your food,” says Richardt with a little laugh. “It took me back to something … I couldn’t explain it, but it was a nice feeling. I kind of felt that I was taken back to the Neanderthals.”",

You also may have a lot more to worry about beyond just the cost of replacing the phone. What if they saw me enter the passcode and now have easy access to all of my messages, photos, and sensitive information? While it definitely sucks to have your smartphone nabbed, turning on Apple’s Stolen Device protection can immediately cut thieves’ access to your smartphone data. This feature is not automatically enabled and needs to be activated before the crime occurs.\nFirst released as part of iOS 17.3, Stolen Device Protection essentially adds an extra layer of security to your smartphone whenever the device is somewhere you don’t regularly visit. Here’s a quick guide to what the software feature does and what steps are necessary to turn it on.\nFor a deeper dive into Apple’s anti-theft software, check out WIRED security reporter Matt Burgess’s article about the feature from last year. If you have an Android phone, read my guide to using Android's theft detection features.\nWhat Does Stolen Device Protection Do?\nThe feature is specifically designed for situations where a criminal not only takes your iPhone but also knows your passcode and can unlock the device. When they physically take your phone away from you and bring it to a location you don’t frequently visit, then the Stolen Device Protection security measures begin to kick in.\nThe main thing the feature triggers is it starts requiring your Face ID biometrics to access any sensitive features on the phone, like using your Keychain passwords, seeing your stored payment information in Safari, and disabling Lost Mode. Even if the thieves know your passcode, it will no longer work as a backup option; Face ID becomes required for full access. This also prevents thieves from easily wiping all your data off the phone so they can sell it, as that procedure requires FaceID as well.\nIn addition to forcing biometric authentication, Stolen Device Protection adds a security delay period for changes to safety features on the phone. If the thief wants to sign out of your Apple ID or turn off Find My iPhone, for example, they can’t just hold up the phone in front of your face for a few seconds as they flee the scene of the crime. With the feature’s automatic security delay, you have to wait an hour to make major safety changes to the device, and you have to confirm your biometrics at the beginning as well as at the end of this process.\nHow Do I Turn It On?\nBefore you’re able to turn on Stolen Device Protection, you first need to set up a few other basic features on your smartphone. You probably already have Face ID and a passcode enabled on your Apple device—both of these are necessary for the feature to work.\nNext, you’ll need to check whether two-factor authentication is enabled for your Apple ID, which is a good idea even if you aren’t using Stolen Device Protection. Check to see if you’re already using this by going to Settings, tapping on your name at the top, and then choosing the Sign-In & Security tab. You should see whether 2FA for your Apple ID is on or off in the middle of this screen.\nThe last software feature you need to activate on the iPhone is Significant Locations. This keeps track of places you regularly visit, so your phone can detect whether it’s in a familiar or unfamiliar place. According to Apple, the data is end-to-end encrypted and is not read by the company. Significant Locations is a bit buried in the menus—find it by opening Settings, then Privacy & Security, and Location Services. After that, scroll all the way down until you see the System Services tab. Select Significant Locations, and you’ll likely be prompted to unlock it with Face ID. On the next page, move the toggle to the right to finish enabling the feature.\nPhew! OK, now you’re ready to start using Stolen Device Protection. And, lucky for you, after all of that prep work, the last step is a breeze. Open Settings one more time, then Face ID & Passcode, and fill out your passcode. Scroll about halfway down on the page, choose the Stolen Device Protection tab, and move that toggle to the right.",

    "content_text": "What if there were a simple technique that let you photograph what’s directly in front of you and what’s behind you at the same exact time, in the same exact frame? Stefan Falke found a way to capture everything that’s around him not in a distorted 360-degree image but a completely flat perspective.\nIt all started as a visual experiment. One day in 2023, Falke bought a handheld mirror from CVS for $10 with only a vague idea of what he wanted to do with it artistically. He wandered down to the Empire State Building and held the mirror up in front of the lens, directly in the middle of the frame. The squarish mirror captured the Hudson Yards in the reflection.\nReflecting New York is a series of perfectly matched reflections, a pairing of both what’s directly in front of the artist and what’s behind him. Falke perfects the graphics of buildings, trees, and bridges with just a slight manual adjustment to what the mirror captures. “I realized soon that the mirror was an actor in the image, not just the reflection in it,” says Falke. “Then came my hand, which I tried to avoid showing at first, but it became an important part of the series. It became the story: A handheld mirror, my mirror, creates unusual visuals in familiar places.”\nFalke loves to shoot midday in bright light, when most photographers hide. He calls it the “Kodak light.” He requires plenty of daylight because the f-stop is rather tight, controlling the amount of light that enters the lens in order to get sharpness throughout the mirrored picture and the background too. The shutter speed needs to be very fast, too, because the constantly moving mirror, wind factor, one-handed camera holding, and other factors make it difficult to freeze the reflected image. It is enormously difficult to hold the mirror with one hand and shoot with a fairly heavy Nikon D850 in the other and focus on two images at once, aligning everything perfectly.\nFalke never knows what he will shoot or in what direction he’ll wander when he ventures out; he doesn’t plan around the position of the sun, or plan at all really; everything is based on location, and every photograph in the series is found rather than scripted.\nWhen I asked Falke what his favorite image from this series was, he claimed the photograph of Luna Park in Brooklyn's Coney Island with the Cyclone Roller Coaster in the mirror. “It has the perfect composition, color, elements, mood, and my hand and mirror have the right energy,” he says. “Love it.”",

Learn more.\nWould you buy tech hardware from a company best known for making soap?\nCult British cosmetics brand Lush, famed for inventing the bath bomb, is attempting to forge the category of bathroom tech with its first foray into electronics: the Bath Bot, a small, water resistant Bluetooth speaker with colour-changing LEDs that can float in the tub while you soak.\nThe Bath Bot is roughly the size and shape of a Lush bath bomb—spherical on top with a hexagonal base—and can be connected with Lush’s app to play music and soundscapes designed to match the vibe of the brand's famous bath products.\nTrue to Lush’s values, the company claims the speaker is designed with ethics front and center: It’s manufactured in the UK (where it is based), recyclable, and vegan (which basically means it doesn’t use glue). But did I mention it costs $180?\nAdam Goswell, Lush’s tech R&D lead, says the company’s hardware ambitions started with a 2017 trip to Chinese tech hub Shenzhen. At that time, the team had a more ambitious goal in mind: They wanted to build their own tablet. Inspired by the likes of Fairphone, they wondered if, rather than buying thousands of off-the-shelf tablets for their employees to use in-store, they could work with suppliers to produce something as ethically sourced as possible.\nBut the team soon realised that tech is trickier than toiletries in this regard. “Trying to do the supply chain interrogation we do with our normal cosmetics on electronics got really difficult,” Goswell says. They’d ask where a battery came from, or where the components within the battery came from, and suppliers either didn’t know or wouldn’t say. They shelved the tablet idea and eventually landed on Bath Bot as their first hardware project.\nAnnounced over a year ago, the Bot has taken longer than expected to get to market, with some customers complaining about unfulfilled pre-orders or wondering if the product is vaporware. The reason for the delay, says Goswell, was due to Lush’s lack of experience with electronics. The product was ready, but they hadn’t realised how long it would take to get the relevant certifications needed to sell such a device. The Bath Bot is now available in the UK, EU, and will soon be in the US (excepting California, which has extra regulations).\nSome compromises still had to be made during the development. “The components in there aren’t what we would deem as 100 percent ethical, but we tried our best,” says Goswell. The team had wanted to use recycled materials out of environmental concerns but had to opt for virgin plastic to keep the device waterproof. The end result is recyclable though, and Lush says buyers will be able to bring theirs in-store for repairs if needed.\nManufacturing electronics inevitably comes with a carbon cost, but Goswell believes the Bath Bot's is justifiable. “If it was a single-use device or a cheap, throw-away one that broke within six months, I think that would be a different question, but we’ve made it to last,” he says.\nIndeed, a cheap device it is not. The £150 price tag has raised eyebrows even among ardent Lush fans on forums such as the 115k-member r/LushCosmetics subreddit. As one “Lushie” put it, “Why would I buy a $200 speaker from a bath store?” You can get a waterproof Bluetooth speaker from established brands for significantly less, likely with better sound quality: Ultimate Ears’ floating Wonderboom 4 retails for around $100 (and often sells for less), while JBL's cheapest waterproof speakers can sell for as little as $40—you can find some even cheaper on Amazon.\nThe reasons for the high price, Goswell says, include the fact that it’s Lush’s first tech product and the company is not making that many, both of which drive up costs. Trying to choose more ethical components adds to the price, as does manufacturing in the UK. Ultimately, he says, Lush doesn’t want to pitch the Bath Bot against other Bluetooth speakers but sees it as more of a lifestyle accessory, akin to something like a Philips Hue lamp. While it’s designed for use in the bath, he also likes to take it with him to hotel rooms for ambient lighting.\nI decide to test the Bath Bot in its intended environment, running a bath and setting up the Lush app ready to connect. Bath drawn, I drop the bath bot into the water where it duly floats around, cycling through coloured lights that give the illusion of dyeing the bathwater around me. Available in black or white, the Bath Bot has just four buttons—on/off, play/pause, and two volume controls. When I turn it on, it emits a particularly pleasing startup sound featuring birdsong and a few gentle guitar notes.\nIn the Lush app, I find a playlist that matches the bath bomb I’m using: Ickle Bot ($8, sold separately), a baby blue, robot-shaped thing. I chose it because it looked cute, but as the playlist opens with lullaby-style music, I realise it may be intended for children (afterwards, I look online and see that it is indeed suitable for ages six months and above).\nRegardless, the experience starts off appropriately relaxing; an indie singer croons soothingly over gentle piano in a track like a slowed-down sea shanty, while the multicoloured LEDs cycle in tempo. Most of the music in the Lush app is from Lush’s own record label; the company commissions music for its spas and occasionally releases records. The sound quality isn’t up to that of my usual UE Boom portable speaker, but it’s perfectly adequate for the job and perhaps better than I expected given the speaker size—at least in the less-than-ideal testing environment of my rather echoey bathroom.\nMy peaceful bathing is somewhat disrupted, however, when the first Ickle Bot song segues into ambient sounds of water splashing and children shrieking. This not being my idea of relaxation, I try some of the other playlists, designed around different bath bombs. Magic Bus plays rather generic-sounding rave beats; Sex Bomb starts with some bell chiming that I don’t find particularly seductive. Annoyingly, I also find that the music stops playing when I click to explore different parts of the Lush app or open other apps on my phone.\nAfter a while, I head to Spotify and choose music I know I actually like, which I imagine is how most people will end up using the Bath Bot. When I shift in the water, the speaker bobs about; it sounds louder or quieter as it floats from my shoulders to my feet and occasionally clunks inelegantly against the side of the tub.\nAs I go to pull out the plug, I’ve had an enjoyable bath, but I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a “super-powered sensory bathing experience,” as Lush advertises. And despite Goswell’s protestations that the Bath Bot is a product for the long-term, I can’t help but think that many may use it a few times before discarding it as a gimmick.\nGoswell admits that making the Bath Bot was a risk; the company spent “significant money” on R&D and manufacturing to make a product that you wouldn’t expect from a cosmetics company. But he insists that even if it turns out not to be a commercial success, the process of developing a first hardware product has been invaluable. His team is now considering making Bath Bot accessories and more content for the app. They’re also thinking up other bathroom tech—one suggestion is using the water flow from a shower to power a device, like hydropower on a tiny scale.\nBut their ambitions also stretch further. Headquartered in Poole, on the UK’s south coast, the company is interested in larger-scale tidal power and has just co-funded a three-year PhD studentship at nearby Bournemouth University.\nWhile this will explore the development of a new tidal energy station at Poole Harbor to power Lush's head office operations, Goswell also floats the idea of using tidal to power servers for a large language model. It could be a way, he says, of creating an AI-assisted digital experience while mitigating some of the carbon concerns.",

    "content_text": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nFar from being solo operators, most single-celled microbes are in complex relationships. In the ocean, the soil, and your gut, they might battle and eat each other, exchange DNA, compete for nutrients, or feed on one another’s by-products. Sometimes they get even more intimate: One cell might slip inside another and make itself comfortable. If the conditions are just right, it might stay and be welcomed, sparking a relationship that could last for generations—or billions of years. This phenomenon of one cell living inside another, called endosymbiosis, has fueled the evolution of complex life.\nExamples of endosymbiosis are everywhere. Mitochondria, the energy factories in your cells, were once free-living bacteria. Photosynthetic plants owe their sun-spun sugars to the chloroplast, which was also originally an independent organism. Many insects get essential nutrients from bacteria that live inside them. And last year researchers discovered the “nitroplast,” an endosymbiont that helps some algae process nitrogen.\nSo much of life relies on endosymbiotic relationships, but scientists have struggled to understand how they happen. How does an internalized cell evade digestion? How does it learn to reproduce inside its host? What makes a random merger of two independent organisms into a stable, lasting partnership?\nNow, for the first time, researchers have watched the opening choreography of this microscopic dance by inducing endosymbiosis in the lab. After injecting bacteria into a fungus—a process that required creative problem-solving (and a bicycle pump)—the researchers managed to spark cooperation without killing the bacteria or the host. Their observations offer a glimpse into the conditions that make it possible for the same thing to happen in the microbial wild.\nThe cells even adjusted to each other faster than anticipated. “To me, this means that organisms want to actually live together, and symbiosis is the norm,” said Vasilis Kokkoris, a mycologist who studies the cell biology of symbiosis at VU University in Amsterdam and wasn’t involved in the new study. “So that’s big, big news for me and for this world.”\nEarly attempts that fell short reveal that most cellular love affairs are unsuccessful. But by understanding how, why, and when organisms accept endosymbionts, researchers can better understand key moments in evolution, and also potentially develop synthetic cells engineered with superpowered endosymbionts.\nThe Cell Wall Breakthrough\nJulia Vorholt, a microbiologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich in Switzerland, has long puzzled over the circumstances of endosymbiosis. Researchers in the field theorized that once a bacterium sneaks into a host cell, the relationship teeters between infection and harmony. If the bacterium reproduces too quickly, it risks depleting the host’s resources and triggering an immune response, resulting in the death of the guest, the host, or both. If it reproduces too slowly, it won’t establish itself in the cell. Only in rare cases, they thought, does the bacterium achieve a Goldilocks reproductive rate. Then, to become a true endosymbiont, it must infiltrate its host’s reproductive cycle to hitch a ride to the next generation. Finally, the host’s genome must eventually mutate to accommodate the bacterium—allowing the two to evolve as a unit.\n“They become addicted to each other,” Vorholt said.\nThese ideas made logical sense, but no one had ever witnessed the early steps of microbial endosymbiosis. So Vorholt decided to try to make it happen in the lab. Rather than reinventing the endosymbiotic wheel, she thought her team would have its best shot if it re-created a partnership that had already occurred in nature.\nRice seedling blight is a disease caused by the toxic by-product of a wild, endosymbiotic affair. At some point in its evolutionary history, the fungus Rhizopus microsporus adopted the bacterium Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica. The bacterial resident produces poison, which the fungus uses to infect rice plants; both partners benefit by absorbing nutrients from the dead and dying plant cells. Over generations, the pair have become so intertwined that now the fungus can’t reproduce without its endosymbiont.\nHowever, there is a strain of the fungus that lives without the endosymbiont. Vorholt thought she could use it to re-create the poisonous partnership. Before she got to the harder steps of cellular matchmaking, though, her team had to overcome a basic physical constraint: How do you physically squeeze a bacterium through a fungus’s rigid cell wall?\nGabriel Giger, lead author on the paper and Vorholt’s graduate student, started by cooking up a cocktail of enzymes to soften the wall. Then he used an atomic force microscope equipped with a technology known as FluidFM, repurposed to serve as a tiny syringe. When Giger punctured the fungal cell with the microneedle, cytoplasm came rushing out like water from a burst dam.\n“We had so much backflush,” Giger said. “[The cell fluid] just comes shooting right at you.”\nHe needed something with more oomph to resist the intracellular pressure and push the bacteria in. Giger jury-rigged a connection between his bike pump and the microscope. It worked: The bike pump boosted the pressure and forced the bacteria through the cell wall and into the cytoplasm.\nAfter tinkering with different amounts of pressure, they refined the system. “The way they adapted technology to inject the bacteria into fungus is really, really cool,” said Thomas Richards, an evolutionary biologist who studies endosymbiosis at the University of Oxford and wasn’t involved in the study. “They had to use special sharpened needles and then three times the tire pressure of car tires to push that bacteria inside. That represents a big technological step forward.”\nGiger and Vorholt first injected the fungus with Escherichia coli, a standard bacterial lab organism. Once inside, E. coli reproduced quickly as it fed on nutrients within the cell. The bacteria grew so fast that the fungal immune system noticed them—and handily locked them away for disposal.\nThen the researchers moved on to M. rhizoxinica, the bacteria already established within other R. microsporus strains. Once inside, it divided at an agreeable rate and evaded the immune response. Most importantly, neither partner died. “It was already super exciting to see that both the fungus and the bacteria grew after injection,” Giger said\nThe pair had initially accepted each other, but that was only the first step. Giger patiently waited, and then he saw what he was looking for under the microscope: The bacteria had wiggled their way into the fungal spores to hitchhike to the next generation.\n“I had to make sure the signal was the real deal, and you don’t sleep soundly until you know,” he said. “The excitement lasted for quite a while.”\nGiger and the team hand-selected spores and germinated 10 successive generations of fungi. More bacteria survived in each reproductive round, and the spores got healthier and more efficient. For the first time, researchers watched endosymbiotic and host microbes adapt to each other. “Neither of these organisms is poisoning each other, and their growth rates roughly match this spectrum of viability for both,” Giger recalled. The bacteria survived, protected and fed by the fungus—and the fungus scored a poisonous partner.\nTo confirm the microbial partnership, the lab isolated both parties to analyze their genomes. Already, the fungus genome had gained mutations to accommodate the bacteria. Clearly, these relationships can stabilize quickly, the researchers saw. Soon the two species couldn’t live without each other.\nStriking the Right Balance\nBy re-creating a natural relationship, Vorholt and Giger have “rerun that tape of evolution,” Richards said, to learn lessons about how endosymbiosis happens. They concluded that the process can’t happen if there is a mismatch between host and endosymbiont at any point in the adaptation process. “That’s probably what happens in nature a lot,” Vorholt said. “Maybe their starting points are successful, but somehow the selection is not there, or there is a cost rather than a benefit. And then you just lose the system, and it doesn’t get stabilized.”\nThey also learned that in pairings that work, both partners adapt to each other—a phenomenon that has been largely overlooked. It wasn’t just the bacteria adapting to a new environment; the host changed too, even in the early stages. “That is a fundamentally important question that people have ignored,” Richards said. “This opens the doors for real advances.”\nWhile illuminating, this bacterium-fungus pairing is only one example of a process that may have a number of mechanisms or conditions. “I can imagine that in protists and other groups that have not been well studied, we will find many new patterns of how symbiosis is supported,” said Laila Partida Martínez, who discovered the rice seedling–blight endosymbiosis and is now director of Cinvestav Irapuato, a plant science research institute in Mexico.\nMore research in a variety of endosymbiotic systems will reveal which conditions apply generally and which are specific to certain pairs. Further down the line, those findings could lead to a new kind of synthetic biology, featuring lab-grown endosymbiotic relationships, which could be a “fascinating avenue to explore biological innovation,” Vorholt said.\nInstead of editing organisms’ genes to create new traits, labs could engineer bacteria to perform specific functions and then slip them into hosts. “Many new features could be brought together in a symbiotic system by doing this and making them evolve together,” Partida Martínez said. By inducing endosymbiosis, researchers could potentially engineer plants to metabolize pollutants or manufacture medicines. “It will take time to design and to really tune the systems,” she added. “I think our imagination would be actually the limit.”\nDoes that mean we could one day gain chloroplasts and become photosynthetic? Giger thinks it would be difficult for a chloroplast to stabilize inside a mammalian cell. Even if it did work, photosynthesis alone wouldn’t fuel us—our energy demands are too high. “You might get fancy green skin and run a little bit on your own photovoltaics, but the energy gain that you could get from the sun would be minimal,” he said. “You’d go hungry a lot and need to supplement with other staples, such as pizza.”\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

In the ocean, the soil, and your gut, they might battle and eat each other, exchange <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/dna/\">DNA</a>, compete for nutrients, or feed on one another’s by-products. Sometimes they get even more intimate: One <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/cells/\">cell</a> might slip inside another and make itself comfortable. If the conditions are just right, it might stay and be welcomed, sparking a relationship that could last for generations—or billions of years. This phenomenon of one cell living inside another, called endosymbiosis, has fueled the evolution of complex life.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">Examples of endosymbiosis are everywhere. Mitochondria, the energy factories in your cells, <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/meet-the-eukaryote-the-first-cell-to-get-organized-20241028/\">were once free-living bacteria</a>. Photosynthetic plants owe their sun-spun sugars to the chloroplast, which was also originally an independent organism. Many insects get essential nutrients <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/symbiotic-bacteria-tell-ant-embryos-how-to-develop-20200909/\">from bacteria that live inside them</a>. And last year researchers <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adk1075\" target=\"_blank\">discovered the “nitroplast,”</a> an endosymbiont that helps some algae process nitrogen.</p><p class=\"paywall\">So much of life relies on endosymbiotic relationships, but scientists have struggled to understand how they happen. How does an internalized cell evade digestion? How does it learn to reproduce inside its host? What makes a random merger of two independent organisms into a stable, lasting partnership?</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Now, for the first time, researchers have watched the opening choreography of this microscopic dance by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08010-x\" target=\"_blank\">inducing endosymbiosis in the lab</a>. After injecting bacteria into a fungus—a process that required creative problem-solving (and a bicycle pump)—the researchers managed to spark cooperation without killing the bacteria or the host. Their observations offer a glimpse into the conditions that make it possible for the same thing to happen in the microbial wild.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The cells even adjusted to each other faster than anticipated. “To me, this means that organisms want to actually live together, and symbiosis is the norm,” said <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.vasilis-kokkoris.com/about-me\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.vasilis-kokkoris.com/about-me\" href=\"https://www.vasilis-kokkoris.com/about-me\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vasilis Kokkoris</a>, a mycologist who studies the cell biology of symbiosis at VU University in Amsterdam and wasn’t involved in the new study. “So that’s big, big news for me and for this world.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Early attempts that fell short reveal that most cellular love affairs are unsuccessful. But by understanding how, why, and when organisms accept endosymbionts, researchers can better understand key moments in evolution, and also potentially develop synthetic cells engineered with superpowered endosymbionts.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">The Cell Wall Breakthrough</h2><p class=\"paywall\"><a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://micro.biol.ethz.ch/research/vorholt.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://micro.biol.ethz.ch/research/vorholt.html\" href=\"https://micro.biol.ethz.ch/research/vorholt.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Julia Vorholt</a>, a microbiologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich in Switzerland, has long puzzled over the circumstances of endosymbiosis. Researchers in the field theorized that once a bacterium sneaks into a host cell, the relationship teeters between infection and harmony. If the bacterium reproduces too quickly, it risks depleting the host’s resources and triggering an immune response, resulting in the death of the guest, the host, or both. If it reproduces too slowly, it won’t establish itself in the cell. Only in rare cases, they thought, does the bacterium achieve a Goldilocks reproductive rate. Then, to become a true endosymbiont, it must infiltrate its host’s reproductive cycle to hitch a ride to the next generation. Finally, the host’s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/genomics/\">genome</a> must eventually mutate to accommodate the bacterium—allowing the two to evolve as a unit.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“They become addicted to each other,” Vorholt said.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Although fans of A Song of Ice and Fire might still be hankering for the long-delayed next book in the series, bestselling sci-fi/fantasy author George R.R. Martin has instead added a different item to his long list of publications: a peer-reviewed physics paper just published in the American Journal of Physics that he coauthored. The paper derives a formula to describe the dynamics of a fictional virus that is the centerpiece of the Wild Cards series of books, a shared universe edited by Martin and Melinda M. Snodgrass, with some 44 authors contributing.\nWild Cards grew out of the Superworld RPG, specifically a long-running campaign game-mastered by Martin in the 1980s, with several of the original sci-fi writers who contributed to the series participating. (A then-unknown Neil Gaiman once pitched Martin a Wild Cards story involving a main character who lived in a world of dreams. Martin rejected the pitch, and Gaiman’s idea became The Sandman.) Initially, Martin planned to write a novel centered on his character Turtle, but he then decided it would be better as a shared universe anthology. Martin thought that superhero comics had far too many sources of the many different superpowers and wanted his universe to have one single source. Snodgrass suggested a virus.\nThe series is basically an alternate history of the US in the aftermath of World War II. An airborne alien virus, designed to rewrite DNA, had been released over New York City in 1946 and spread globally, infecting tens of thousands worldwide. It's called the Wild Card virus because it affects every individual differently. It kills 90 percent of those it infects and mutates the rest. Nine percent of the latter end up with unpleasant conditions—these people are called Jokers—while 1 percent develop superpowers and are known as Aces. Some Aces have “powers” that are so trivial and useless that they are known as “deuces.”\nThere has been considerable speculation on the Wild Cards website discussing the science behind that virus, and it caught the attention of Ian Tregillis, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, who thought it might make a useful pedagogical exercise. “Being a theoretician, I couldn't help but wonder if a simple underlying model might tidy up the canon,” Tregillis said. “Like any physicist, I started with back-of-the-envelope estimates, but then I went off the deep end. Eventually I suggested, only half-jokingly, that it might be easier to write a genuine physics paper than another blog post.”\nA Physicist Walks Into a Fictional Universe …\nTregillis naturally engaged in a bit of willing suspension of disbelief, given that the question of how any virus could give humans superpowers that defy the laws of physics is inherently unanswerable. He focused on the origin of the Wild Cards universe's 90:9:1 rule, adopting the mindset of an in-universe theoretician keen to build a coherent mathematical framework that could describe the viral behavior. The ultimate goal was to “demonstrate the wide-ranging flexibility and utility of physics concepts by converting this vague and seemingly unapproachable problem to a straightforward dynamic system, thereby putting a wealth of conceptual and mathematical tools at students’ disposal,” Tregillis and Martin wrote in their paper.\nAmong the issues the paper addresses is the problem of Jokers and Aces as \"mutually exclusive categories with a numerical distribution attainable to the roll of a hundred-sided die,\" the authors wrote. \"Yet the canon abounds with characters who confound this categorization: 'Joker-Aces,' who exhibit both a physical mutation and a superhuman ability.\"\nThey also suggest the existence of \"cryptos\": Jokers and Aces with mutations that are largely unobservable, such as producing ultraviolet racing stripes on someone's heart or imbuing \"a resident of Iowa with the power of line-of-sight telepathic communication with narwhals. The first individual would be unaware of their Jokerism; the second would be an Ace but never known it.\" (One might argue that communicating with narwhals might make one a Deuce.)\nIn the end, Tregillis and Martin came up with three ground rules: (1) cryptos exist, but how many of them exist is \"unknown and unknowable\"; (2) observable card turns would be distributed according to the 90:9:1 rule; and (3) viral outcomes would be determined by a multivariate probability distribution.\nThe resulting proposed model assumes two apparently random variables: severity of the transformation—i.e., how much the virus changes a person, either in the severity of a Joker's deformation or the potency of an Ace's superpower—and a mixing angle to address the existence of Joker-Aces. \"Card turns that land sufficiently close to one axis will subjectively present as Aces, while otherwise they will present as Jokers or Joker-Aces,\" the authors wrote.\nThe derived formula is one that takes into account the many different ways a given system can evolve (aka a Langrangian formulation). “We translated the abstract problem of Wild Card viral outcomes into a simple, concrete dynamical system. The time-averaged behavior of this system generates the statistical distribution of outcomes,” said Tregillis.\nTregillis acknowledges that this might not be a good exercise for the beginning physics student, given that it involves multiple steps and covers many concepts that younger students might not fully comprehend. Nor does he suggest adding it to the core curriculum. Instead, he recommends it for senior honors seminars to encourage students to explore an open-ended research question.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "After Google’s beta test in Brazil, the initial suite of theft protection features for Android smartphones is now widely available—but you have to opt in.\nWhy isn’t the company automatically adding the protections to every compatible device? Insight from the Brazil beta test helped developers at the company make this decision. “We learned that users behaved very differently in metropolitan areas and in rural areas,” says Jianing Sandra Guo, an Android security and privacy product manager at Google. She doesn’t want to add unnecessary friction for users who aren’t as interested in the anti-theft software.\nThree features many Android owners can activate now are Theft Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, and Remote Lock. Curious about using these protective features on your Android smartphone? Here’s a peek into how the detection happens using artificial intelligence and steps for how to activate the anti-theft features.\nHow Does Android Theft Detection Work?\nSince many thefts can be violent or involve sudden, jerky movements, Guo sought ad vice from Google’s Activity Recognition team, which worked on a somewhat similar feature available on Pixel smartphones for car crash detection. “At a very high level, it starts with motion sensors,” she says. But, an approach solely focused on sudden movements could lead to so many false triggers, users would likely find the option more annoying than beneficial—and that’s where machine learning, a segment of AI focused on pattern recognition, comes into play.\nThe Google developers researched smartphone theft methods used in different parts of the globe and role-played the robberies for training data. “We reenact those scenarios. Then we gather the trace of the device,” says Guo. “We use AI to compile those traces into a model to try to predict the next time when a snatch happens.” For Android owners, this process is done using on-device models.\nThe AI model is not static, and developers plan to continue adding new smartphone theft scenarios to the training data as criminals modify their behavior. Also, with the global launch of these anti-theft features, they can now learn more about how a diverse group of smartphone owners actually interact with these options.\nHow Do I Turn It On?\nGo ahead and see if your phone is running a recent version of the Android operating system. Your device needs to be on at least Android 10 to run these three features, and the latest Android 15 software gives you access to more security options. It’s a basic first step, but if you haven’t already, also add a passcode to your device by going into the privacy settings.\nNext, open the Settings app on your phone and search for Theft protection. Opening this tab will show the three lock screen safety features. “It's very common for the cell phone to assume that the person who has access to it is the rightful owner,” says Guo. By adding more ways to activate the lock screen, users have more protections if their phone is nabbed while open. When the Theft Detection Lock is toggled on, the screen will automatically lock if it detects a potential robbery, based on movement patterns as well as whether your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth remains connected.\nWith Offline Device Lock activated, your phone will go to the lock screen, up to twice a day, if the internet is suddenly turned off for a while or airplane mode is activated. “From our market research, that is a common attack that they carry out after taking an unlocked device,” says Guo. Why would thieves do this? When a device is offline, it can’t be remotely reset via Find My Device to clear your personal information from the device.\nThe third lock screen security option available on this page is Remote Lock. You’ll have to click on the name to see this toggle, unlike the first two options. The feature is designed to give you a quick, easily accessible choice to lock your phone by visiting android.com/lock on any device and entering your phone number. However, Remote Lock will only work twice a day and activate when the smartphone is online.",

For instance, our analysis of data from market research company Ipsos spanning 27 countries reveals that people in nations with lower average AI literacy are more receptive toward AI adoption than those in nations with higher literacy.\nSimilarly, our survey of US undergraduate students finds that those with less understanding of AI are more likely to indicate using it for tasks like academic assignments.\nThe reason behind this link lies in how AI now performs tasks we once thought only humans could do. When AI creates a piece of art, writes a heartfelt response, or plays a musical instrument, it can feel almost magical—like it’s crossing into human territory.\nOf course, AI doesn’t actually possess human qualities. A chatbot might generate an empathetic response, but it doesn’t feel empathy. People with more technical knowledge about AI understand this.\nThey know how algorithms (sets of mathematical rules used by computers to carry out particular tasks), training data (used to improve how an AI system works), and computational models operate. This makes the technology less mysterious.\nOn the other hand, those with less understanding may see AI as magical and awe inspiring. We suggest this sense of magic makes them more open to using AI tools.\nOur studies show this lower literacy-higher receptivity link is strongest for using AI tools in areas people associate with human traits, like providing emotional support or counseling. When it comes to tasks that don’t evoke the same sense of humanlike qualities—such as analyzing test results—the pattern flips. People with higher AI literacy are more receptive to these uses because they focus on AI’s efficiency, rather than any “magical” qualities.\nIt’s Not About Capability, Fear, or Ethics\nInterestingly, this link between lower literacy and higher receptivity persists even though people with lower AI literacy are more likely to view AI as less capable, less ethical, and even a bit scary. Their openness to AI seems to stem from their sense of wonder about what it can do, despite these perceived drawbacks.\nThis finding offers new insights into why people respond so differently to emerging technologies. Some studies suggest consumers favour new tech, a phenomenon called “algorithm appreciation,” while others show skepticism, or “algorithm aversion.” Our research points to perceptions of AI’s “magicalness” as a key factor shaping these reactions.\nThese insights pose a challenge for policymakers and educators. Efforts to boost AI literacy might unintentionally dampen people’s enthusiasm for using AI by making it seem less magical. This creates a tricky balance between helping people understand AI and keeping them open to its adoption.\nTo make the most of AI’s potential, businesses, educators and policymakers need to strike this balance. By understanding how perceptions of “magicalness” shape people’s openness to AI, we can help develop and deploy new AI-based products and services that take the way people view AI into account, and help them understand the benefits and risks of AI.\nAnd ideally, this will happen without causing a loss of the awe that inspires many people to embrace this new technology.",

    "content_text": "This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nWhat’s shaping up to be one of the worst wildfire disasters in US history had many causes. Before the blazes raged across Los Angeles last week, eight months with hardly any rain had left the brush-covered landscape bone-dry. Santa Ana winds blew through the mountains, their gusts turning small fires into infernos and sending embers flying miles ahead. As many as 12,000 buildings have burned down, some hundred thousand people have fled their homes, and at least two dozen people have died.\nAs winds picked up again this week, key questions about the fires remain unanswered: What sparked the flames in the first place? And could they have been prevented? Some theorize that the Eaton Fire in Pasadena was caused by wind-felled power lines, or that the Palisades Fire was seeded by the embers of a smaller fire the week before. But the list of possible culprits is long—even a car engine idling over dry grass can ignite a fire.\n“To jump to any conclusions right now is speculation,” said Ginger Colbrun, a spokesperson for the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the lead agency investigating the cause of the Palisades Fire, to the Los Angeles Times. Figuring it out will likely take months. It took the bureau more than a year to conclude that the fire in August 2023 that devastated Lahaina, Maui, which was similarly lashed by high winds, was started by broken power lines.\nEven given enough time, the causes of the Los Angeles fires might remain a mystery. According to a recent study, authorities never find the source of ignition for more than half of all of wildfires in the Western US—a knowledge gap that can hamper prevention efforts even as climate change ramps up the frequency of these deadly events. If authorities can anticipate likely causes of a fire, they can help build more resilient neighborhoods and educate the public on how to avoid the next deadly event.\n“Fire research is so incredibly difficult. It’s more difficult than looking for a needle in the haystack,” said Costas Synolakis, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies natural disasters. Synolakis said fires with especially high temperatures, such as those in Los Angeles, often obliterate the evidence. “That’s why it’s so challenging to mitigate fire losses,” he said. “You just don’t know what triggers them.”\nThe US Forest Service is teaming up with computer scientists to see if artificial intelligence can help crack old cases. A study led by data scientists at Boise State University, published in the journal Earth’s Future earlier this month, analyzed the conditions surrounding more than 150,000 unsolved wildfire cases from 1992 to 2020 in Western states and found that 80 percent of wildfires were likely caused by people (whether accidentally or intentionally), with lightning responsible for just 20 percent. According to Cal Fire, people have caused 95 percent of California’s wildfires.\nKaren Short, a research ecologist with the Forest Service who contributed to the study and maintains a historical database of national wildfire reports, says understanding why they start is essential for preventing them and educating the public. Strategic prevention appears to work: According to the National Fire Protection Association, house fires in the US have decreased by nearly half since the 1980s.\nIn 2024, Short expanded her wildfire archive to include more information useful to investigators, such as weather, elevation, population density, and a fire’s timing. “We need to have those things captured in the data to track them over time. We still track things from the 1900s,” she said.\nAccording to Short, wildfire trends across the western United States have shifted with human activity. In recent decades, ignitions from power lines, fireworks, and firearms have become more common, in contrast with the railroad- and sawmill-caused fires that were once more common.\nThe study found that vehicles and equipment are likely the number one culprit, potentially causing 21 percent of wildfires without a known cause since 1992. Last fall, the Airport Fire in California was just such an event, burning over 23,000 acres. And an increasing number of fires are the result of arson and accidental ignition—whether from smoking, gunfire, or campfires—that make up another 18 percent. In 2017, an Arizona couple’s choice of a blue smoke-spewing firework for a baby gender reveal party lit the Sawmill Fire, torching close to 47,000 acres.\nBut these results aren’t definitive. Machine-learning models such as those used for the study are trained to predict the likelihood of a given fire’s cause, rather than prove that a particular ignition happened. Although the study’s model showed 90 percent accuracy selecting between lightning or human activity as the ignition source when tested on fires with known causes, it had more difficulty determining exactly which of 11 possible human behaviors were to blame, only getting it right half the time.\nYavar Pourmohamad, a data science PhD researcher at Boise State University who led the study, says that knowing the probable causes of a fire could help authorities warn people in high-risk areas before a blaze actually starts. “It could give people a hint of what is most important to be careful of,” he said. “Maybe in the future, AI can become a trustworthy tool for real-world action.”\nSynolakis, the USC professor, says Pourmohamad and Short’s research is important for understanding how risks are changing. He advocates for proactive actions like burying power lines underground where they can’t be buffeted by winds.\nA 2018 study found that fires set off by downed power lines—such as the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, that same year—have been increasing. Although the authors note that while power lines do not account for many fires, they’re associated with larger swaths of burned land.\n“We have to really make sure that our communities are more resilient to climate change,” Synolakis said. “As we’re seeing with the extreme conditions in Los Angeles, fire suppression alone doesn’t do it.”",

    "content_text": "This week started off with a bang and just kept going. In the wee hours of Saturday night, TikTok cut off access to users in the United States ahead of Sunday’s deadline that forced Apple and Google to remove the video-sharing app from their app stores. While TikTok was dark, US users raced to get around the TikTok ban while several other unexpected apps saw their access to Americans severed as well. By midday on Sunday, however, TikTok access was already coming back in the US. By Monday night, newly inaugurated US president Donald Trump had signed an executive order delaying the TikTok ban by 75 days.\nOn Tuesday, Trump made good on his promise to free Ross Ulbricht, the imprisoned creator of the Silk Road dark-web market, where users sold drugs, guns, and worse. Ulbricht had spent more than 11 years behind bars after he was arrested by the FBI in 2013 and later sentenced to life in prison. Trump’s decision to pardon Ulbricht is largely seen as linked to the support he’s received from the libertarian cryptocurrency community, which has long considered the Silk Road creator a martyr.\nAs the world enters the second Trump era, WIRED sat down with Jen Easterly, who recently left her top spot as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to discuss the cyber threats facing the US and CISA’s uncertain future as the frontline watchdog against nation-state hackers and other digital security threats facing the US.\nLastly, we detailed new research that revealed how trivial bugs had exposed Subaru’s system for tracking the locations of its customers’ vehicles. The researchers found they could access a web portal for Subaru employees that allowed them to pinpoint up to a years’ worth of a car’s location—down to the parking spots they use. The flaws are now patched, but Subaru employees still have access to sensitive driver location data.\nThat’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\nJudge Says Controversial FBI Searches Require a Warrant\nA US judge in New York this week found that the FBI’s practice of searching data on US persons under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act without obtaining a warrant is unconstitutional. FISA gives the US government the authority to collect the communications of foreign entities through internet providers and companies like Apple and Google. Once this data was collected, the FBI could perform “backdoor searches” for information on US citizens or residents who communicated with foreigners, and it did so without first obtaining a warrant. Judge DeArcy Hall found that these searches do require a warrant. “To hold otherwise would effectively allow law enforcement to amass a repository of communications under Section 702—including those of US persons—that can later be searched on demand without limitation,” the judge wrote.\nCloudflare Function Could Expose App Users’ Rough Location\nAn “issue” with the basic functionality of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare’s content delivery network, or CDN, can reveal the coarse location of people using apps, including those meant for protecting privacy, according to findings from an independent security researcher. Cloudflare has servers in hundreds of cities and more than 100 countries around the world. Its CDN works by caching peoples’ internet traffic across its servers then delivering that data from the server closest to a person’s location. The security researcher, who goes by Daniel, found a way to send an image to a target, collect the URL, then use a custom-built tool to query Cloudflare to find out which data center delivered the image—and thus the state or possibly the city the target is in. Fortunately, Cloudflare tells 404 Media that it fixed the issue after Daniel reported it.\nTrump Administration Disbands Review Board Investigating China’s Salt Typhoon Attacks\nIn one of its first moves after Trump took office on Monday, the Department of Homeland Security let go everyone on the agency’s advisory committees. This includes the Cyber Safety Review Board, which was investigating widespread attacks on the US telecommunications system by the China-backed hacker group Salt Typhoon. US authorities revealed in mid-November that Salt Typhoon had embedded itself in at least nine US telecoms for espionage purposes, potentially exposing anyone using unencrypted calls and text message to surveillance by Beijing. While the future of the CSRB remains uncertain, sources tell reporter Eric Geller that their investigation into Salt Typhoon’s attacks is effectively “dead.”",

FISA gives the US government the authority to collect the communications of foreign entities through internet providers and companies like Apple and Google. Once this data was collected, the FBI could perform “backdoor searches” for information on US citizens or residents who communicated with foreigners, and it did so without first obtaining a warrant. Judge DeArcy Hall found that these searches do require a warrant. “To hold otherwise would effectively allow law enforcement to amass a repository of communications under Section 702—including those of US persons—that can later be searched on demand without limitation,” the judge wrote.</p><p class=\"paywall\">An “issue” with the basic functionality of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare’s content delivery network, or CDN, can reveal the coarse location of people using apps, including those meant for protecting privacy, according to findings from an independent security researcher. Cloudflare has servers in hundreds of cities and more than 100 countries around the world. Its CDN works by caching peoples’ internet traffic across its servers then delivering that data from the server closest to a person’s location. The security researcher, who goes by Daniel, found a way to send an image to a target, collect the URL, then use a custom-built tool to query Cloudflare to find out which data center delivered the image—and thus the state or possibly the city the target is in. Fortunately, Cloudflare tells 404 Media that it fixed the issue after Daniel reported it.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In one of its first moves after Trump took office on Monday, the Department of Homeland Security let go everyone on the agency’s advisory committees.

    "content_text": "When Taylor Swift started dating Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs in September 2023, sports betting fans were less than enthused.\nRobert Cooper, BetOnline.ag sportsbook director, remembers the reaction from pitching early Swift-themed prop bets, novelty wagers that don’t affect a game’s outcome or take place outside the game entirely, to football media. “Don't send me this S-H-I-T,” he recalls them saying. “Send me football top 10 [betting odds] and that's it.”\nBut Swift’s appearances at Chiefs games over the next several months generated an estimated $331.5 million in brand value for the team and the NFL. She was credited with ratcheting up viewership ratings, particularly among women, in the 2023-24 NFL season, and spurring a flood of press coverage and merchandise sales in the process. By the time the Chiefs faced the San Francisco 49ers in the 2024 Super Bowl, there was another love story at play. Swift had been mainstreamed in the multibillion-dollar sports betting industry, was mentioned on betting podcasts, integrated into sportsbook social media promotions, and inspired prop bets on which millions of dollars have since been wagered worldwide.\nThe way the sports betting industry has leveraged Swift’s fame is indicative of a larger reframing of the public’s relationship with online gambling. By extending it beyond the world of sports and tying prop bets and social media promotions into larger news cycles, companies like FanDuel and DraftKings can attract new audiences from not just Swifties but a wide range of fandoms.\nBetMGM memorably announced that the “Taylor Swift effect” led to a 51 percent increase in women betting. (The company didn’t share the betting figures that this increase is based on, or respond to questions from WIRED.)\nThat spike could be attributed at least in part to Swifties being able to wager on the Super Bowl using prepackaged sets named after their favorite Taylor Swift song titles. Other Swiftie prop bets were even more populist. BetOnline.ag offered bettors 89 Taylor Swift–themed prop bets for last year’s Super Bowl, including the primary color of her top at the Super Bowl and whether her screen time would exceed 28.5 seconds. (While offering prop bets directly on Swift’s actions is widely prohibited in the US, BetOnline.ag is licensed in Panama.)\nBut with the 2024-25 NFL season winding down, and the Chiefs facing off against the Buffalo Bills in the American Football Conference championship game this weekend, the Taylor Swift effect appears to be blunted.\nPublic relations representative for BetOnline.ag, Josh Barton notes that last year Swift “would be shown double-digit times on TV,” but this year her onscreen presence was diminished. Despite attending at least one game in person every month this season while finishing her Eras world tour, she’s attended fewer than in 2023-24.\nThat appears to have made an impact on betting volume. Ahead of the Chiefs’ September 24, 2023, game, when bets on the Chiefs at FanDuel increased by 247 percent, compared to the team's game the previous week. “They were rooting for him to score a touchdown, in large part because they wanted to see her celebrate in the box,” says Chris Jones, vice president of communications at FanDuel. The handle, or money wagered on these bets, increased by 533 percent over the prior week. A more typical increase might be 20 or 30 percent, he adds.\nIt’s hard to quantify the Swiftie demographic’s impact on these bets, but preseason, WIRED reached out to several sportsbooks including BetRivers, DraftKings, FanDuel and Rivalry, which said the Taylor Swift effect was real, and expected it would continue to affect their industry this season.\nTim Whitehead, sportsbook head at BetRivers, put it succinctly. “So long as the world’s biggest pop star is still dating one of the NFL’s most popular players, we’ll tap into that narrative to attract new audiences,” he told WIRED in a statement. But even early in the year, despite Kelce still attracting strong wagers, the outsized Swift effect seemed to have worn off. FanDuel noted that in two early games, neither attended by Swift, teammates of Kelce’s garnered similar betting levels to him. This month, a FanDuel spokesperson told WIRED that interest in betting on Kelce “has leveled out to be in line with the other playmakers on the Chiefs.”\nMichael Naraine, an associate professor of sport management at Brock University in Canada, attributes this to the US election dominating news and prop betting cycles, along with less attention-grabbing headlines in the couple’s relationship as they settled into their partnership. “The T. Swift effect does still exist, it just has been muted over the last year,” he says. “It's not as topical, it's not as high a momentum, but it's still valuable to the books.”\nA study from the University of Queensland in Australia published in December found nearly 90 percent of the country’s regular sports bettors are male, and suggested that this was due, at least partially, to physical betting spaces being “male-dominated” over history, though smartphones make gambling more accessible to female audiences. This pattern holds in other countries, like the US, where only 28 percent of current sports bettors of 2,000 surveyed were women according to a two-week poll by YouGov last year. “It is unsurprising that betting companies are attempting to capitalise on this shift, targeting women with novelty bets like how many awards Taylor Swift will win at this year’s Grammy’s,” author Rohann Irving said in a release about the study.\nDespite the outsize attention Swift’s received from online sportsbooks since dating Kelce, she is only one character in a chorus in the new wave of narrative betting that has risen alongside the industry. In the past, betting narratives which struck chords with bettors focused on underdog or champion players and teams. Today the tales spun have expanded to include a wide array of competitions, from the Oscars, to the US presidential election, to reality TV shows.\nJones, from FanDuel, says ardent sports gamblers give little shrift to this trend. “They’re looking at defensive matchups, offensive matchups, weather, historical data; they’re not caring who the guy’s dating,” he says. But many recreational bettors—whom Jones says make up “an overwhelming majority” of FanDuel’s customer base—seek out narratives like the Swift-Kelce romance when wagering.\nJoshua Grubbs, an associate professor in the University of New Mexico’s department of psychology who has researched sports betting behaviors, says over email that sportsbooks “are absolutely trying to convert a group of people who are not betting into bettors.” But whether a Swift-based strategy differs from the industry’s usual marketing is less clear. “I don't know that having Taylor Swift prop bets is any more pernicious than any other set of prop bets, free bet promos, or other gimmicks they offer,” he says.\nFor Grubbs, it’s instead a broader question of the appropriateness of gambling advertising, an unsettled debate which includes whether sportsbooks should be promoted on television or allowed to sponsor sports teams.\n“At the end of the day, we’re content creators,” says Cooper of BetOnline.ag, noting that the more “click-baity” the content, the better. “When we see a storyline or something that’s trending, we’re going to lean into that and try to distribute to a broader audience.”\nThe industry representatives I spoke with were hopeful about a turnaround should Swift get engaged or have a child with Kelce. “If Taylor Swift ever did a Super Bowl halftime show and the Chiefs were in it, that would break the entire world, internet, everything,” Cooper says.",

    "content_text": "On January 20, DeepSeek, a relatively unknown AI research lab from China, released an open source model that’s quickly become the talk of the town in Silicon Valley. According to a paper authored by the company, DeepSeek-R1 beats the industry’s leading models like OpenAI o1 on several math and reasoning benchmarks. In fact, on many metrics that matter—capability, cost, openness—DeepSeek is giving Western AI giants a run for their money.\nDeepSeek’s success points to an unintended outcome of the tech cold war between the US and China. US export controls have severely curtailed the ability of Chinese tech firms to compete on AI in the Western way—that is, infinitely scaling up by buying more chips and training for a longer period of time. As a result, most Chinese companies have focused on downstream applications rather than building their own models. But with its latest release, DeepSeek proves that there’s another way to win: by revamping the foundational structure of AI models and using limited resources more efficiently.\n“Unlike many Chinese AI firms that rely heavily on access to advanced hardware, DeepSeek has focused on maximizing software-driven resource optimization,” explains Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, who studies Chinese innovations. “DeepSeek has embraced open source methods, pooling collective expertise and fostering collaborative innovation. This approach not only mitigates resource constraints but also accelerates the development of cutting-edge technologies, setting DeepSeek apart from more insular competitors.”\nSo who is behind the AI startup? And why are they suddenly releasing an industry-leading model and giving it away for free? WIRED talked to experts on China’s AI industry and read detailed interviews with DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng to piece together the story behind the firm’s meteoric rise. DeepSeek did not respond to several inquiries sent by WIRED.\nA Star Hedge Fund in China\nEven within the Chinese AI industry, DeepSeek is an unconventional player. It started as Fire-Flyer, a deep-learning research branch of High-Flyer, one of China’s best-performing quantitative hedge funds. Founded in 2015, the hedge fund quickly rose to prominence in China, becoming the first quant hedge fund to raise over 100 billion RMB (around $15 billion). (Since 2021, the number has dipped to around $8 billion, though High-Flyer remains one of the most important quant hedge funds in the country.)\nFor years, High-Flyer had been stockpiling GPUs and building Fire-Flyer supercomputers to analyze financial data. Then, in 2023, Liang, who has a master's degree in computer science, decided to pour the fund’s resources into a new company called DeepSeek that would build its own cutting-edge models—and hopefully develop artificial general intelligence. It was as if Jane Street had decided to become an AI startup and burn its cash on scientific research.\nBold vision. But somehow, it worked. “DeepSeek represents a new generation of Chinese tech companies that prioritize long-term technological advancement over quick commercialization,” says Zhang.\nLiang told the Chinese tech publication 36Kr that the decision was driven by scientific curiosity rather than a desire to turn a profit. “I wouldn’t be able to find a commercial reason [for founding DeepSeek] even if you ask me to,” he explained. “Because it’s not worth it commercially. Basic science research has a very low return-on-investment ratio. When OpenAI’s early investors gave it money, they sure weren’t thinking about how much return they would get. Rather, it was that they really wanted to do this thing.”\nToday, DeepSeek is one of the only leading AI firms in China that doesn’t rely on funding from tech giants like Baidu, Alibaba, or ByteDance.\nA Young Group of Geniuses Eager to Prove Themselves\nAccording to Liang, when he put together DeepSeek’s research team, he was not looking for experienced engineers to build a consumer-facing product. Instead, he focused on PhD students from China’s top universities, including Peking University and Tsinghua University, who were eager to prove themselves. Many had been published in top journals and won awards at international academic conferences, but lacked industry experience, according to the Chinese tech publication QBitAI.\n“Our core technical positions are mostly filled by people who graduated this year or in the past one or two years,” Liang told 36Kr in 2023. The hiring strategy helped create a collaborative company culture where people were free to use ample computing resources to pursue unorthodox research projects. It’s a starkly different way of operating from established internet companies in China, where teams are often competing for resources. (A recent example: ByteDance accused a former intern—a prestigious academic award winner, no less—of sabotaging his colleagues’ work in order to hoard more computing resources for his team.)\nLiang said that students can be a better fit for high-investment, low-profit research. “Most people, when they are young, can devote themselves completely to a mission without utilitarian considerations,” he explained. His pitch to prospective hires is that DeepSeek was created to “solve the hardest questions in the world.”\nThe fact that these young researchers are almost entirely educated in China adds to their drive, experts say. “This younger generation also embodies a sense of patriotism, particularly as they navigate US restrictions and choke points in critical hardware and software technologies,” explains Zhang. “Their determination to overcome these barriers reflects not only personal ambition but also a broader commitment to advancing China’s position as a global innovation leader.”\nInnovation Born out of a Crisis\nIn October 2022, the US government started putting together export controls that severely restricted Chinese AI companies from accessing cutting-edge chips like Nvidia’s H100. The move presented a problem for DeepSeek. The firm had started out with a stockpile of 10,000 A100’s, but it needed more to compete with firms like OpenAI and Meta. “The problem we are facing has never been funding, but the export control on advanced chips,” Liang told 36Kr in a second interview in 2024.\nDeepSeek had to come up with more efficient methods to train its models. “They optimized their model architecture using a battery of engineering tricks—custom communication schemes between chips, reducing the size of fields to save memory, and innovative use of the mix-of-models approach,” says Wendy Chang, a software engineer turned policy analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. “Many of these approaches aren’t new ideas, but combining them successfully to produce a cutting-edge model is a remarkable feat.”\nDeepSeek has also made significant progress on Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts, two technical designs that make DeepSeek models more cost-effective by requiring fewer computing resources to train. In fact, DeepSeek's latest model is so efficient that it required one-tenth the computing power of Meta's comparable Llama 3.1 model to train, according to the research institution Epoch AI.\nDeepSeek’s willingness to share these innovations with the public has earned it considerable goodwill within the global AI research community. For many Chinese AI companies, developing open source models is the only way to play catch-up with their Western counterparts, because it attracts more users and contributors, which in turn help the models grow. “They’ve now demonstrated that cutting-edge models can be built using less, though still a lot of, money and that the current norms of model-building leave plenty of room for optimization,” Chang says. “We are sure to see a lot more attempts in this direction going forward.”\nThe news could spell trouble for the current US export controls that focus on creating computing resource bottlenecks. “Existing estimates of how much AI computing power China has, and what they can achieve with it, could be upended,” Chang says.\nCorrection 1/27/24 2:08pm ET: An earlier version of this story said DeepSeek has reportedly has a stockpile of 10,000 H100 Nvidia chips. It has been updated to clarify the stockpile is believed to be A100 chips.",

Well, for one thing, your cholesterol levels could reach such stratospheric levels that lipids start oozing from your blood vessels, forming yellowish nodules on your skin.\nThat was the disturbing case of a man in Florida who showed up at a Tampa hospital with a three-week history of painless, yellow eruptions on the palms of his hands, soles of his feet, and elbows. His case was published today in JAMA Cardiology.\nThe man, said to be in his forties, told doctors that he had adopted a “carnivore diet” eight months prior.

    "content_text": "As one of his first acts after being sworn in, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing the Department of Government Efficiency by reorganizing and renaming an existing entity, the US Digital Services (USDS), as the US DOGE Service. And while some have noted that this version of DOGE moves away from the sweeping vision of deregulation outlined in a November Wall Street Journal op-ed, it's a move that will give centibillionaire Elon Musk and his allies seemingly unprecedented insight across the government and access to troves of federal data.\n“It’s quite a clever way of integrating DOGE into the federal government that I think will work, in the sense of giving it a platform for surveillance and recommendations,” says Richard Pierce, a law professor at George Washington University.\nSoon after his election victory, Trump announced that he would form DOGE, led by Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, to provide “advice and guidance from outside the government”—something that would generally require it be formed as a federal advisory committee. The idea was that DOGE would provide recommendations for how to cut some $2 trillion from the federal budget. (Shortly before Trump’s inauguration, Ramaswamy exited the DOGE project.)\nBoth Ramaswamy and Musk supported Trump during his campaign, but Musk emerged as one of the president’s most important financial backers, donating close to $200 million to the Trump-supporting America PAC. Additionally, he used the power of his own celebrity to drum up support for Trump both online and off, joining the president on the campaign trail and amplifying Trump's messaging on X, the social media platform he owns. Almost immediately after the election, Musk began to take a central role in the transition, joining Trump on calls with foreign leaders and making staffing recommendations.\nMeanwhile, Musk put out a call for people to work with DOGE onlin, and turned the Washington, DC office of his company SpaceX into a staging ground for the entity while bringing in other major figures from Silicon Valley to assist in the effort. Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen apparently joined the effort as a self-proclaimed “unpaid intern.”\nBut under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, committees of the sort DOGE seemed to be shaping up to be have several legal requirements, including making all meetings publicly accessible and requiring a diversity of perspectives on the committee itself. By repurposing the USDS, which was already part of the Office of Management and Budget, Trump managed to skirt both the requirements of a formal advisory committee and the congressional oversight required when creating a new federal agency. In short, it meant DOGE would get more access to sensitive data than an advisory committee would likely have, while offering less transparency.\nThe USDS was created by former president Barack Obama to untangle dysfunctional or failing technology across the federal government in the wake of the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. The Service’s mandate allows it the wide-ranging ability to enter any government agency and access its software or technical systems with the goal of helping to streamline or reform existing systems.\nUnder the executive order, DOGE teams, which “will typically include one DOGE Team Lead, one engineer, one human resources specialist, and one attorney” will be dispatched to various agencies. They will be granted “access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems,” ostensibly with the goal of streamlining data sharing across federal agencies.\nA former USDS employee who spoke to WIRED who was granted anonymity to preserve their privacy called the repurposing of the Digital Service an “A+ bureaucratic jiujitsu move.” But, they say, they’re concerned that DOGE’s access to sensitive information could be used to do more than just streamline government operations.\n“Is this technical talent going to be pointed toward using data from the federal government to track down opponents?” they ask. “To track down particular populations of interest to this administration for the purposes of either targeting them or singling them out or whatever it might end up being?”\nAre you a current or former employee with the US Digital Services or another government agency impacted by DOGE? We’d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Vittoria Elliott at vittoria_elliott@wired.com or securely at velliott88.18 on Signal.\nIt appears, however, that the first order of DOGE is to weed out people in agencies that might push back on the Trump administration’s agenda, starting with existing USDS staff, and hire new people.\n“DOGE teams have a lawyer, an HR director, and an engineer. If you were looking to identify functions to cut, people to cut, having an HR director there and having a lawyer say ‘here's what we're allowed to do or not do’ would be one way that you would facilitate that,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, noting that DOGE’s potential access to federal employee data could put “them in some sort of crosshairs to be fired.”\nWhen Musk took over Twitter, he brought in outside help from his close circle as well as his other companies to transform the company, a move he appears to be repeating.\nWho exactly is going to be part of DOGE is a particularly thorny issue, because there are technically two DOGEs. One is the permanent organization, the revamped USDS—now the US DOGE Service. The other is a temporary organization, with a termination date of July 4, 2026. Creating this organization means the temporary DOGE can operate under a special set of rules. It can sequester employees from other parts of the government and can accept people who want to work for the government as volunteers. Temporary organizations can also hire what are known as special government employees—experts in a given field who can bypass the rigors of the regular federal hiring processes. They’re also not subject to the same transparency requirements as other government employees.\nIn the best-case scenario, this would allow DOGE to move quickly to address issues and fast-track necessary talent, as well as build systems that make government services more seamless by facilitating the flow of information and data. But in the worst case, this could mean less transparency around the interests of people working on important government projects, while enabling possible surveillance.\n“I think part of the reason they're wanting to use special government employees is because so long as they all work less than 60 days, the financial reporting requirements are less, which is going to be attractive to billionaires who have a lot of financial things they don't want to disclose,” says Nick Bednar, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Law. “And with agency approval, these individuals are allowed to continue contracting with the federal government if they represent, say, a corporation that has a lot of contracts with the government.”\nMusk alone has over received billions of dollars via contracts with the federal government through his company SpaceX.\n“To me, [the temporary organization] suggests there's some sort of, there's some reason for that which probably has to do with skirting disclosure and conflicts of interest requirements,” claims Moynihan.\nNoah Kunin, former infrastructure director at the US General Services Administration, tells WIRED that “the government has access to incredible amounts of sensitive or proprietary business information that [businesses] had to share with the government in order to get a contract or take some action.” And while not everyone gets to access this—it generally requires some form of clearance, and government employees are not supposed to share it—this kind of information could be particularly useful to someone like Musk or other members of the business community who might be brought into DOGE.\n“You always have concerns whenever you have private sector individuals entering government for a temporary position,” says Bednar. “This is how regulatory capture occurs.”\nEven with all these special maneuvers, DOGE will likely still face hurdles. Sharing data across government departments and systems is tricky, particularly when different laws govern different agencies and the information they collect. Similarly, sensitive data often requires some form of government authorization, which DOGE volunteers and employees might not be able to get.\n“There are legal restrictions to sharing data between organizations, and those agreements take an enormous amount of effort to put into place,” the former USDS employee says. “There are tons of examples of obstacles to information sharing like that. So maybe this is more aspirational than it is possible.”\n“DOGE has just sort of added this element of unpredictability to what happens next in government,” says Moynihan. “It could be a bipartisan effort to make government technology work better. It could be an oligarch extracting resources from the government. We just really don't know. We're all gazing at tea leaves right now.”\nUpdated 1/24/2024, 12:26 pm EST: This story has been updated to reflect the reasons why a source was granted anonymity.",

    "content_text": "Just before the presidential election last November, Carolyn Fisher was in her living room in Birmingham, Alabama, when her nonbinary child walked in and said that he, along with four other transgender kids, were planning on dying by suicide if Donald Trump won the upcoming election.\nFisher and her husband were both lifelong Republicans and supporters of Trump. Holding a spiral notebook, Carolyn’s 16-year-old, who uses the pronouns he and they, made a case against voting for Trump.\n“He laid out why a vote for Donald Trump was voting against him as our child and why Donald Trump should never be president. He had literally been keeping notes of everything Trump and other Republicans had been saying about trans and nonbinary people, how they were mentally delusional and mentally ill. When he laid all of that out, my husband and I, we both just looked at each other and started crying.”\nFisher, together with members of the Rainbow Youth Project, contacted the parents of the other children who were part of the pact.\nThe Fishers later voted for then-vice president Kamala Harris, even going so far as taking a picture of their ballot to show their child.\nBut Trump still won, and during the president’s inauguration speech on January 20, the Fishers heard him say that their child effectively doesn’t exist when he signed a sweeping executive order that, among other things, calls for the ending of trans care, requires housing trans women in male prisons, and allows only male or female markers on official documents like passports and not the “X” that was introduced in 2021 for people who identify as nonbinary, intersex, or gender nonconforming.\n“As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female,” Trump said.\nWhen a bishop at the National Cathedral service for the inauguration this week asked Trump to protect “gay, lesbian, and transgender children” the president dismissed her pleas in a Truth Social post and called her “nasty in tone, and not compelling or smart.”\nThe executive order contains provisions that require further federal action to become law, and this document should be viewed as a roadmap the Trump administration has drafted to signal what new rules they are planning on implementing. But experts say the order published this week, in conjunction with Trump’s very public comments, are designed to strike fear into the trans community.\n“I think there's a huge amount of it that is just about fear, and a part of it is trying to scare people into compliance” Allison Chapman, a trans rights activist, tells WIRED. “Enforcement takes a lot of time, energy, and resources, so what we really need people to do is to not voluntarily comply in advance. There needs to be an active resistance to these things.”\nThe Rainbow Youth Project, an organization focused on helping young LGBTQ+ people, received over 6,000 calls in just the first couple of days after Trump’s November election win. That’s up from the usual 3,600 calls a month. It didn’t stop: The hotline received over 8,000 calls in December.\nNow, after Trump’s comment and actions on the first day of his presidency, the group’s crisis helpline is once again receiving a torrent of calls. Sixty-two percent of incoming calls this week, the group tells WIRED, are from trans and gender-nonconforming adolescents age 14 to 17.\nThe callers are expressing varying degrees of emotional and mental distress, often expressing feelings of hopelessness and fear. One of the most common sentiments shared is “my country does not want me to exist.”\nWhile the Trump administration’s actions are causing huge distress for the trans community and their families, a stark increase in the attacks, both online and offline, are already coming from Trump supporters who feel emboldened.\n“We have already seen an uptick in the hate against us,” Fisher says. “We had someone who came to our home just last Tuesday and put a note in our mailbox that said: ‘He's your daddy now, he's your president. You people won't exist anymore.’ So yes, they're definitely emboldened.”\nA trans pride flag they had hanging on their porch has been stolen twice in the space of a week. At her local Piggly Wiggly, a supermarket, she overheard people at an adjacent table talking about how glad they were that Trump had “gotten rid of” trans people.\n“He didn’t get rid of them, they’re always going to exist—but he damn so put a target on them, especially my teenage son,” Fisher said.\nAnd the attacks are also targeting the groups who are trying to help the LGBTQ+ community.\n“We have seen a lot more hate,” Lance Preston, executive director of the Rainbow Youth Project, tells WIRED. “We've been receiving a lot of messages, crazy shit, like ‘Trump is your president, now all of you are gonna have to go away. We don't want you here.’ We get those in contact submission forms every day, and since the election it has just grown exponentially. It's really sad.”\nSome activists are also concerned that those who have always stood with the LGBTQ+ community could be too scared to speak up under Trump’s new administration.\n“Every time something like this happens we notice supporters backing down and just getting quiet,” Chris Sederburg, who helps trans and gender nonconforming people through the Rainbow Youth Project, tells WIRED. “Not all of them, but a lot of them do because they're scared of what's happening. They're scared of what might happen to them or they might catch hate for it.”\nSederburg, a trans man who works as a trucker, communicates with young trans people on social media and says that the response this week from the community has been one of “intense, immediate fear.”\nFor Jamie Anderson, a 40-year-old teacher living in Texas, her biggest fear is that Trump’s administration forces her 15-year-old daughter Dawn, who came out as trans last year, to make a traumatic decision.\n“My biggest worry is that she's going to have to go back to living a lie, like not being who she is meant to be,” says Anderson. “She's happy now, she's a lot happier than she was right before she came out. She was super depressed. We had no idea what was going on. And finally she comes out, and she's this whole brand-new, amazing, loving child.”\nBut that’s not Dawn’s biggest fear. When WIRED asked what that would be, Dawn remained silent. Moments after the interview, Dawn sent a message: “I am afraid the government will take me away and end up killing me because I am transgender,” adding that she was now willing to share this in case “it might help others understand what I’m going through.”\n(Jamie and Dawn are not the women’s real names. WIRED is using pseudonyms to protect their identities.)\nThe Fishers, meanwhile, are considering moving to a different state, possibly to California, where they feel their child would be more protected. But Carolyn Fisher worries about other families and trans and nonbinary children who may not have that option.\n“I just want these kids to know that there are people out there, even Republicans, even conservative Christians, who love them and accept them for the way they are, and we want them to stay here with us,” Fisher says.\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for free, 24-hour support from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

    "content_text": "All the tech we rely on, from cars to smartphones, was engineered using physics. You don’t need to know the science to use these things. But a well-rounded human should understand at least some of the key concepts—along with some music, art, history, and economics. Robert Heinlein said it all in Time Enough for Love:\n“A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.”\nSo, in the interest of not being insects, here are my top-five physics equations you should know.\nI’m sure you've seen this one before—it’s over 300 years old, and it's popular for science memes and T-shirts. It says the net force on an object equals its mass (m) times acceleration (a). But what does that really mean? It's all about interactions—like when you kick a soccer ball or drop a water bottle on the floor.\nNewton's second law says we can describe these interactions with the concept of “force.” And what do forces do? The net force on an object changes the object’s motion. But wait! There's a bunch more cool stuff in this simple-looking equation.\nSee those arrows over F and a? That indicates variables that are vectors, meaning they contain more than one piece of information. For example, if someone asks you to “socially distance” yourself by 1 meter, where would you end up? Who knows? You could go 1 meter to the east or west or 39 degrees from north. The distance by itself isn't the full story; you also need to specify a direction. This is true for both the forces and the acceleration. Other quantities (like mass or temperature) don't have direction. We call those scalar values.\nNewton’s second law is super useful, but weirdly, people don’t seem to believe it. The common misconception is that a constant force makes an object move at a constant speed. What this equation says, rather, is that if you push on an object with a steady force, it will keep accelerating.\nWhy do people get this wrong? It’s because you almost never have just one force acting on an object. If you kept a steady pressure on your car’s gas pedal, and that was the only force on the car, believe me, you’d keep going faster and faster. But in reality, there’s wind drag pushing in the opposite direction, which partially offsets the force from your engine.\nBy using forces to describe interactions, we can do a bunch of awesome things—like model the motion of a basketball in the air, an accelerating drag racer, or even the motion of a binary star system.\nIf you take a long string and shake one end, you will create a disturbance. Guess what, with that simple shake you've made a wave pulse, which travels along the string. It's pretty cool and very easy to do. I’m in Louisiana, so naturally I used a string of Mardi Gras beads.\nDon’t let this one scare you—it’s a differential equation, which is calculus. But the idea is simple. If you picture a coordinate plane with a string laid out on the x-axis, it says the position of the string in the vertical (y) direction depends on both time (t) and the location of that part of the string (x).\nUsing this, we can model a pulse on a string to show that it moves with a velocity v. For actual real strings, this wave velocity depends on both the mass per length as well as the string tension. Here's a fun example of a wave on a massive string in case you want to see some more math.\nWhy should you care? Well, it turns out that waves are all around us. Light is an electromagnetic wave. Same for the radiation in your microwave oven and your Wi-Fi signal. Sound is a pressure wave in the air. You can also pluck a string with both ends fixed, causing the wave to bounce back and forth—this is called a “standing wave,” and it’s how people play guitar. Kind of a big deal.\nAs you will see shortly, we can even describe the behavior of super tiny things like electrons with a wave-ish equation.\nHeh. I’m cheating a little by including four equations as just one, but it’s a package deal. Maxwell's equations basically describe everything you need to know about the electric field (E) and the magnetic field (B) and how they’re related. The electric field is a way to describe interactions with electric charges (like electrons and protons), and the magnetic field describes what happens when those charges are moving (either in an atom or in an electric current).\nPretty much everything around you has something to do with the electric-magnetic interaction. When you push on a wall, why doesn’t your hand pass through it? After all, the wall is not a solid object, it’s made up of discrete atoms. It’s because of an electric interaction between the electrons in your hand and those in the wall, which repel each other. Then of course there are things like light bulbs, electric motors—oh, and computers.\nWait! There's something even more important about Maxwell's equations. You can use these to show that an oscillating electric field creates a changing magnetic field, and this changing magnetic field creates an electric field. Essentially, you can make a wave (with the wave equation) for electric and magnetic fields in the same way that a wave moves on a string. The speed of this electromagnetic wave (in a vacuum) would be 2.99 x 108 meters per second—which just happens to be the speed of light. So, light is indeed an electromagnetic wave. That's kind of a big deal.\nSchrödinger’s equation is the mathematical model at the heart of quantum mechanics. Although we can use Newton's second law to understand the behavior of a baseball or the moon orbiting the Earth, this doesn't work when we get to super small things like electrons and protons. It turns out that many of our ideas about motion just don’t work at the subatomic scale. Richard Feynman once said, “If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics.”\nThat said, let's take a quick look at the Schrödinger equation. The version above is called the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in one dimension. See the variable Ψ (psi)? This is called the wave function. It's a way to represent the probable location of a particle, since we can't actually calculate the trajectory. We call it a wave function because it has a wavelike solution—which is nice, since we can then use our math techniques for dealing with waves.\nNotice that this equation relates a time rate of change (on the left) and a space rate of change (on the right)—like the wave equation we explored earlier. It might seem weird that this includes an imaginary number (i is the square root of –1), but these often pop up in physics models—they’re quite useful to represent oscillations.\nLet's look at another awesome part of this equation: ℏ. This is called the reduced Planck constant, and it gives a relationship between energy and frequency at the quantum level. (For kicks, you can measure this fundamental constant using different colored LEDs.)\nNow, if you’re all in on quantum, and you want to tattoo Schrödinger's equation on your arm, I’d suggest using this shorter version:\nIt’s basically the same thing. You still have the dependence on time on the left. The space part is replaced with the Hamiltonian operator (an H wearing a hat). Finally, |Ψ> is called a state vector. It's just a different way to represent the wave function Ψ.\nOK, but why should you care about the quantum realm? Well, even though you can’t go there like Ant-Man, we often deal with things at the atomic level. Just think about a single water molecule. It's an interaction between one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. Even this simple molecule is very complicated, but it can be modeled using Schrödinger's equation. If you don't like water (you should), there's a whole range of technologies based on quantum mechanics: lasers, atomic clocks, LEDs, and of course semiconductors (used in the computer you’re reading this on).\nIf you ask any random person to give you a physics equation, there's a good chance you’ll get this one. In short, it shows a relationship between energy (E) and mass (m) with the constant c for the speed of light (2.99 x 108 meters per second) But wait! Although this version is what everybody knows, a more complete version looks like this:\nThis takes the particle's velocity (v) into account, so we can get an expression for the total energy of a particle. If the velocity is much lower than the speed of light, then the energy is approximately:\nThat 1/2mv2 might look familiar. It’s the kinetic energy of an object. So, we can say that the energy of something is the sum of its “rest mass energy” (mc2) and its kinetic energy.\nIt's crazy though. If you throw a baseball, it obviously has kinetic energy because it's moving. But Einstein’s equation says it also has energy when it’s stationary. Let’s look at some actual values. Suppose a baseball (mass of 0.149 kilograms) is moving with a speed of 40 meters per second (a professional pitcher speed). The ball would have a kinetic energy of 119 joules, but the rest mass energy would 1.33 x 1018 joules. You can tell that's big, right? But you have no idea.\nIn 2022 the US used 4.07 trillion kilowatt-hours of energy. If you convert that value, you get 1.46 x 1019 joules. So, if you were able to take 11 baseballs and convert all of their mass into electrical energy, it would be enough to run the US for a year.\nThis is exactly what happens in a nuclear power plant. Large-mass elements (like uranium) are hit with neutrons so that they break into pieces. However, the total mass of all the parts that it breaks into is less than the original uranium mass. The lost mass is converted to energy. Since the c term in the equation is squared, a little bit of mass gives a lot of energy.\nOh, maybe you don't like nuclear power plants. Fine. Do you like other types of energy? Do you like to eat? Do you like weather? All of these things depend on this large object in the sky called the sun. Yes, the sun produces light from a nuclear reaction in its core. This light is the source of most other forms of energy production. It helps plants grow (you can eat those), and animals eat those plants (you can also eat the animals). This solar energy heats the surface of the Earth to produce changes in temperature and weather. The sun is kind of a big deal.\nSo, perhaps E = mc2 may be the most famous physics equation, but it’s also the most important. I do like to eat stuff.\nDo you use these equations in your everyday life? Do you have a favorite formula not listed above? Tell us in the comments below.",

    "content_text": "Slowly but surely, we are making good on the gadgets we imagined, as kids, that the future would hold. Penny Brown’s video watch from Inspector Gadget? Check. The Starfleet tricorder from Star Trek? Almost there. But web-shooting? Web-slinging? That wasn't one we really thought would make the crossover. And it wasn't exactly in the plans for the scientist who has made the strong, sticky, air-spun web a reality either, Marco Lo Presti, from Tufts University’s Silklab.\nBack in 2020, Lo Presti, a research assistant professor in biomedical engineering, was working on the challenge of underwater adhesives. The first material he chose to work on was made up of silk and dopamine, a popular combination because it mimics the way that mussels stick firmly to rock surfaces in water—something that has been useful in other applications.\n“While using acetone to clean the glassware of this silk and dopamine substance,” he says, “I noticed it was undergoing a transition into a solid format, into a web-looking material, into something that looked like a fiber. I showed the vials to Fio, and we immediately started thinking about how we could make a remote adhesive [a substance that sticks to an object from a distance] out of it.”\nFio is Fiorenzo Omenetto, professor of engineering at Tufts and “puppeteer” of the Silklab. “We'd like to say that every experiment is painstakingly planned with equations and lots of forethought, but it's really about connection,” he says. “You explore and you play and you sort of connect the dots. Part of the play that is very underestimated is where you say ‘hey, wait a second, is this like a Spider-Man thing?’ And you brush it off at first, but a material that mimics superpowers is always a very, very good thing.”\nBefore Lo Presti could turn his attention to these accidental webs, though, he had to complete his paper on underwater adhesives using biomolecules, which he did in 2021. A lot of the Silklab’s work is “bio-inspired” by spiders and silkworms, mussels and barnacles, velvet worm slime, even tropical orchids—so working out whether this sticky web could become something useful might seem like an easy side-step for the team.\nHowever, Lo Presti points out that while the new material does mimic spider threads, “there is no spider able to eject, to shoot a stream of solution, which turns into a fiber and does the remote capturing of a distant object.” This was something new, for the real world at least.\nBut as the research paper in Advanced Functional Materials notes—enter fictional characters. In Stan Lee and Steve Ditko’s original 1960s comic books, starting with Amazing Fantasy #15, Peter Parker builds a “little device,” one fastened to each wrist and triggered by finger pressure, to produce strands of ejectable ‘spider webs.’ By the time of the mid-2000s Sam Raimi Spider-Man films, the web-shooting switched from a wrist-worn spinneret gadget to an organic part of his superhero transformation.\nFrom Science Fiction Into Reality\nAt the real-life lab in Medford, Massachusetts, the true web-slinging evolution began when Lo Presti and his colleagues shot a thin stream of their silk fibroin (Japanese silk moth cocoons, boiled down and broken into proteins) and dopamine combination through a needle. This was originally ejected straight into a “bath” of acetone, which triggers the substance's solidification into a hydrogel.\nThe team then decided to add this all-important acetone into the outer layer of a coaxial needle, surrounding the silk and dopamine in the inner needle layer to enable the liquid to shoot straight into the air. As the acetone evaporates mid-air, the dopamine speeds up the substance's solidifying process, creating sticky, strong, spun fibers by pulling water away from the silk—something that would usually take hours.\nWith the obvious pop culture inspiration in mind, this was a place the team worked hard to get to. “We were looking at doing something in air,” Lo Presti says, “so adapting and creating the engineering device, the study of the flow, the coaxial needle, to have the fiber ejected in the air—that was where we started to get truly excited.”\nThe team started to experiment with its strength, shooting fibers to capture and lift objects including a cocoon, a 2-gram stainless-steel bolt and a 5-gram wood block from 12 centimeters away. Bit by bit, they fine-tuned their solution with additional materials to change what it was capable of: a biopolymer named chitosan to give the fibers up to 200 times more tensile strength and a borate buffer to increase the adhesiveness to objects by 18 times.\n“We can now catch an object up to 30 or 35 centimeters away and lift an object of around 15 to 20 grams,” says Lo Presti. The silk fibers performed the best on cardboard and wood, both instantly and after 10 minutes, but also work on materials like plastic, glass, and metal. Testing real-world conditions, the researchers used the air-spun fibers to remotely pick up a small plastic lab tube floating on water, and a stainless-steel scalpel, partially buried in sand.\nSo, Spider-Man capabilities when? “Everybody wants to know if we're going to be able to swing from buildings,” says Omenetto with a wry smile. But we're not there yet—so far the Silklab team itself has speculated about some potential uses for the material: the retrieval of an object that’s lost underwater, perhaps, or a drone that captures something in a remote environment.\n“In principle, if you have the starting material and if you can control the parameters, the baseline material properties are such that you could do amazing things,” Omenetto explains. “I mean you could probably lift a very heavy object, but that’s one of the big questions—what can you lift? Can you remotely drag something? Silk is very, very strong, it’s very tough, it can lift incredible weights but this is silk in its natural form whether it’s from the spider or the silkworm. There is not a fundamental limit in these directions.”\nLo Presti is interested to hear from anyone who has read his paper and thinks they might be in need of a web-shooting silk fiber. A few months after he published his work on the underwater adhesive, a nonprofit emailed to ask if it could be used to tag sharks. “My first answer was absolutely not,” he says, “because the adhesive is too rigid and because sharks move. But I then tried to make something, and we’re still collaborating with them and working on this.”\nIt’s not unlikely, Lo Presti suggests, that the same could happen with this project and that the speed, distance, and strength of the object-capturing fibers could also be improved with more dedicated work from the team. These first “small” examples are to demonstrate the possibilities of the material, but improving and tailoring it for specific applications may be the key to uncovering its true potential.",

    "content_text": "Mere moments after his swearing in Monday, President Donald Trump made a proclamation to attendees of his inauguration: “It shall henceforth be the policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.” Trump then signed an executive order disparaging what the White House called “gender ideology” and claiming that a person’s sex is “not changeable and [is] grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.”\nTrump’s order, which was widely seen as an unscientific attempt to roll back the rights of transgender and gender-expansive people, also instructs federal agencies “to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder’s sex,” rather than their gender identity. It was one of 78 orders signed on Monday, some of which were part of Trump’s attempts to end Biden-era policies that “socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.”\nWhile the executive order only affects federal policy, the broader implications are vast. It’s only been a decade since Facebook’s “real name” policy made it hard for people to hold accounts under names different than the ones on their IDs. Facebook has since amended these guidelines, but as companies like Meta clear the way for users to claim trans people have “mental illness,” digital safe spaces for LGBTQ+ people seem to be dwindling. Except in one arena: dating apps.\nFollowing Trump’s executive order, Match Group and Feeld both told WIRED they have no intention of reversing course when it comes to the gender identity options offered on their respective platforms.\n“We are not making changes to our apps,” says a spokesperson for Match Group, which owns OkCupid, Tinder, Hinge, and several other dating platforms.\nIt remains to be seen how other tech companies will respond to the executive order. Some, like Meta, seemed to be making overtures to the incoming Trump administration before this week. Earlier this month, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company would end its third-party fact-checking program and transition to a Community Notes model, à la X.\nZuckerberg peddled the sudden reversal as a bid to scale up free speech across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads and allow for more political content. “We’re going to simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse,” Zuckerberg said in a video accompanying the announcement.\nShould online life become even less inclusive for LGBTQ+ people during Trump’s term, apps like OkCupid, Feeld, and Hinge could become digital havens, places to connect. “In a time when many of our civil rights are under threat, dating apps have the ability to serve as crucial spaces for gender, racial, and sexual inclusivity,” says Apryl Williams, a professor of communication and digital studies at the University of Michigan.\nOver a decade ago, in 2014, OkCupid expanded its gender options for users to include identifications such as transgender, pangender, intersex, agender, and genderqueer. It was among the first dating apps to capture an accurate picture of identity online, and the different ways it was evolving. Currently, Tinder provides an option for “beyond binary” and Hinge allows users to select “nonbinary” on their profiles.\nBumble, which offers 19 gender options for singles, declined to comment on this story.\nFeeld is also doubling down on user protections under the Trump administration, CEO Ana Kirova tells WIRED. As societal norms continue to evolve, Kirova wants the app to be a sanctuary for safety and authenticity. “We remain dedicated to nurturing an environment where everyone can be and express themselves authentically, respectfully, and without fear of discrimination, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation,” she says.\nThis week the Trump administration also began scrubbing the internet of gender identity websites, including the “Change sex identification” page on the Social Security Administration website and the Department of Labor’s page for reporting sexual and gender-based discrimination.\nIn spite of Gen Z ditching dating apps in favor of IRL hookups, user growth on Feeld has increased 30 percent year-over-year since 2022. In fact, 2024 was a record year for Big Dating, as waves of new users joined despite reports of app fatigue. As more people consider what brings them pleasure and happiness, or simply question the outdated constraints of sexual constructs, Kirova says that Feeld recognizes the inherent fluidity in its members.

    "content_text": "Donald Trump’s executive order designating cartels as terrorist organizations could give his administration greater power to impose economic sanctions, restrict travel, and potentially take military action abroad. On Monday, when signing the executive order in the Oval Office, Trump said that “Mexico probably won't be happy.” But this proposal is not new—in his first term as president, Trump tried to impose this designation but was eventually dissuaded by Mexican authorities, who pledged to cooperate with the United States to combat cartels.\nThe idea of designating cartels as terrorists is decades old. \"This began to be discussed in the 1980s, during Ronald Reagan's administration, when drug trafficking began to be associated with the threat to national security. Since then, both Democrats and Republicans have promoted the concept of 'narcoterrorism,'\" says Oswaldo Zavala, author of Drug Cartels Do Not Exist: Narcotrafficking in US and Mexican Culture.\nNow, the government of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has maintained that the bilateral relationship should be based on cooperation and not subordination, is obliged to treat the issue of migration and drug trafficking with caution. “Our relationship with the United States will be one of equals,” said Sheinbaum. She said she expects a dialog between the two countries to take place soon. \"We will enter into communication and we know that there will be an agreement on different issues … reaching agreements on migration issues, recognition of the work of Mexicans in the United States, drug trafficking, weapons that cross from the United States to Mexico, cultural issues and, of course, trade issues. Always as equals,\" said the president.\nMexico is one of the largest trading partners of the United States. Fracturing the relationship could have economic repercussions, including millions of US jobs.\nIn the order issued Monday, Trump specifically mentioned two criminal groups operating within the United States: the Venezuelan-born Aragua Train and the Salvadoran-born MS-13. Using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, his administration could implement additional measures to dismantle the financial networks of these organizations.\nThe narrative of US government extortion of the Mexican government has come from both Democrats and Republicans. One proponent of this idea was Hillary Clinton. “Clinton represented an interventionist stance. This approach is characterized by a hostile and militaristic view towards Latin America. In this context, Donald Trump appears to be continuing, in a more aggressive way, the already violent anti-drug policy of the United States. Over the decades, this policy has become progressively more violent and hostile. In the 1940s, military actions focused on eradicating crops such as marijuana and opium. However, in the 1980s, a more systematic fight against alleged criminal organizations began, and by the 1990s, a closer collaboration between the army and the police was consolidated, which led to an increasing militarization of public life in Mexico,\" says Zavala, who also holds a PhD in philosophy. “My concern is that the concept of narcoterrorism amplifies the power of pressure, blackmail and, ultimately, this notion could inaugurate a new era of political violence justified by this discourse,” he adds.\nCartels Could Turn Into Real Terrorist Organizations\nSupporters of the designation often point to violence against Americans as justification. But military action against the cartels could lead to more organized attacks against Americans, even within the United States. \"Drug cartels could easily become full-blown terrorist organizations,\" said Brian Michael Jenkins, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corporation.\nTrump's executive order could be turned against the United States. And the difference is that we have stopped talking about marijuana and heroin, gradually shifting to synthetic drugs, with fentanyl being the most serious public health case in recent times, with 70,000 people dying from the synthetic opioid in 2023.\n“The problem with fentanyl is its ease of trafficking: It has no smell, comes in small pills, and is extremely discreet. In addition, most of those who traffic fentanyl are Americans, as are most of the users. This creates a paradox typical of drug policy. While there is talk of Mexican narco-terrorists, studies conducted in the United States show that the main perpetrators of fentanyl trafficking and consumption are Americans,” Zavala says.\nThis raises fundamental questions. \"If they are going to designate traffickers as narco-terrorists, will they also include the Americans who are part of these networks? Because we are not just talking about the famous drug cartels, but also trafficking networks, money laundering, arms smuggling and other structures, many of which are incorporated in the United States. There is an enormous complexity in defining where a cartel begins and where it ends. There is a dispersion of actors, organizations and relationships on both sides of the border involved in drug trafficking. Therefore, to speak of narcoterrorism is to speak of something vague and imprecise. This term is not supported by concrete evidence; rather, its use is eminently political,\" argues Zavala.\nAccording to Zavala, the narrative allows figures like President Trump to use the concept of narcoterrorism as a tool of intimidation, threat and extortion towards the Mexican government. “Rather than describing realities, narcoterrorism is based on spectral notions, on political phantoms that are used to force Mexico to align with Washington's interests,” he says.\nAn Executive Order to Intervene Militarily in Mexico\nIntervening militarily in Mexican territory with selective incursions aimed at damaging the cartels is something that has been on the US radar screen for some time now. But analysts argue that it would be a shot in the foot for the Trump administration.\n\"By using the concept of narcoterrorism, the US government empowers itself to intervene militarily in Mexico. That is something very complicated, because intervening in that way would seriously damage the binational relationship, which is very delicate. It is almost inconceivable [the idea of military aggression],\" Zavala explains. \"I believe that in addition to the bravado, the Mexican government has generally been aligned because in the end our security policy has always been subordinated and violated; even subalternized by the United States.\"\nThis Wednesday, the president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said that the secretary of foreign affairs, Juan Ramón de la Fuente, had a telephone conversation with US secretary of state Marco Rubio. She did not provide details of the conversation, but said it was \"a very cordial conversation\" and they discussed “migration and security issues.” Rubio has said that he would prefer that any action, any decision taken from Washington have the consent, the collaboration of the Mexican government.\n“Cartels Do Not Exist”\nOswaldo Zavala (Ciudad Juarez, 1975) has specialized in Mexican narrative, and has an alternative vision of the narco phenomenon in Mexico. He believes that the image of the power of the cartels is exaggerated and sponsored by the State. The author of The Imaginary U.S.—Mexico Drug Wars: State Power, Organized Crime, and the Political History of Narconarratives (1975–2012), explains to WIRED that the war against drug trafficking is generally built on fantastical, contradictory and often absurd concepts, which gradually form an imaginary that presents drug trafficking in an alarmist manner.\n\"The US government has managed with great skill to create a long list of concepts, monsters and criminal actors that not only dominate the public debate in the United States, but also in Mexico. Thus, when Americans want it, one organization or another becomes the center of discussion. In the 1980s, for example, it was the Guadalajara Cartel, with figures such as Rafael Caro Quintero and Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo. In the 1990s, the central figure was El Chapo Guzman, and later, Amado Carrillo. Today, the conversation revolves around fentanyl and, above all, the Sinaloa Cartel,\" Zavala explains.\nZavala argues that the narratives used by the US government are ways of simplifying a complex problem, giving a common sense to the debate that would otherwise be much more complicated. \"If we take into account that a large part of drug consumption occurs in the United States, that there are organizations within that country that facilitate trafficking, launder money and, in many cases, are as or more dangerous than the Mexican ones, the discussion becomes much more complex for the Mexican panorama. What these narratives do, then, is to simplify the situation, presenting Mexico as the primary enemy of US security. In doing so, the US government can intervene not only mediatically but also politically, diplomatically, and even militarily in Mexico,\" he says.\n“As citizens we must be very careful with the narratives that are generated from Washington,” he warns. \"It is essential to learn to analyze them critically and to distance ourselves from what we are being told. This process is neither easy nor quick, since, unfortunately, not only the Mexican government repeats these narratives, but the media also replicates them, and sometimes institutions and other actors push them. And, to complicate things even more, a popular culture is created that feeds these ideas: today there are already corridos about fentanyl, about the ‘Chapitos’ and about the supposed criminal empires of the cartels. It is very difficult to escape from all this.\"\nA War That Has Left More Than 100,000 People Missing\nMore than 100,000 people have been missing in Mexico since 1964, when the count began. The National Registry of Disappeared and Unaccounted for Persons has for months now exceeded this figure, which is evidence of the grave situation in the country. Most of these people were registered as missing since 2006, when the administration of Felipe Calderón, who took the army to the streets to combat the violence of organized crime, began.\n\"Many of the most serious effects of the anti-drug policy we have been suffering in Mexico for decades. More than half a million murders since the militarization began with President Calderon, more than 100,000 forced disappearances. We know that all that violence is unloaded, above all, against poor, racialized, brown young people, who live in the most disadvantaged areas of the country,\" says Zavala, who is surprised when people are alarmed by what Trump says. \"As if we weren't already living, for years now, a really serious wave of violence in the country.\"\nAccording to the researcher, military violence is often expressed as a form of social control, as a management of violence. \"You're not going to see militarization in areas like the Condesa or Roma, but in the margins of Mexico City, in the most impoverished areas. The violence is happening in the peripheries, in the poorest neighborhoods, where there is not even adequate monitoring by the media or human rights institutions,\" Zavala says.\nWhat should surprise us, Zavala says, are the very high rates of violence we are experiencing, as a background of what is already happening, not of something that is yet to come. \"I think we still don't fully understand that this violence has a clear class dimension. It is not generalized violence, but systematized and directed against the most vulnerable sectors of society,\" he says.\nThe Solution: Demilitarizing the Country\nThe decision taken by Calderón 16 years ago to entrust the Army with the responsibility of public security in several areas of the country has shown us its fatal consequences. Both Enrique Peña Nieto and Andrés Manuel López Obrador pledged, during their respective electoral campaigns, to return peace, security, and civility to us. However, once in power, both presented proposals to consolidate, through legislation and even constitutional reforms, the militarized public security model. The situation does not seem to change with Claudia Sheinbaum's administration.\nIn this way, Mexico's recent presidents have maintained a \"peace and security\" policy based on a militarized strategy, justifying it on the supposed operational incapacity of police corporations to confront organized crime.\n“I agree with the view that drugs need to be decriminalized, addictions treated, all that. But in my opinion, most of the violence in Mexico is not necessarily linked to drug trafficking, but to the experience of militarization itself. And I think there is solid empirical data to support this idea. We know that there is a ‘before’ and an ‘after’ militarization in Mexico,” Zavala explains. “Before the deployment of the army, our homicide rates were declining throughout the country, and there is a direct correlation between military occupation, the presence of the armed forces, and the increase in homicides and forced disappearances.”\nIn Zavala's opinion, the only way out of this spiral of violence in Mexico is to demilitarize the country. But it's not as simple as it might sound. Militarism is part of a global trend, and we are living in an era in which all Western democracies are becoming increasingly militarized, with effects similar to those we have experienced in Mexico.\n\"Military violence in the United States, for example, is also being discharged against minority and racialized populations, and, in addition, we have an unstoppable flow of weapons going from the global north to the global south. All of this is accompanied by extremely violent policies of control and security that in reality translate into extermination strategies and operations,\" he says. \"I don't see many ways out, because while López Obrador's government fills its mouth with speeches about sovereignty, militarism continues to advance. They continue to defend crimes against humanity committed by the army, they continue to detain and deport migrants, and they continue to use the army as a force for violence and social control. I don't believe there is any real will to dismantle the infrastructure of violence that militarization has created in Mexico.\"\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "content_text": "The wheels are already beginning to turn on Donald Trump’s plan to make the US into the “crypto capital of the planet” following his return to the White House.\nIn an executive order signed Thursday, Trump established a “working group on digital asset markets,” which will be responsible for weighing the possibility of the US forming a “strategic national digital asset stockpile,” among other things.\nThe promise to establish a stockpile was one of numerous commitments made by Trump to the crypto industry before he was reelected. Though the idea stumped economists, it received a rapturous reception among bitcoiners. As rumors of an impending announcement spread Thursday, the price of bitcoin climbed to $105,000 per coin, just short of the record high.\nThe order also requires the working group—which will comprise the leaders of various government branches, financial regulatory bodies, and the attorney general—to come up with an appropriate set of regulations and laws governing the use of crypto.\nEarlier in the week, on Trump’s second day in office, the Securities and Exchange Commission—the US regulatory body that brought a volley of lawsuits against crypto firms under the Joe Biden administration—established a “crypto task force.” Under new leadership following the departure of former chair Gary Gensler, who was widely demonized in the cryptosphere, the SEC will develop a “comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for crypto assets,” the agency stated.\nLater the same day, Trump granted clemency to Ross Ulbricht, who was serving life in prison for crimes committed while running the infamous darknet marketplace Silk Road, one of the first websites to accept bitcoin as payment. After being arrested in 2013, Ulbricht became something of a martyr in crypto circles for his part in spreading the bitcoin gospel.\nThese initial gestures signal Trump’s willingness to follow through on earlier campaign promises: to pass various crypto-related legislation, reform the financial regulatory apparatus in the US, and knit crypto into the US national treasury. The effects will be extensive, crypto figures believe, reverberating far beyond US shores and creating the conditions for a new golden era for the industry.\n“Our technology is very powerful and transformative. We need to land it in different societies,” says Joseph Lubin, cofounder of Ethereum and chief executive at software company Consensys. “And America is a standard-setter for the rest of the world.”\nDespite having previously spurned bitcoin as a “scam,” Trump now has extensive ties to the crypto industry, many high-profile members of which came out in support of his reelection campaign.\nIn the lead-up to the 2024 election, crypto organizations donated hundreds of millions of dollars to crypto-focused super political action committees, which spent the funds in support of crypto-friendly congressional candidates, many of them Republican.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump began to bill himself as the first “crypto president.” In July, in front of a rabid crowd of bitcoiners, Trump promised to turn the US into a crypto mining powerhouse and establish a national bitcoin stockpile if reelected. In the same speech, he pledged to fire Gensler, the SEC chair, prompting the most rapturous applause of the night.\nIn September, apparently dissatisfied with watching from the dugout, Trump and his family helped to launch a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, which they pitched as a way to “make finance great again.”\nDays before his inauguration, on January 17, Trump even launched his own official memecoin—a highly volatile type of cryptocurrency whose price is dictated by the amount of attention it attracts—sparking a trading frenzy. Two companies with connections to Trump own 80 percent of the total supply of the coin, a trove theoretically valued in the tens of billions of dollars.\nNow that Trump has skin in the game, the crypto industry can be all the more confident of his continued support, says Demelza Hays, digital asset portfolio manager at investment firm Zeltner & Co and chief economist at the crypto trade publication CoinTelegraph. “This was definitely saying that Trump is going to support crypto, profit from crypto, and try to remove any barriers to crypto,” says Hays. “All of a sudden, we have the president coming out and saying: ‘F you, I’m launching a memecoin.’”\nAfter Trump emerged victorious in November, the crypto industry worked closely with the transition team, WIRED reported, to select a new chair for the SEC, who would be tasked with creating a regulatory framework for crypto. Trump settled on crypto advocate and former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, who awaits confirmation.\nThe priority among crypto businesses is the ability to operate in the US without the fear of legal action by the SEC, which under Gensler took the view that many crypto businesses were violating securities laws, but declined to outline rules for the industry. “We’ve been operating under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty for a really long time,” says Lubin.\nIn the absence of clear rules, “the problem is that people end up trying to read the tea leaves,” said SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, who will lead the SEC’s new crypto task force, in an interview with WIRED last year. “A good way to handle this is not to bring a bunch of enforcement cases and [ask the industry] to connect all the dots.”\nThe new set of rules will liberate crypto entrepreneurs to press the limits of the technology, claims Noelle Acheson, a market analyst formerly of crypto brokerage Genesis. “The big impact will be all the building that has been on pause because of the SEC’s approach in the last four years,” she says. “We are now in a period of accelerated change—change on steroids.”\nThe initial offerings made to the crypto industry by Trump in the early days of his presidency, says Acheson, are but “a taste of what’s coming.”",

Its first project, scheduled for release later this year, will be an as-yet-unnamed horror game from Surgent Studios, the developer behind 2024’s Tales of Kenzera: Zau.\nPalworld, jokingly referred to as “Pokémon with guns,” was a breakout success last year, drawing in more than 25 million players in its first few months. The company’s step into publishing comes at a turbulent time for video games, especially smaller studios; last year, Among Us developer Innersloth announced its own move into publishing to help push projects forward. Pocketpair’s Palworld success, it seems, is allowing it to do the same.\n“As the games industry continues to grow, more and more games find themselves struggling to get funded or greenlit,” John Buckley, head of Pocketpair Publishing, said in a press release announcing the new division. “We think this is a real shame, because there are so many incredible creators and ideas out there that just need a little help to become incredible games.\"\nIt’s no surprise, then, that Pocketpair would work with Surgent Studios, which has struggled to find funding following the release of Zau.

Unlike the Afrofuturism of Zau, it’ll be a horror title meant to introduce players to something new. “We're taking a little detour from the Tales of Kenzera universe,” Salim says.\nSalim adds that the horror genre “is a fascinating space that taps into primal emotions, immersing audiences in a reality that's removed from their own yet strikes something deep and dark within us all.” Pocketpair and Surgent gave few details about the game in Thursday’s announcement, other than to describe it as “short and weird.”\n“The world is so raw right now, and it feels natural to craft an experience that reflects and feeds off that intensity,” Salim says.\nPocketpair Publishing has not announced any other future projects. The company has been embroiled in legal drama since last year, when Nintendo filed a lawsuit in Tokyo claiming Palworld infringed on its copyright. Nintendo did not respond to a request for comment. When asked if the lawsuit was of any concern to Surgent, Salim says the studio isn’t worried. “We’re really excited to be working with their new publishing wing to bring this game to life,” he says.",

OpenAI claims it has the potential to automate many day-to-day tasks and workday errands.\nOpenAI’s Operator follows rival releases by both Google and Anthropic, which have demonstrated ones capable of using the web. AI agents are widely seen as the next evolutionary stage for AI following chatbots, and many companies have hopped on the hype train by touting them. In most cases, these are very limited in their abilities and simply use a language model to automate things normally done with regular software.\n“AI is evolving from this tool that could answer your questions to one that is also able to take action in the world, carrying out complex, multistep workflows,” says Peter Welinder, VP of product at OpenAI. “We'll see a lot of impact on people’s productivity—but also the quality of work that people are able to accomplish.”\nOpenAI admits that giving ChatGPT access to a web browser does introduce new risks, and it says that Operator may sometimes misbehave. It says it has implemented various new safeguards and plans to extend Operator’s capabilities gradually.\nWelinder and Yash Kumar, product and engineering lead for OpenAI’s Computer Using Agent, say the plan is to learn from how people use the tool. They acknowledge that the tool could make unwanted bookings or purchases but add that a lot of work has gone into ensuring that it asks before doing anything risky. “It will come back to me and ask for confirmations before taking steps that might be irreversible,” Kumar says.\nOpenAI today also released a new “system card” outlining the problems that might arrive with Operator. These include the potential for it to misunderstand commands or diverge from what a user asks; to be misused by users; or to be targeted by cybercriminals.\n“It also poses an incredible amount of safety challenges,” Kumar says. “Because your attack vector area and your risk vector area increase quite significantly.”\nOperator will initially be available as a “research preview” for ChatGPT users with a Pro account, which costs a hefty $200 per month. The company says it plans to expand access while rolling the tool out slowly, because it will inevitably make some mistakes along the way.\nIn several demonstrations, Operator showed the potential for AI to take on a more active role as a web helper. The tool features a remote web browser and a chat window for communicating with a user.\nAt WIRED’s request, Operator was asked to book an Amtrak train trip from New Haven, Connecticut, to Washington, DC. It went to the right website and entered the necessary information correctly to bring up the timetable, then asked for further instruction. If a user were logged in to the Amtrak website or into a browser profile with stored credit card information, Operator would be able to go ahead and book a ticket—although it is designed to ask for permission first.\nKumar asked Operator to book a table at Beretta, a restaurant in San Francisco. The program went to the OpenTable website, found the correct restaurant, and looked up availability before asking what to do next. OpenAI says it has partnered with a number of popular sites, including OpenTable, to ensure that Operator works smoothly on them.\nThe new tool is based on OpenAI’s GPT-4o AI model, which can perceive a browser and web page and converse in typed text. The tool incorporates additional training designed to help it understand how to execute tasks online. OpenAI will also make its Computer Use Agent available through its API.",

    "content_text": "It would be inaccurate to refer to Enrique Tarrio, who was the leader of the Proud Boys on January 6, 2021, when dozens of members stormed the Capitol, as the gang’s “ex–chairman.”\nWithin hours of being sprung free from a federal prison in Pollock, Louisiana, on Tuesday, Tarrio called into Infowars to speak with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to correct the record.\nDuring that call, Tarrio—who received a sentence of 22 years for seditious conspiracy charges but was freed thanks to the flurry of nearly 1,600 pardons and sentence commutations for January 6-ers issued by the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump—made it very clear that he had absolutely no intention of distancing himself from the far-right street-fighting gang.\n“As far as my future with the organization goes, I’m not going anywhere,” Tarrio said. “We’ve made the decision not to talk publicly about the group’s structure. But I have some suggestions for the media: They should stop calling me the ex–Proud Boys leader.”\nIt’s been a long time coming, but it appears that the Proud Boys are plotting a comeback. And they want revenge.\n“I'm happy that the president is focusing not on retribution, and focusing on success. But I will tell you, I'm not going to play by those rules,” Tarrio told Jones. “The people who did this, they need to feel the heat, they need to be put behind bars, they need to be prosecuted. They need to be imprisoned. We need to find and put them behind bars for what they did.”\n“The Proud Boys are not terrorist masterminds. These are not the brightest neofascists out there,” said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. “But they are committed to the cause. They are single-minded in this mission now: for revenge, for retribution. And as we’ve seen before, they are willing to go across state lines and use violence in furtherance of their goals.”\nAn analysis of Proud Boys’ social media channels by the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism identified a surge in online activity following the January 6 pardons, including discussions of ramping up real-world activism to help further the Trump administration's agenda. “Posts from Proud Boys groups reveal an emboldened network, with members fantasizing about mass deportation schemes and threatening to escalate their attacks during Pride Month,” the GPAHE said in a statement. “These developments point to a broader alignment between extremist groups and the Trump regime, raising urgent concerns about public safety and the normalization of far-right violence.” A North Carolina chapter, via its Telegram channel, proposed carrying out “bount[ies on illegals.” A chapter in upstate New York gleefully circulated a rumor that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was offering $750 rewards to turn in undocumented immigrants.\nIn the years since the Capitol riot, as dozens of Proud Boy members and leaders copped charges for the insurrection, the group became increasingly elusive and unpredictable. They pivoted away from large-scale public demonstrations—which would often involve 100 or so Proud Boys descending on a city, clad in yellow and black, reeking of beer, looking for media attention and fights—and instead embedded themselves into hyperlocal culture wars across the country, in many cases aligning themselves with Christian nationalists. They started showing up to small protests against vaccines, crashed school board meetings, and intimidated attendees at drag brunches. For the most part, they stayed away from cities or towns where they were likely to encounter opposition.\nThough they mobilized in a few instances in support of Trump ahead of the 2024 election, it was, overall, fairly lackluster, especially compared to 2020. This drove speculation that the gang was on its last legs.\nThen, on Monday, as Trump was taking the oath of office, more than 100 uniformed Proud Boys marched through the streets of Washington, DC, led by their south-Florida chapter.\nIt was a striking scene—one that seemed intended to send a clear message: “We’re back.”\nEver since January 6, 2021, DC has been perceived by the far right as a no-go zone for Trump supporters of all stripes. But on Monday the Proud Boys chanted “Whose streets—our streets.” They received a hero’s welcome by other Trump supporters in the crowd, as seen on video recorded by freelance journalist Ford Fischer.\nOn Tuesday, as bureaucratic snafus delayed the release of about a dozen January 6-ers from the DC jail, protesters gathered outside. Among them were at least four uniformed Proud Boys. Though three of them had their faces covered, they milled around with what appeared to be zero concern about stigma from others present. Oath Keeper founder Stewart Rhodes, whose 18-year sentence for seditious conspiracy was commuted by Trump, also appeared outside the jail—having walked free from a federal prison in Maryland the previous night.\nOne of the Proud Boys present spoke at the impromptu rally outside of the jail, identifying himself as “Harry Fox.” (This was the same name that other Proud Boys had given to reporters on Inauguration Day.)\n“Donald Trump is back, baby. He is back, and he is stronger than ever,” he said over the microphone. “I’m so proud of what the American citizens did that day,” he added, referring to January 6, “for standing up finally after decades of being abused and oppressed by an authoritarian regime.”\nHe ended his speech with the Proud Boys slogan: “I am a Western chauvinist, and I will not apologize for creating the modern world.” The crowd cheered.\nTarrio, in his phone call to Jones on Tuesday, made it clear that he views the role of the Proud Boys as being no different to what it was four years ago—he sees them as the foot soldiers and the muscle of the GOP. “I think the future of the club will be what it’s always been,” said Tarrio. “A group of men that love America, get around and drink beer, and protect Trump supporters from being assaulted … We will defend ourselves and Trump supporters from being assaulted for their political views.”\nHe suggested that he feels vindicated by Trump’s election victory and decision to pardon almost everyone involved in the January 6 riot. “We went through hell, and I’m gonna tell you: It was worth it,” Tarrio told Jones. “What we stood for and what those guys stood for is what we’ve been fighting for, is what we saw yesterday on the inauguration stage … I can’t tell you it's been easy. But I will tell you it's been worth it.”\nWhatever stigma may have been attached to the Proud Boys appears to have dissipated.\nTrump has defended his decision to pardon or commute the sentences of January 6-ers, including those of notorious Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. And when asked by a reporter whether he could envision a place for members of those groups in politics. “Well, we have to see,” Trump responded. “They’ve been given a pardon. I thought their sentences were ridiculous and excessive.”\nBut even with talks of revenge and plans for the future, the gang is far less cohesive than it was prior to January 6. The arrests of members and leaders in connection to the Capitol riot fueled paranoia about informants and exacerbated existing rifts—especially after a report published in late January 2021 exposed Tarrio’s history as a “prolific” police informant. The Proud Boys claimed that they dissolved the group’s “Sovereign Chapter” in the years following, leaving the chapters to operate autonomously. The group also struggled to find its place in the broader far-right ecosystem, with some chapters cozying up to even more extreme factions like neo-Nazis as others sought legitimacy by seeking alliances with conservative influencers.\nBut as January 6 showed, someone doesn’t need to be a card-carrying member of a group, Proud Boys or otherwise, to be emboldened by the pardons. “How many people are going to be emboldened by this, how many are going to take this as justification, as their call to arms, to say ‘we have to fight now against the prosecutors, the FBI agents, the so-called deep state,’” says Lewis. “These are people who have a track record of being allowed to commit violence in the name of their ideology, and they’ve been given a second chance to do just that.”",

    "content_text": "In the first 48 hours of President Donald Trump’s second term in office, he has taken action on virtually every single culture war topic that has excited his base for the last 12 months, including the signing of dozens of executive orders targeting immigrants, gender expression, the environment, and DEI policies.\nTrump has also pardoned or commuted the sentence of every single person that took part in the violent insurrection at the Capitol in 2021. Meanwhile, his close ally Elon Musk has invigorated an even more extreme wing of Trump’s supporters, by making a Nazi-like salute onstage—twice—in front of thousands of people in DC and millions watching on TV.\nTrump’s actions have generated a lot of excitement among the far-right in the US. They’ve also been hailed as a blueprint by an adoring fan base of far-right lawmakers, extremist influencers, and white supremacist groups across the globe. And those people and organizations now believe that Trump’s actions should not only be copied, but taken to the next level.\n“It is more than just a political success,” Martin Sellner, the far-right activist and leader of the Identitarian Movement of Austria, wrote on his Telegram channel. “It is a metapolitical victory: the end of wokeness and trans ideology, stopping illegal immigration and many other ideas have been normalized in society.”\n“These extremists think that this is the way to go, that their countries need to take a lesson from what Trump is proposing, and they need to not get weak about it, and not let woke activists get in their way, because everybody knows that the right thing to do is get rid of the immigrants,” Wendy Via, the CEO of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, tells WIRED.\nSellner, who once communicated with the Christchurch massacre shooter, is best known for popularizing the white nationalist concept of “remigration,” the idea to ethnically cleanse western nations of all nonwhite citizens. That extremist ideology has gained traction among other far-right groups in Europe, including Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Freedom Party of Austria. Trump even promoted “remigration” in September.\nNow, Sellner believes that Trump’s return to the Oval Office signals a moment to take his agenda mainstream.\n“By pushing further into the realm of the ‘unspeakable’ we move out of the defensive and truly shift the Overton Window to the right for the first time,” Sellner wrote. “Even if you think Trumpism goes far enough, you should support the radical flank.”\nSellner is not alone in Europe. Across the continent, far-right figures praised Trump’s actions on migration and gender, and called for leaders in their own countries to follow suit.\nIn France, the Generation Identity group, the youth wing of the far-right Identitarian movement, wrote on Telegram: “Remigration in full swing. Identitarianism has won ideologically, it will only take time for this victory to be reflected in the material world.”\nIn Ireland, Keith Woods, the far-right influencer and ally of US white supremacist Nick Fuentes, shared a clip of Musk’s Nazi-like salute with the caption: “Ok maybe woke really is dead.” Irish UFC fighter Conor McGregor, who has aligned himself with Ireland’s far-right community in recent years, was in the Capitol for the inauguration and met with House speaker Mike Johnson. McGregor praised Trump’s immigration policies and wrote on Instagram, “Ireland and its human trafficking racket needs absolute dismantling! It is a breach of our security and our sovereignty. For me it is A NATIONAL EMERGENCY.” (McGregor has recently said that he is considering running for president in Ireland, which is a symbolic role without any real power.)\nIn the UK, Tommy Robinson, whose legal bills are now being footed by Elon Musk, wrote that Trump’s inauguration signaled that “freedom is back” and hailed the “return of the king.” Robinson, who is currently in jail for making repeated false allegations against a Syrian refugee, which led to death threats against their family, is a well-known Islamophobic activist and former member of the fascist British National Party. Robinson’s compatriot Mark Collet, who heads up the white supremacist Patriotic Alternative group, praised the pardoning of the January 6 prisoners, writing on Telegram: “What a first day, this is a massive redemption arc.”\nIn Brazil, far-right lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro, who was invited to the inauguration but could not travel because of his alleged role in a Brazilian coup attempt in 2023, wrote a lengthy message to Trump, saying that “under Trump’s leadership, the West is being reborn.” He added that Trump’s return “reaffirms the pillars of our civilization: God, nation, family, and freedom.”\nIn Germany, Sebastian Schmidtke, the leader of the neo-Nazi Die Heimat party, wrote, “Greetings back from Germany @elonmusk” above a clip on X of Musk’s Nazi-like salute. The country’s far-right publication COMPACT also praised Trump’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization, citing the organization’s “evil nature during the Corona period.”\n“There is huge support for Trump in the German far-right, and they see themselves emboldened by it,” Miro Dittrich, a researcher who focuses on German extremist groups, tells WIRED.\nDittrich analyzed the links shared in thousands of German-speaking far-right and conspiracy-driven Telegram channels, and found that they had a strong focus on Trump, Musk, and the US inauguration as compared to the upcoming German elections.\nIn Australia, neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell shared a picture of himself making a similar salute to Musk’s, writing on X: “Donald Trump, White Power, Patriots are in control.”\n“This is the vision they have for the world, and Trump is their hero at the moment,” says Via.",

What is truth? Truth is, it's up for debate. Yeah.\nMichael Calore: It is. Literally.\nZoë Schiffer: We're a post-truth era.\nMichael Calore: Ain't that the truth?\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I feel like we've been saying that for years, but now it really feels true.\nMichael Calore: Well, the truth and how to moderate it online, and specifically how Mark Zuckerberg is thinking about it is what we are here to examine. So I hope the two of you have some time on your hands.\nZoë Schiffer: Let's do it.\nMichael Calore: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm Zoë Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nLauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: Today we're talking about content moderation because the big news over the past couple of weeks is that Meta is ending its third-party fact-checking program and replacing it with a Community Notes model. Now to be clear, the company is still keeping its automated systems for flagging problematic content, but Mark Zuckerberg has also said that Meta would be refocusing or tweaking those systems to flag what he calls high-severity violations. So we'll get into all of these changes and talk about their potential impacts.\nLauren Goode: Zoë, how would you describe Community Notes for the uninitiated?\nZoë Schiffer: It's basically crowdsourced fact-checking. The idea is that you get users to apply to these programs. If they get in, they become part of the Community Notes forum, which means that when a post is flagged, they have a debate with other people in the forum, should it have a note attached to it with a bit more context. The issue is that on X, what we've seen from inside these forums is that a lot of the people involved are pretty politically motivated. But in theory, it's a way to kind of allow the community to moderate content on the platform themselves.\nLauren Goode: Right. The idea of Community Notes may have worked really well about 20 to 30 years ago in the early days of the internet, the World Wide Web. But when you're looking at the amount of content that is posted online now, it's not exactly the same. I mean, I think a lot of these Meta changes are just going to encourage more content to surface, just more of everything, which is very good for engagement for Meta, for its bottom line, and possibly or probably bad for humanity.\nZoë Schiffer: It feels like it's bigger than just Meta. Like you mentioned. It's kind of following in the footsteps of X in terms of turning to a Community Notes-style fact-checking program. So to me, it gets to this bigger question of, are we in a new era of content moderation, and what does that mean for the world?\nMichael Calore: So let's back up for a moment and clarify what we're talking about when we talk about content moderation.\nLauren Goode: When I look at content moderation, I see it as part of usually what is a trust and safety team at a tech company or a social media company. Trust and safety has a larger mandate than just content moderation, but content moderation tends to fall into secondary and tertiary levels of trust and safety work. The idea with content moderation is that you're looking at types of posts that could cause real harm, and that's either through misinformation or hate speech. It's not personalized. It's not someone on Facebook saying they have a cat named Bo when their cat's name is Boo. Or someone saying, \"I won an award,\" and they didn't really win an award, and they're inflating themselves. This is misinformation generally accepted as truth that affects people on a societal level.\nZoë Schiffer: I think that's a good definition. I think of it really like the people and policies that decide which posts stay up and which ones come down. Often the ones that are supposed to come down are ones that violate a platform's rules. So we talk about the First Amendment and free speech a lot in relation to content moderation, but in reality, none of these companies have to abide by the First Amendment. It's not a government entity. So it's really about what policies have we set up as a company, have we said that we're OK with versus not OK with? Then what systems do we have in place to regulate which posts stay up and come down?\nMichael Calore: In the past, the ancient past, it fell on human beings, like moderators in small communities. I'm talking like pre-Facebook internet. You had Listservs, you had forums, you had places where people would hang out, and it would be dozens or hundreds of people. You had human moderators sort of making decisions on a case-by-case basis of what sorts of things would be allowed, what sorts of things step over the line of the community guidelines that the community decided on for itself. Of course, there are a lot of sites and platforms and communities that are still employing this type of content moderation. Reddit famously has mods. There are even subreddits for complaining about mods, things like that. But if you belong to a community and there's 2,000 or 3,000 people in those communities, you show up, there's a list of rules, things that are allowed, things that are not allowed, and they're what you would expect. We do not allow name-calling. We don't allow threats of violence. We don't allow things that are not within the scope of this community to be posted here. It's a moderator's job, often with the help of bots, to go through all of the posts that are made and decide which ones don't belong and get rid of them.\nZoë Schiffer: This also happens on Wikipedia. Wikipedia obviously has volunteer editors. There's a hierarchy. You have to be one of the chosen. But I will say, I know Reddit and Wikipedia have had a lot of issues with content moderation, but these processes seem to work pretty well on the platforms. I would say part of the reason for that is that we have the media literacy to treat what we read on Wikipedia with a certain level of suspicion. It's both surprisingly accurate a lot of the time, but I think a lot of us are used to saying, “OK, I'll Wikipedia as a first order of research, but I'll obviously do a deeper dive and read the source material when needed.”\nLauren Goode: There are an incredible number of citations on Wikipedia too. So it's easy then to go to one of the source materials, and then from there use that same level of media literacy to determine if that seems like a valid source. But then there are people contributing, who are looking for those valid sources to cite. I think that's one of the differences too, not that we're talking about Google Gen AI in this episode so much, but the difference is people just look at those summarized search results now and say, “That must be true,” even if there is a little citation somewhere. Whereas in Wikipedia, you go and then hopefully you go further from there.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. But then in the Facebook era and then in the Twitter era, these platforms, these social platforms evolved that were all owned by one company, and then the company could set a policy that would apply to all of their communities. I think that's when things really started to change.\nLauren Goode: Well, and it started to change, too, just when the number of users on Facebook swelled to over a billion people. I can't say exactly what date Facebook first deployed an algorithm to try to detect harmful content. But we do know it was around late 2016 when Facebook first said it was partnering with places like the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network. So at that point, it was using both human moderators and automated systems to try to limit what everyone at the time was concerned about, which was basically fake news.\nZoë Schiffer: Right. I think just to take it back a little bit further even, it's like a lot of these tech platforms start out with similar values around free speech. They're like, “We started these companies to maximize speech or to create a global town square,” whatever, but then they all kind of agree like, “Oh wait, we can't have child sexual exploitation material. We can't have illegal content. You can't sell drugs on the platform.” So slowly, slowly they start to limit the amount of speech that can actually happen on the platform.\nMichael Calore: So in the most recent modern era, since 2016, what has Meta been doing?\nLauren Goode: Well, 2016 feels like a turning point in a sense, because this was when they started partnering with a handful of traditional news organizations and fact-checking sites. The thing is that a lot of the impetus for this was misinformation around the 2016 presidential election, like the fake news that the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump or conspiracy theories around Hillary Clinton. So Meta was, or Facebook at the time, they were really sort of targeting that by leaning on these third-party organizations. Then I think they still had the automated systems in place to try to tackle some of the other hateful or harmful speech that was happening on the platform. What's interesting about this is that it feels like at the time Facebook did in a sense believe that it had a moral imperative to do this, to try to crack down on that. It was acknowledging that having all this misinformation on a platform as big as Facebook could have a negative impact on society,\nMichael Calore: Right.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. I feel like this was the era of Mark Zuckerberg really taking ownership and being like, “We know we've messed up. Here's all the investments that we're making to make this better.” But it's also true that each one of these systems had advantages and disadvantages.\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nZoë Schiffer: Meta invested enormously in teams of contract human moderators whose entire job it was to look at the worst that the internet had to offer, at least the worst that Meta's platforms had to offer, and decide which posts should stay up, which should come down, and occasionally which ones should be escalated for further review. The issue is that these people are not necessarily working at the corporate offices. They're allegedly often being paid pretty low wages from contracting firms and they're looking at really traumatizing content all day. Really, really violent images, child sexual abuse material, that sort of thing. Honestly, there's been a lot of allegations about how traumatized they're getting and the fact that the companies they work for allegedly don't have the mental health resources to really support them. So it's creating a lot of issues for these people.\nMichael Calore: So we're facing a shift on all of Meta's platforms to a Community Notes style of fact-checking. What does that look like on X? How is it going to look on Instagram? How's it going to look on Meta, Facebook?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, so when someone posts on these platforms, rather than having these fact checking or news organizations deciding, is this post correct? We're going to have real people in the community, so users, and it's supposed to be a large enough user base that you have people who come at this from all different sides of the political spectrum who are having that debate and then posting a note attached to it. On X, at least in terms of big breaking news events, it hasn't worked that well. But I actually feel like there is potential for this system to work well. It just hasn't been implemented correctly at X for unsurprising reasons. So when Mark Zuckerberg made this announcement, I felt like all of my group chats were popping off and 100 percent of the voices were aghast and really anti this decision. I had a moment where I was like at least for this part of the change. To be clear, I think a lot of the changes are extremely problematic and will create a lot of real-world harm. I'm genuinely worried about that. But in terms of scrapping the third-party fact-checking system and going to Community Notes, I am willing to entertain the possibility that this could be good if implemented correctly.\nLauren Goode: I think you bring up a good point, Zoë, about how for unsurprising reasons Community Notes might not be working on X. I think what you're referring to is the fact that Musk is using X as his personal megaphone now, and he has a lot of stans on that platform. I read that at least 50 of Musk's own posts last year promoted information about the US elections that fact-checkers said were false or misleading, and they amassed something like a billion views and none of these had Community Notes attached. This is according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which has been studying this.\nZoë Schiffer: It's easily gamified on X right now. I'm actually not sure if that's just because they don't have enough people in the Community Notes forum or if it's that … I've kind of seen this firsthand and in talking to sources, who allege that Community Notes can be pretty politically motivated. It seems like at least on X, there's a large contingent of the fact-checkers who are very, very pro-Musk and are looking for stories that paint him in what they see as a biased light. They're attaching spurious Community Notes on those stories, and then they're not adequately fact-checking Musk's own posts. So there's a lot of problems. But again, to me, this isn't so much a failure of Community Notes overall as much as it is a failure of X's version of Community Notes.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Also, I'll say that I don't really have a lot of faith that this is going to stop the spread of misinformation or stop the spread of hateful content, simply because we've all been there where we see a post that we understand is fake or we understand possibly could be considered by most people to be hateful, and it may have some sort of note under it, or maybe people are sounding off in the comments about the fact that it's fake or that it's hateful and maybe it's been flagged. But it's still there, and it's still being shared. I think that people who are going to share those types of things are going to be inclined to share them even if it has some sort of mechanism attached to it that says, “Our community has flagged this as possibly not good.”\nZoë Schiffer: I think the purpose of this change is not to stop the spread of harmful content. To me, the purpose of this change is definitely to ingratiate Meta with the Trump administration, and it honestly seems like that's gone over pretty well.\nMichael Calore: That's a big claim, and it's a big moment, and I agree with you. I think when Mark Zuckerberg talks about this, he says that stopping people from talking about things like transgender issues puts Meta in a position that is out of step with modern discourse. So he says that people talk about these things, and we have to let them talk about them on our platforms in a way that is not overseen or regulated, just because that's the way that people talk now.\nLauren Goode: Right, but to Zoë's point, he also basically admits that he was very put off by what he saw as an overreach by the Biden administration to try to “censor” Facebook during the Covid pandemic. So I think that Zuckerberg is giving all kinds of reasons for why he's making this decision now, whether it's, “Oh, we've scaled, we're at such a scale that our systems can't possibly address all of this, or this is just the way people talk these days, and we want to give people the ability to say what they want. Anyone who quits Facebook at this point is virtue signaling. Have at it. We still have plenty of users.” When really it is a political reaction and maneuver. I was talking to someone in tech and asked them, what do you think about the changes that Meta is making to its content moderation policies? They said, “Zuckerberg is kind of like a weather vane. He just moves in the right direction depending on the wind. But the problem is he's also so powerful now that he generates a lot of wind, so when he tips the weather vane, he's now moving the wind in a new direction.”\nZoë Schiffer: I found this whole topic so interesting because I was coming at it from a place of maybe this change could be positive. I want to believe that Community Notes could work. At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg's actions and the way he talked about them made me feel like he's very opportunistic. He's company first, and he's doing what he needs to do to get in good with this incoming administration. It definitely did not seem to come from a principled stance in so far as those principles are important to him, personally.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. So how is Zuckerberg's decision resonating with other people in Silicon Valley? Because I know what the headlines say. The headlines say that Meta is just giving up on content moderation and that kind of anything goes, and we're in Meta's AI slop era now.\nLauren Goode: Right, right. Well, and Meta would probably, or Zuckerberg himself might even respond and say, “Well, those are just the elite established media who are reacting that way,” because he talked about that on the Joe Rogan podcast too. That person I spoke to in the Valley made that remark about Zuckerberg being a weather vane. I've also talked to people who worked in trust and safety directly who have said it's just a really hard problem to solve.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I feel like there's the media which seemed to think this was a very bad idea, and again, there were newsrooms that were involved in the fact-checking process, so obviously we're going to think it's bad when these programs are killed. There's the trust and safety world, which I saw saying, “We really disagree with this change,” but interestingly, a lot of them were not pointing to the switch from human moderators and algorithms over to Community Notes as much as they were the fact that Meta is not going to proactively look for lesser violations. That was the one that started to really worry that group of people. Then we had the tech elite, the Silicon Valley billionaires, the venture capitalists, the people who are friends with Elon Musk. These people seem extremely excited. We all listened to Mark Zuckerberg's interview with Joe Rogan. Rogan seemed thrilled about the change, as did the guys on the All In podcast. While they might've disagreed with why Zuck made the change, I think everyone seemed very, very excited that in their view he was coming around.\nLauren Goode: There are so many layers to this, and I think what we've talked about a lot so far are his motivations. That's a little bit harder because all we can do is sort of look at his actions and his policy decisions over the past several years and say, \"OK, this lines up, or this is what he said, this podcast or in this interview, and this is all pretty consistent.\" We don't really know his motivations. We can't get inside Mark Zuckerberg's head. Then there's the practical implementation of what he's putting forward, and I think everyone can agree content moderation on a platform that has at least 2 billion daily active users around the world, people logging into it every day, is a very hard problem to solve. It is, right? Now, my harsher take on that is that I have 215 billion reasons why it is actually Mark Zuckerberg's job to solve this. That is his net worth. He wanted the job, he started this company, he wanted voting control, and this is the job. He said on Joe Rogan, “Well, if I just did this all the time, I wouldn't have time to focus on AI or smart glasses. Things that we understand are very important to the company's bottom line.” Mark, I just want to say we don't necessarily need the smart glasses. We need to fix content moderation. We need you to fix content moderation. That is the job.\nMichael Calore: Zoë's snapping her fingers in agreement. I agree with you too. I mean, it is the thing that makes it a fun place to hang out is the fact that it's a happy place on the internet. You can go there, you can see things that make you smile, and the more that you see things that don't make you smile, the harder it gets to keep going back there. Knowing that he's made these decisions makes it harder for me to decide to go back there. I just know that it's a different kind of beast now. What we're going to be feeding it and the types of conversations that are going to be happening there are going to be very different, and I think it's going to feel very different going into the year. We're going to take a quick break. When we come back, we're going to get into Lauren's 215 billion reasons why content moderation is important, and we're also going to talk about what might happen on social media at large in the wake of these changes. Stay with us. You're listening to Uncanny Valley.\n[break]\nMichael Calore: So we've been talking about the recent changes around content moderation and speech moderation at Meta. One of the things that we cannot ignore is that the same week that Mark Zuckerberg announced all these changes coming to Meta's content moderation policies, he started talking about it publicly. Here he is on the Joe Rogan podcast:\nMark Zuckerberg [archival audio]: It goes back to our original mission, is just give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.\nMichael Calore: I do think it's important to talk about Zuck's appearance on the show because he does talk at length about his motivations. We can't step inside of his head and we can't say what's really going on there, but we have a pretty clear idea about why these changes are coming to Meta. So where should we start?\nZoë Schiffer: I mean, he really framed this as a return to his roots. On the podcast he kind of speaks to that ethos and the idea that he never really wanted to be in a position of deciding what's true and what's not. He says that in his view, misinformation and hate speech in particular in recent years became very politicized. So it definitely feels like under the Biden administration, Meta was being asked to take down a lot of Covid misinformation, hate speech, other things. Zuck says he was growing increasingly uncomfortable with that, and so this is an opportunity to right the ship in his view.\nLauren Goode: Let’s talk a little bit more about what exactly went down, because it wasn't just the requests from the Biden administration for him to moderate Covid information. I mean, this goes back to when he was grilled in front of Congress. Right?\nZoë Schiffer: This went all the way up to the Supreme Court in a famous job owning case recently. But yeah, I mean basically Zuck is saying, “Look, the Biden administration was coming to us. We had people from the administration literally yelling at my employees, saying, you have to take this stuff down. So we were putting a lot of investment in place and trying to moderate content at a scale and in a way that we'd never done before.” It's so interesting because moderating this type of content, moderating misinformation and hate speech opened Meta up to a lot of criticism from both the right and the left. The right, because conservatives are moderated more on these grounds, because they tend to speak in this way more, and the left because we were still seeing all sorts of content stay up that a lot of people on the left thought should come down. So making this decision saying, “We're actually going to moderate a lot less speech than we have in recent memory,” endears Meta to the right and opens it up to criticism from the left. But it's like in some ways a better position to be in than where they were at previously, where both sides thought we were horrible and messing up.\nLauren Goode: He also made some interesting remarks about the government's role and how it treats tech companies.\nMark Zuckerberg [archival audio]: The US government should be defending its companies, not be the tip of the spear attacking its companies.\nLauren Goode: Look, Zuckerberg is clearly a very intelligent individual, and he's trying to work through these things. But I thought this was interesting because he said that he thought the US government shouldn't be adversarial toward its own tech companies, because that paves the way for other countries to also penalize their companies.\nMark Zuckerberg [archival audio]: It's basically just open season around the rest of the world. The EU, I pulled these numbers, the EU has fined the tech companies more than $30 billion over the last, I think, it was like 10 or 20 years.\nLauren Goode: He pointed to Europe as an example, and all the fines that it has levied on American tech companies in recent years. He also pointed out that we already have plenty of adversaries like Russia and Iran to deal with. But it's actually not the US government's singular job to be a booster for American enterprise. It also has a responsibility to protect its citizens, and there are entire agencies that exist, and for good reason, to make sure companies in the private sector aren't taking advantage of or harming consumers. I think he just, I don't know, conveniently ignored that.\nZoë Schiffer: You do hear the Silicon Valley billionaire class talk about this a lot. They're like, “Well, Trump just wants America to win.” That's really appealing to them, because they see their own companies and their venture capital firms as a core part of that winning strategy.\nMichael Calore: What I think is interesting is the timing of all of this. We cannot ignore the politics when we look at the timing, because if you consider content moderation coming into focus for Meta in 2016, all eyes were on the company during the 2020 election. Again, all eyes were on the company during the 2024 election. So Meta kept its policies in place for fact-checking up until the election, the election happened, Trump won the presidency again, and then two months later they're shutting down the shop. I kind of feel like, “OK, let's do the bare minimum until we can get past this point where we don't really have to worry about it anymore, and then we can stop worrying about it.” That really feels like what happened. Whether or not that's appeasing Republicans or whether or not that is trying to open up conversation to the winners in this scenario so that they feel more comfortable on our platform because they're in power now. I really feel like it's more like, “OK, we've done the thing that we promised we would do, and now we just don't really have to worry about it anymore.”\nZoë Schiffer: I think there's another factor at play here, which is that previously, I think not every company thought of it this way, but there was this line that content moderation is a product, and it's a product that in some ways you sell to advertisers. When you have a platform that is ad supported, you need to make sure that Nike isn't paying millions of dollars and seeing their ads show up next to a violent video, or hate speech, or what have you. With X in particular, when Elon Musk rolled back a lot of the fact-checking programs, the trust and safety policies, we saw advertisers take a real stand and flee. Under a Trump administration, do we think these massive multinational conglomerates, these big corporations are going to take a principled stand like that? Or are they going to say, “Okay, whatever, it's an advertising platform, we'll keep spending money.” I would be surprised if we saw a big advertiser exodus. Maybe they will make those decisions and they'll just make it quietly. But I almost think that the business calculus for content moderation has changed under a Trump administration.\nLauren Goode: Zoë, you've mentioned something before that I find really interesting, which is this idea that if some organization or company were to get content moderation right, they could sell it as a product. What does that look like?\nZoë Schiffer: I mean, I think if you are a place where you're like, \"We have the best algorithms in place, we have the best trust and safety policies, you can be 100 percent certain that if you spend thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars on our platform to advertise with us, 100 percent of the time, your ad will not show up next to anything bad. It will show up next to the tweet from LeBron James, which is all you've ever wanted.\" I think that that would be a compelling use case for advertisers, because advertisers don't want to spend all of that money and see their ad … It's embarrassing for them if it runs next to something really vile. At the same time, if every platform is doing the opposite of what we're saying, if they're moderating less content, and advertisers are kind of like, \"OK, this is just what it means to advertise on social media.\" I don't know if they're going to be pulling ad dollars like they did with Elon or with Facebook in 2020.\nMichael Calore: I think we'll have to see how bad it gets, because soon we'll probably see more AI-generated images of things that are fake, fake images of famous people, fake images of political figures. We're probably going to see more hateful content, things that are hateful towards women, towards transgender people, towards immigrants. We'll probably see more fake news, things that are intended to rile us up if we feel a certain way about the world, things that are very sharable. There's probably also going to be a lot of AI profiles, like AI people sharing things, nonplayer characters in our feeds. However many there are now, which is probably a lot more than we realize, there's going to be more. So as these things increase, it's going to start to feel a lot different to hang out at those places for users and for advertisers. I don't know if advertisers are going to stick around if that becomes like what is shared dominantly on the platforms.\nZoë Schiffer: Well, Mike, that immediately makes me think that advertisers can have whatever stance they want, but ultimately they are paying to have their ad in front of the maximum number of eyeballs. So if users find it bad to hang out on these platforms for all of the reasons you just stated and they start to flee, then advertisers are going to vote with their dollars and they're also going to exit. So this is going to be, I think, a really interesting phenomenon to watch.\nMichael Calore: There's a lot of people who think that that's fun. It's fun to show up and share all the images of Trump in the Superman costume.\nZoë Schiffer: Well, they can stick around.\nMichael Calore: One thing that I'm curious about that's very distressing to me to think about is what the future of the moderation industry is. I didn't even really think about this at first until our colleague, David Gilbert, wrote a fantastic story for WIRED, which you can read, about the moderation industry and how so many of these companies, basically when they got the Meta contracts in the 2010s, they set up departments and they hired all these people to do the fact checking for Meta. Now that Meta is shutting down the program and not keeping all of those contracts anymore, a lot of these companies are going to be out of the social media content moderation business, which means that this change is going to be much more far-reaching. It's going to have much bigger impact than just Meta. I'm wondering what that future looks like across all of social media.\nLauren Goode: I mean, to me, this goes back to the idea that we're in a post social media era. It's not just about post-truth, it's about these apps, and services, and feeds, and containers that came to define how we connected to people and how we shared things over the past, let's say 15 years, even though Facebook's been around since 2004. It's fundamentally shifting, and I don't think we have yet landed on what is the next social experience online then totally. I certainly don't know what it is. I don't know if it's... I think a lot of us are using private group chats. I think people are leaning on newsletters instead of other types of distributed information. I think it's time to acknowledge that the social media we knew it as the 2010s is dead.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. I agree with Lauren on that.\nMichael Calore: I think you're right.\nLauren Goode: Content moderation is a huge part of that.\nZoë Schiffer: To the extent we ever had a global town square, which I kind of roll my eyes at that phrasing, but I certainly think that we do not have one now and we will not have one in the foreseeable future.\nLauren Goode: No, we don't. We've all had these personal feeds, these personal experiences, and it really was all, we talked about this on an earlier podcast, but it really was all about the self and feeding the self. Then there are these collective experiences that are supposed to be happening on social media too. I think people are just continuing to posts to their personal feeds as much as they want, but you cannot ignore the collapse of what the collective experience has been.\nMichael Calore: To that collective experience, to that global town square, that was absolutely my favorite thing about the old Twitter was that it was people of all different political ideologies all in one place, and it was still fun most of the time. It was still fun. It kind of stopped being fun. Now it's like the Internet's getting more tribal. Now there's a lib zone, there's a red zone, there's a libertarian zone. There's all these different places where you can go and hang out with people who think like you, and I don't know if that's necessarily good for us. That doesn't satisfy my definition of what humanity is, just hanging out with people who feel the same way that you do. So yeah, I'm spending a lot more time on Reddit, weirdly, and not because of this. I just find myself there more often now because it's a place that feels like a community that doesn't have any kind of bizarre ideological pull.\nZoë Schiffer: Meanwhile, I'm just in here with ChatGPT talking to my AI friend.\nMichael Calore: How's the parenting going?\nLauren Goode: How's the sleep training?\nMichael Calore: Is your child calling it mommy yet?\nZoë Schiffer: Oh my God, it's so dark.\nMichael Calore: Okay, well, let's take another break, but stick around because we'll be right back with more Uncanny Valley. All right, friends, the internet is a big place, and I know it takes us down many strange paths. So I would like to know, what is your last rabbit hole? What's the last thing that you went deep on on the internet? What brought you there? Where did you go? How did it turn out? Zoë, let's go to you first.\nZoë Schiffer: The thing that's been on my mind, which is very closely related to what we were just talking about, is whether to stay on Threads. I honestly feel like exhausted even thinking about this. It's kind of a natural shift that has already happened where I am just spending a lot more time on Bluesky because it's more fun and more of my peers are there. So it feels like a more vibrant conversation. But over the past two years, I've made the decision to leave Twitter. I've made the decision to leave Substack in a previous job along with my colleague. Now I'm looking at Threads, and I feel kind of this fatigue of like, am I just going to keep issuing purity tests to these companies that they then fail? Or is it like we do have a real moral imperative to look at where we are spending our time, how we are helping these companies, and whether it makes sense to continue investing our time, energy, and content on platforms that are hostile to our work? But I'm curious what you both think of this, Lauren, I just know you've been waiting for this.\nLauren Goode: Rubs hands together, continues the conversation about Meta. I'm not really on Threads anymore. The account still exists, but I haven't used it in, I don't know, a few weeks at least. I, too, am all in on Bluesky, and I respect that you've gone down this rabbit hole. It's important to think about. There's only so much that we can do individually, but that ends up being a collective action if a bunch of people leave something,\nMichael Calore: I was never really on Threads, so that's an easy one for me. But Instagram is a harder one. I'm conflicted about Instagram because I need it for my side hustle, which is music. If you want to book shows, if you want to connect with other like-minded musicians, Instagram is where that's all happening, and I don't see that changing. So I haven't really decided what to do there yet.\nLauren Goode: Especially during the recent LA wildfires. I got a lot of solid information from Instagram about that. Reading the LA Times through Instagram, seeing people's firsthand accounts, and videos that they were capturing. Let's assume those were not altered or AI generated. I don't believe that they were. Even locally, here in San Francisco, seeing what people were doing to collect donations, and food, and clothing items, and stuff like that, just local actions that people were taking that I ended up participating in, it was really useful for that.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I feel like Lauren, you maybe made this calculation on one of our other podcasts where it's like, to the extent that the platforms are serving us, sure, stay, use it. When we begin serving them more than they're serving us, then maybe we make a decision about whether to stay or whether to go.\nLauren Goode: That's exactly it. Do you miss Twitter at all?\nZoë Schiffer: I never had the experience that Mike describes often on here where it really... Mike, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems like you had a real sense of community on Twitter that was enjoyable, and nice, and a fun place to hang out. I really felt like it was a pretty stressful place for me. That said, I felt like I got a lot of opportunities from having a somewhat sizable Twitter following. So yeah, it's kind of painful to walk away. I've not found another platform where I used it in kind of the manic dedicated way that I did with X and Twitter. It felt like that decision was a bigger decision to just step back from social media.\nMichael Calore: It was the place where all my friends were for maybe three or four years, and then it stopped feeling like that, but I stuck around, and now I'm gone.\nZoë Schiffer: Yep. Lauren, what's your rabbit hole?\nLauren Goode: My rabbit hole is no buy 2025.\nMichael Calore: No buy.\nLauren Goode: From AI shopping assistance to no buying.\nMichael Calore: Wait, is this the part of the podcast where you gas up Facebook, buy nothing groups?\nLauren Goode: No, but I will say Facebook Marketplace is sometimes the thing that draws me back into that app, if anything at all.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: No. So I'll admit that it started from a place of fervent consumerism, which is that I want to buy a new couch, and I've been doing this thing where every time I go over a friend's house recently, I sit on their couch and I'm like, \"What couch is this? Do you like it? How deep is this? Is this 41 inch deep?\" I'm obsessed with couches. So I started looking for couches and I was getting so obsessed with it that I had to take a step back, and then it was like the TikTokers found me, the no buy 2025 girlies appeared in my peripheral vision. They were like, \"Don't buy.\"\nZoë Schiffer: Is it like a finance thing? You're not buying for a budgeting reason or it's like a movement?\nLauren Goode: It's both. It's both for financial reasons, because the girlies are telling... I shouldn't, sorry. The girlies is what we're referred to affectionately as the women on TikTok, and they call themselves that. But they tend to be tallying up, \"Here's how much I'll save in 2025 if I don't do this thing.\" But it's also part of an anti-consumerism movement, broadly, and it's not new, but now it has a nice ring to it, right? Don't buy 2020. It's part of a new year's resolution, basically. No new shoes, unless I have completely worn through the other ones. Or I'm not going to buy any new health and beauty products unless I do something throughout the week that gives me a $50 allotment that I can spend on anything. Everyone can create their own rules, but it's budgeting, but it's fun budgeting.\nZoë Schiffer: I like it.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: That's great.\nLauren Goode: I'm really enjoying that. Yeah. I'm not sure I'm going to do it, but I'm enjoying the hashtag content. What about you, Mike?\nMichael Calore: My rabbit hole is pens. I'm serious.\nZoë Schiffer: You always have the best answers.\nMichael Calore: Okay, so I've been a reporter pretty much my entire adult life, and one of the first things that I learned from my very first editor is that you always carry a pen with you. So I do. I always carry a pen with me. Lauren knows this. I'm pretty fanatical about my devotion towards Fisher Space Pens. If you know the Bullet Space pen, it's very small. It fits in your pocket without bulging or anything, and when you post it, when you pull the cap off and put it on the end, it's a full-size pen. It can go through the wash. You can leave it in a car that's super hot, you can freeze it. It's not going to explode because it has this pressurized ink thing in it. So I traveled at the beginning of January. I went to Las Vegas for CES. God help me. I had my space pen in my pocket. I used it, but it kept falling apart. I think it's so old that it's just not really holding together anymore. I got tired of picking up all the little pieces off the floor. So laying in bed one night, I was like, \"I need a new Space pen.\" I went to my favorite pen shop on the internet, which is Jet Pens, and I started researching other small pens, and I found five or six that I really like.

So I do. I always carry a pen with me. Lauren knows this. I'm pretty fanatical about my devotion towards Fisher Space Pens. If you know the Bullet Space pen, it's very small. It fits in your pocket without bulging or anything, and when you post it, when you pull the cap off and put it on the end, it's a full-size pen. It can go through the wash. You can leave it in a car that's super hot, you can freeze it. It's not going to explode because it has this pressurized ink thing in it. So I traveled at the beginning of January. I went to Las Vegas for CES. God help me. I had my space pen in my pocket. I used it, but it kept falling apart. I think it's so old that it's just not really holding together anymore. I got tired of picking up all the little pieces off the floor. So laying in bed one night, I was like, \"I need a new Space pen.\" I went to my favorite pen shop on the internet, which is Jet Pens, and I started researching other small pens, and I found five or six that I really like.

    "content_text": "About a year ago, security researcher Sam Curry bought his mother a Subaru, on the condition that, at some point in the near future, she let him hack it.\nIt took Curry until last November, when he was home for Thanksgiving, to begin examining the 2023 Impreza's internet-connected features and start looking for ways to exploit them. Sure enough, he and a researcher working with him online, Shubham Shah, soon discovered vulnerabilities in a Subaru web portal that let them hijack the ability to unlock the car, honk its horn, and start its ignition, reassigning control of those features to any phone or computer they chose.\nMost disturbing for Curry, though, was that they found they could also track the Subaru's location—not merely where it was at the moment but also where it had been for the entire year that his mother had owned it. The map of the car’s whereabouts was so accurate and detailed, Curry says, that he was able to see her doctor visits, the homes of the friends she visited, even which exact parking space his mother parked in every time she went to church.\n“You can retrieve at least a year's worth of location history for the car, where it's pinged precisely, sometimes multiple times a day,” Curry says. “Whether somebody's cheating on their wife or getting an abortion or part of some political group, there are a million scenarios where you could weaponize this against someone.”\nCurry and Shah today revealed in a blog post their method for hacking and tracking millions of Subarus, which they believe would have allowed hackers to target any of the company's vehicles equipped with its digital features known as Starlink in the US, Canada, or Japan. Vulnerabilities they found in a Subaru website intended for the company's staff allowed them to hijack an employee's account to both reassign control of cars’ Starlink features and also access all the vehicle location data available to employees, including the car’s location every time its engine started, as shown in their video below.\nCurry and Shah reported their findings to Subaru in late November, and Subaru quickly patched its Starlink security flaws. But the researchers warn that the Subaru web vulnerabilities are just the latest in a long series of similar web-based flaws they and other security researchers working with them have found that have affected well over a dozen carmakers, including Acura, Genesis, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Kia, Toyota, and many others. There’s little doubt, they say, that similarly serious hackable bugs exist in other auto companies' web tools that have yet to be discovered.\nIn Subaru's case, in particular, they also point out that their discovery hints at how pervasively those with access to Subaru's portal can track its customers' movements, a privacy issue that will last far longer than the web vulnerabilities that exposed it. “The thing is, even though this is patched, this functionality is still going to exist for Subaru employees,” Curry says. “It's just normal functionality that an employee can pull up a year's worth of your location history.”\nWhen WIRED reached out to Subaru for comment on Curry and Shah's findings, a spokesperson responded in a statement that “after being notified by independent security researchers, [Subaru] discovered a vulnerability in its Starlink service that could potentially allow a third party to access Starlink accounts. The vulnerability was immediately closed and no customer information was ever accessed without authorization.”\nThe Subaru spokesperson also confirmed to WIRED that “there are employees at Subaru of America, based on their job relevancy, who can access location data.\" The company offered as an example that employees have that access to share a vehicle's location with first responders in the case when a collision is detected. “All these individuals receive proper training and are required to sign appropriate privacy, security, and NDA agreements as needed,” Subaru's statement added. “These systems have security monitoring solutions in place which are continually evolving to meet modern cyber threats.”\nResponding to Subaru's example of notifying first responders about a collision, Curry notes that would hardly require a year's worth of location history. The company didn't respond to WIRED asking how far back it keeps customers' location histories and makes them available to employees.\nShah and Curry's research that led them to the discovery of Subaru's vulnerabilities began when they found that Curry's mother's Starlink app connected to the domain SubaruCS.com, which they realized was an administrative domain for employees. Scouring that site for security flaws, they found that they could reset employees' passwords simply by guessing their email address, which gave them the ability to take over any employee's account whose email they could find. The password reset functionality did ask for answers to two security questions, but they found that those answers were checked with code that ran locally in a user's browser, not on Subaru's server, allowing the safeguard to be easily bypassed. “There were really multiple systemic failures that led to this,” Shah says.\nThe two researchers say they found the email address for a Subaru Starlink developer on LinkedIn, took over the employee's account, and immediately found that they could use that staffer's access to look up any Subaru owner by last name, zip code, email address, phone number, or license plate to access their Starlink configurations. In seconds, they could then reassign control of the Starlink features of that user's vehicle, including the ability to remotely unlock the car, honk its horn, start its ignition, or locate it, as shown in the video below.\nThose vulnerabilities alone, for drivers, present serious theft and safety risks. Curry and Shah point out that a hacker could have targeted a victim for stalking or theft, looked up someone's vehicle's location, then unlocked their car at any time—though a thief would have to somehow also use a separate technique to disable the car's immobilizer, the component that prevents it from being driven away without a key.\nThose car hacking and tracking techniques alone are far from unique. Last summer, Curry and another researcher, Neiko Rivera, demonstrated to WIRED that they could pull off a similar trick with any of millions of vehicles sold by Kia. Over the prior two years, a larger group of researchers, of which Curry and Shah are a part, discovered web-based security vulnerabilities that affected cars sold by Acura, BMW, Ferrari, Genesis, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Rolls Royce, and Toyota.\nMore unusual in Subaru's case, Curry and Shah say, is that they were able to access fine-grained, historical location data for Subarus going back at least a year. Subaru may in fact collect multiple years of location data, but Curry and Shah tested their technique only on Curry's mother, who had owned her Subaru for about a year.\nCurry argues that Subaru's extensive location tracking is a particularly disturbing demonstration of the car industry's lack of privacy safeguards around its growing collection of personal data on drivers. “It's kind of bonkers,” he says. “There's an expectation that a Google employee isn't going to be able to just go through your emails in Gmail, but there's literally a button on Subaru's admin panel that lets an employee view location history.”\nThe two researchers’ work contributes to a growing sense of concern over the enormous amount of location data that car companies collect. In December, information a whistleblower provided to the German hacker collective the Chaos Computer Computer and Der Spiegel revealed that Cariad, a software company that partners with Volkswagen, had left detailed location data for 800,000 electric vehicles publicly exposed online. Privacy researchers at the Mozilla Foundation in September warned in a report that “modern cars are a privacy nightmare,” noting that 92 percent give car owners little to no control over the data they collect, and 84 percent reserve the right to sell or share your information. (Subaru tells WIRED that it “does not sell location data.”)\n“While we worried that our doorbells and watches that connect to the internet might be spying on us, car brands quietly entered the data business by turning their vehicles into powerful data-gobbling machines,” Mozilla's report reads.\nCurry and Shah's discovery of Subaru's security vulnerabilities in its tracking demonstrate a particularly egregious exposure of that data—but also a privacy problem that's hardly less disturbing now that the vulnerabilities are patched, says Robert Herrell, the executive director of the Consumer Federation of California, which has sought to create legislation for limiting car's data tracking.\n“It seems like there are a bunch of employees at Subaru that have a scary amount of detailed information,” Herrell says. “People are being tracked in ways that they have no idea are happening.”\nUpdate 4:23 pm EST, January 23, 2025: The article's subheadline has been updated to clarify the scope of the researcher's work.",

    "content_text": "Over the weekend, I went to DC to meet with all of the right-wing influencers and content creators who made President Donald Trump’s 2024 win possible. They were everywhere.\nThe 2024 election was the influencer election and inauguration was no different: There were dozens of pre- and post-inaugural parties and balls this weekend, as well as the big event itself. Theo Von sat in front of Jake and Logan Paul under the Capitol rotunda (well, until the podcaster’s chair collapsed). Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, and Brett Cooper walked the Turning Point USA red carpet and posed for selfies with fans. Jessic Reed Kraus, writer of the HouseInhabit newsletter, hung out with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the Make America Healthy Again ball Monday night.\nIn August, I published a guide on the Republican and Democratic influencers shaping the 2024 election. The influencers and content creators still matter, and they will be communicating and guiding policy decisions for years to come.\nWelcome to Trump 2.0, where these creators have the ears not only of their audiences but of the president as well. Here are some of the ones to keep an eye on over the next four years.\nThe Podcasters and Streamers\nThe 2024 election was the breakout cycle for podcasters in politics. Most of the shows Trump went on catered to the manosphere, a loose network of creators who push misogynistic, racist, and pro-male ideology online. This includes people like Joe Rogan, Andrew Schulz, the Paul brothers, and Adin Ross, who shared their Trump interviews with millions and millions of their fans. There’s a second branch too, made up of creators who have branded themselves as the intellectual wing of the modern Republican party, like Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, and Lex Fridman. Fridman’s YouTube podcast reaches millions of viewers every week. Shapiro’s show is one of the most popular ones on Spotify.\nThese podcasters have amplified Trump and his agenda with very little, if any, pushback. They will likely be key in rallying support for Trump administration decisions.\nI spoke briefly with Shapiro on Sunday night, asking what comes next for the GOP and podcasting. “The power continues to grow,” he said. “Legacy media's completely blown itself out. We're focused on expanding, not only our brand, but there's so many other brands that need expansion, I think that it's gonna be a very rich time for the podcast industry.”\nThe Meme Pages\nDC Draino, the Typical Liberal, RagingAmericans, and Snowflaketears are some of the largest pro-MAGA meme pages on Instagram. Combined, these accounts have over 6 million followers. They act as conduit between GOP leadership priorities and platforms like X and Instagram.\nThink of their accounts as news aggregators for people who otherwise may not be consuming it.\nThe Organizers\nWhile the Democrats worked with influencers over the last election cycle too, no PAC or campaign organized them as effectively and efficiently as the right. Because of Turning Point USA and its leader, Charlie Kirk, many of the GOP’s most popular creators see each other at least a few times a year at the organization’s summits and trainings. According to interviews with some of the right’s top organizers, that infrastructure is only going to grow over the next four years. The organizers themselves have also become influencers to watch.\nI wrote about an influencer party (and victory lap) hosted over Inauguration weekend that was put on by CJ Pearson and Raquel Debono. Pearson, a conservative creator with more than 500,000 X followers, cochairs the Republican National Committee’s youth advisory council. He’s played a key role in the party’s adoption of influencers and is planning additional trainings with organizations like the Heritage Foundation.\nDebono, the chief marketing officer at Date Right, the conservative dating platform, boasts tens of thousands of followers of her own. More importantly, however, she’s become the premiere party host for young people on the right, engineering a fratty, downtown club scene for young Republicans. Trump campaign adviser Alex Bruesewitz was key in striking many of the creator partnerships that won Trump millions of views.\nThese events and collabs not only teach creators how to better communicate their values, but define the cultural vibe and set the tone for right-wing content.\nThe Substackers\nMemes and three-hour podcast interviews are powerful tools, but they’re not for everyone. For some audiences, including older ones, reading is their favorite means of consuming information. Substack has found a home with these users, replacing the 2000s political blogosphere.\nJessica Reed Kraus runs the HouseInhabit Substack, which touts nearly 500,000 subscribers. Throughout the 2024 election cycle, she aligned herself closely with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Make America Healthy Again movement. She’s become one of the most influential right-leaning writers who primarily caters to women.\nAnd there’s Curtis Yarvin, the techno monarchist philosopher king of Substack. Yarvin threw his own inauguration weekend party that drew “2016-era MAGA figures” like Jack Posobiec and Red Scare podcasters Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova. Yarvin’s influence among the powerful Silicon Valley oligarchs and the irony-poisoned former leftists like Nekrasova positions him as a powerful intellectual and cultural force under the new administration–especially since Vice President JD Vance is a fan of his work.\nAll of these creators and influencers, regardless of their platform, will be an instrumental part of the Trump White House’s media apparatus. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has even suggested that they may be invited to join the legacy media for daily press briefings. Unlike traditional journalists, though, they are not bound to any ethical guidelines. We’ve already seen the lengths to which many of these people will go for views. How far will they go for Trump?\nThe Chatroom\nSo much happened this week. The Department of Government Efficiency is now a real thing. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined other artificial intelligence leaders to announce a new $500 billion project called Stargate at the White House on Tuesday. More than 1,500 January 6 insurrectionists received pardons or sentence commutations.\nWhat struck you the most? What are you worried about? Does anything excite you?\nYou can leave a comment or send your thoughts to mail@wired.com.\nWIRED Reads\nThe Menswear Guy on What’s Now and What’s Next for the MAGA Aesthetic: My colleague Vittoria Elliott spoke with Derek Guy, the popular menswear influencer on X, critiquing the fits tech execs like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk wore to the inauguration on Monday.\nA Capitol Rioter’s Son Is Terrified About His Father’s Release: On day one, Trump pardoned and commuted the sentences of nearly 1,600 individuals involved in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Jackson Reffitt, who reported his father’s involvement in the attack to the FBI, now lives in fear of what his father might do next.\nHow Meta Tried to Lure TikTok Users to Instagram: In the days before TikTok was set to go dark, Meta ran a ton of ads and released a flood of new features to win over the embattled app’s user base.\nWant more?

We're focused on expanding, not only our brand, but there's so many other brands that need expansion, I think that it's gonna be a very rich time for the podcast industry.”</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">The Meme Pages</h2><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>DC Draino, the Typical Liberal, RagingAmericans, and Snowflaketears</strong> are some of the largest pro-MAGA meme pages on Instagram. Combined, these accounts have over 6 million followers. They act as conduit between GOP leadership priorities and platforms like X and Instagram.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Think of their accounts as news aggregators for people who otherwise may not be consuming it.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">The Organizers</h2><p class=\"paywall\">While the Democrats worked with influencers over the last election cycle too, no PAC or campaign organized them as effectively and efficiently as the right. Because of Turning Point USA and its leader, <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong>, many of the GOP’s most popular creators see each other at least a few times a year at the organization’s summits and trainings. According to interviews with some of the right’s top organizers, that infrastructure is only going to grow over the next four years. The organizers themselves have also become influencers to watch.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/maga-influencers-inauguration-victory-lap/\">an influencer party (and victory lap) hosted over Inauguration weekend</a> that was put on by <strong>CJ Pearson</strong> and <strong>Raquel Debono</strong>. Pearson, a conservative creator with more than 500,000 X followers, cochairs the Republican National Committee’s youth advisory council. He’s played a key role in the party’s adoption of influencers and is planning additional trainings with organizations like the Heritage Foundation.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "He’s not a famous name in the wider world, but copyright lawyer Mark Lemley is equal parts revered and feared within certain tech circles. TechDirt recently described him as a “Lebron James/Michael Jordan”-level legal thinker. A professor at Stanford, counsel at an IP-focused law firm in the Bay Area, and one of the 10 most-cited legal scholars of all time, Lemley is exactly the kind of person Silicon Valley heavyweights want on their side. Meta, however, has officially lost him.\nEarlier this month, Lemley announced he was no longer going to defend the tech giant in Kadrey v. Meta, a lawsuit filed by a group of authors who allege the tech giant violated copyright law by training its AI tools on their books without their permission. The fact that he quit is a big deal. I wondered if it had something to do with how the case was going—but then I checked social media.\nLemley said on LinkedIn and Bluesky that he still believes Meta should win the lawsuit, and he wasn’t bowing out because of the merits of the case. Instead, he’d “fired” Meta because of what he characterized as the company and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s “descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness.” The move came on the heels of major policy shifts at Meta, including changes to its hateful conduct rules that now allow users to call gay and trans people “mentally ill.”\nIn a phone conversation, Lemley explained what motivated his decision to quit, and where he sees the broader legal landscape on AI and copyright going, including his suspicion that OpenAI may settle with The New York Times.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nKate Knibbs: Could you go into more detail about how you arrived at your decision to quit representing Meta? What was the deciding factor?\nMark Lemley: I am very troubled by the direction in which the country is going, and I am particularly troubled that a number of folks in the tech industry seem to be willing to go along with it, no matter how extreme it gets. A number of policy changes struck me as things that I would not personally want to be associated with, from the full-throated endorsement of Trump, to the systematic cutting-back on protections for LGBTQ people, to the elimination of DEI programs. All of this is a pattern, I think, that seems to be following what we saw with Elon Musk a couple of years ago. We've seen where that path leads, and it's not somewhere good. Mark Zuckerberg is, of course, free to do whatever he wants to do, but I decided that that wasn't something I wanted to be associated with.\nDid Meta make an effort to keep you? Did Zuckerberg say anything to you?\nI’ve not had any conversation with Mark Zuckerberg, ever. But any internal conversations that were had is something I probably should not talk about.\nEspecially right now, it’s apparent that Zuckerberg isn’t the only tech mogul aligning himself with Trump. As you mentioned, Elon Musk comes to mind. But there are a lot of very powerful people in Silicon Valley who are pivoting hard towards MAGA policies. Do you have a list, now, of people you’d say no to representing? How are you approaching this?\nI did think Zuckerberg and Musk have been particularly egregious in their behavior. But one of the nice things about being in the position I'm in—having a full-time job teaching rather than practicing law—is that I have probably greater freedom than a lot of people to say I don't need to take that money. Do I have a list? No, absolutely not.\nBut if you decide that the thing to do with your brand is to associate it with moves towards fascism, that is a decision that ought to have consequences. One of the challenges that a lot of people have is they don't feel that they can speak up, because it's going to cost them personally. So I think it's all the more important for people who can bear that cost to do so.\nWhat has the reaction been like?\nWhen I made this as a personal decision, I decided I should say something about it on social media, both because I thought it was important to explain why I was doing it, and also to explain that it wasn't a function of anything in the case, or my views about the case. I had no idea what I was in for, in terms of the reaction. It's been quite remarkable and overwhelmingly positive. There are plenty of trolls who think I'm an idiot and a libtard. But so far, no death threats, which is a welcome improvement from the past.\nHave you heard from people who might follow in your footsteps?\nThis struck such a nerve, and there are obviously a lot of people who feel that they don't have the power to tell Meta or anyone else to go away, or to stand up for things that they think, and that's unfortunate.\nI know your position remains that Meta is still on the right in its AI copyright disputes. But are there any cases in which you think the plaintiffs have a stronger argument?\nThe strongest arguments are the ones where the output of a work ends up being substantially similar to a particular copyrighted input. Most of the time, when that happens, it happens by accident or because they didn't do a good enough job trying to fix the problems that lead to it. But sometimes, it might be unavoidable. Turns out, it’s hard to purge all references to Mickey Mouse from your AI dataset, for instance. If people want to try to generate a Mickey Mouse image, it's often possible to do something that looks like Mickey Mouse. So there are a set of issues that might create copyright problems, but they're mostly not the ones currently being litigated.\nThe one exception to that is the UMG v. Anthropic case, because at least early on, earlier versions of Anthropic would generate the song lyrics for songs in the output. That's a problem. The current status of that case is they've put safeguards in place to try to prevent that from happening, and the parties have sort of agreed that, pending the resolution of the case, those safeguards are sufficient, so they're no longer seeking a preliminary injunction.\nAt the end of the day, the harder question for the AI companies is not is it legal to engage in training? It’s what do you do when your AI generates output that is too similar to a particular work?\nDo you expect the majority of these cases to go to trial, or do you see settlements on the horizon?\nThere may well be some settlements. Where I expect to see settlements is with big players who either have large swaths of content or content that's particularly valuable. The New York Times might end up with a settlement, and with a licensing deal, perhaps where OpenAI pays money to use New York Times content.\nThere's enough money at stake that we're probably going to get at least some judgments that set the parameters. The class-action plaintiffs, my sense is they have stars in their eyes. There are lots of class actions, and my guess is that the defendants are going to be resisting those and hoping to win on summary judgment. It's not obvious that they go to trial. The Supreme Court in the Google v. Oracle case nudged fair-use law very strongly in the direction of being resolved on summary judgment, not in front of a jury. I think the AI companies are going to try very hard to get those cases decided on summary judgment.\nWhy would it be better for them to win on summary judgment versus a jury verdict?\nIt's quicker and it's cheaper than going to trial. And AI companies are worried that they're not going to be viewed as popular, that a lot of people are going to think, Oh, you made a copy of the work that should be illegal and not dig into the details of the fair-use doctrine.\nThere have been lots of deals between AI companies and media outlets, content providers, and other rights holders. Most of the time, these deals appear to be more about search than foundational models, or at least that’s how it’s been described to me. In your opinion, is licensing content to be used in AI search engines—where answers are sourced by retrieval augmented generation or RAG—something that’s legally obligatory? Why are they doing it this way?\nIf you're using retrieval augmented generation on targeted, specific content, then your fair-use argument gets more challenging. It's much more likely that AI-generated search is going to generate text taken directly from one particular source in the output, and that's much less likely to be a fair use. I mean, it could be—but the risky area is that it’s much more likely to be competing with the original source material. If instead of directing people to a New York Times story, I give them my AI prompt that uses RAG to take the text straight out of that New York Times story, that does seem like a substitution that could harm the New York Times. Legal risk is greater for the AI company.\nWhat do you want people to know about the generative AI copyright fights that they might not already know, or they might have been misinformed about?\nThe thing that I hear most often that's wrong as a technical matter is this concept that these are just plagiarism machines. All they're doing is taking my stuff and then grinding it back out in the form of text and responses. I hear a lot of artists say that, and I hear a lot of lay people say that, and it's just not right as a technical matter. You can decide if generative AI is good or bad. You can decide it's lawful or unlawful. But it really is a fundamentally new thing we have not experienced before. The fact that it needs to train on a bunch of content to understand how sentences work, how arguments work, and to understand various facts about the world doesn't mean it's just kind of copying and pasting things or creating a collage. It really is generating things that nobody could expect or predict, and it's giving us a lot of new content. I think that's important and valuable.",

    "content_text": "When I walk into Jen Easterly’s office on a bright January day in Arlington, Virginia, I’m greeted by a giant shark head lurking on the floor. I instantly spot a Rubik’s Cube—an Easterly hallmark—emblazoned with the logo of the organization she’s run for the past three and a half years—the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which President Donald Trump created during his first term.\nEasterly, who is 56 years old, jumps to her feet to greet me. The first thing that hits me is her denim pants, which have a dragon on one leg and a serpent on the other. Then she launches into updates on CISA’s animated “Secure Our World” video series and, in the same breath, laments that she hasn’t had time for a private guitar lesson in weeks. Seemingly a regular day on the job for her, except for one thing. As of January 20, Inauguration Day, Easterly’s time at CISA would be over. Trump had fired the agency’s first director, Chris Krebs, after CISA refused to question the integrity of the 2020 election, and Easterly now says she wasn’t asked to stay. Rumors are swirling that CISA programs—or even the entire agency—may soon be on Trump’s chopping block.\nThe timing couldn’t be worse for the nation to lose its top cybersecurity cop. A Beijing-linked group called Salt Typhoon spent months last year rampaging through American telecoms and siphoning call logs, recordings, text messages, and even potentially location data. Many experts have called it the biggest hack in US telecom history. Easterly and her agency unknowingly detected Salt Typhoon activity in federal networks early last year—warning signs that ultimately sped up the unraveling of the espionage campaign.\nThe work of banishing Chinese spies from victim networks isn’t over, but the walls are already closing in on CISA. Trump's nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, told a senate committee last week that CISA needs to be “smaller” and “more nimble.” And a day after the inauguration, all members of the Cyber Safety Review Board—who were appointed by Easterly and were actively investigating the Salt Typhoon breaches—were let go.\nWhen Easterly officially became the agency’s second director, in 2021, the government was still reeling from a different blockbuster hack—SolarWinds. Kremlin-backed intruders had compromised widely used software to infiltrate the networks of US agencies and other targets. Helping US institutions defend themselves became an even more urgent and daunting project. CISA doesn’t enforce laws or collect intelligence; its job is to evangelize digital security measures and offer free services, so institutions can see what they need to do to not get hacked or—more realistically—get hacked less badly. Easterly got to work building relationships across the federal government and with state and local officials, corporate executives, and utility managers. In crises like the Salt Typhoon campaign, these relationships are crucial to quickly containing the damage.\nIt takes a determined person, and perhaps a charismatic one, to build rapport with such a wide-ranging group of people. Easterly has the background for it: She has worked in the Army (with multiple deployments), the National Security Agency, and the National Security Council under Barack Obama, and she spent nearly five years in charge of Morgan Stanley’s global cybersecurity. She also helped establish US Cyber Command within the Department of Defense. Somehow, though, she’s chill. To break the ice, and probably to make an impression, Easterly has leaned into her passions while in office, cubing and jamming with executives and utility operators around the country. And, yes, there’s her eclectic style—high fashion (by cybersecurity standards, anyway) mixed with bell-bottoms and Birkenstocks—but also her quiet, intense obsession with trying to solve the puzzle that is digital defense.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity, combining on-camera and off-camera portions. Check out WIRED’s YouTube channel for the video.\nYou’re in your last days as the director of CISA. How's it going?\nIt's a little bittersweet.\nWhy are you leaving?\nWell, at the end of the day, I'm a Senate-confirmed political appointee. We serve at the pleasure of the president. I've not been asked to stay.\nThere are signs that the Trump administration may be hostile to some of CISA’s goals. Do you think the agency has proven it's valuable?\nWe are America's cyberdefense agency, but our budget is less than $3 billion. I think the American people are getting an incredible return on investment. Anybody who looks at it will see that there's been an enormous amount of progress made in reducing risk to the critical infrastructure Americans rely on every hour of every day. We're talking water, power, transportation, communication, finance. It's not a political or partisan issue, and these threats are only getting more complicated, more dangerous. Any stepping back of what we've put in place will be to the detriment of the safety and security of the American people.\nOne threat that’s top of mind is Salt Typhoon. How have past foreign espionage campaigns, like Russia’s SolarWinds attacks, informed the work you all are doing?\nWhat we saw in December 2020, with the revelations about the Russian intrusions into US federal government networks, as well as businesses around the world, was a pretty sophisticated supply-chain espionage operation. I would say the bumper sticker was to finally allow CISA to manage the .gov federal digital assets as one enterprise, not as a disparate tribe of a hundred separate departments and agencies. It's still a work in progress, but what we've put in place across the government over the past three and a half years has given us enormous visibility and has allowed us to detect intrusions much more rapidly, to be able to remediate them and to get ahead of future intrusions.\nIt’s concerning how difficult it seems to have been for the telecoms to eradicate the Chinese hackers from their networks. Has there been progress in terms of that transparency and insight you're talking about?\nAfter the revelations of these breaches, we stood up what's called a unified coordination group. So we're responding, the FBI is investigating, folks like the National Security Agency are using what we see in the intelligence to understand the extent and the depth of this intrusion. And we're coming together to work with the victims. We've been doing that for months. This has unfortunately been out in the press a lot—\nI would say fortunately!\nAnything that gets out there has the downside of having adversaries change their tactics. So, while I think the transparency to consumers is important, it also makes it more difficult to then find these actors within the network. I don't expect it to be remediated in the short term.\nWhat about in the long term?\nEverybody should assume that our adversaries, in particular China, are attempting to go after our critical infrastructure. The private sector, they are on the front lines of this fight, because they own and operate the vast majority of our critical infrastructure. It's why companies need to put collaboration over self-preservation.\nI want a future where something like a ransomware attack is a shocking anomaly. Where damaging software vulnerabilities exploited by nation-state actors are as infrequent as plane crashes. A world where the technology that we've come to rely on every hour of every day is first and foremost secure.\nIt feels like hackers always find new ways to get where they want to go. Can you win at defense?\nI mean, you're right. Defense is hard. I say that as America's cyber head goalie. And that's why it has to be a team. As much as we work to hunt for and eradicate Chinese actors, our partners need to hold those actors accountable, whether that's through offensive cyber capabilities or indictments or sanctions. But, yes, we're on the defensive side, and it's a challenge.\nRight now is a very scary and precarious time in cyberspace.\nI spent a lot of time in counterterrorism, and people would often say, “What keeps you up at night?” But it's really not what keeps me up at night. It's all about what gets you up in the morning. I love my team. I love the mission. Not every day is the best day ever, but you work through the issues, you stay resilient, you stay focused.\nProbably a necessary attitude for this type of work. But I just have to be that guy who asks you one more time: What keeps you up at night?\nA major conflict in Asia—the potential invasion or blockade of Taiwan by the People’s Republic of China—could have very real consequences here in the US. You could see pipelines and water being affected, telecommunications being severed, rail lines, power. That is all part of a very deliberate effort by the People’s Republic of China to incite what they call “societal panic” and to deter our ability to marshal military might and citizen will. We have to acknowledge that disruption may occur.\nIs the public paying too much attention to espionage campaigns like Salt Typhoon? Should we all be more worried about threats to critical infrastructure, like China’s Volt Typhoon?\nWe are very focused overall on PRC cyber actors. CISA is one of the few agencies in the government that has been able to find both Volt Typhoon within critical infrastructure as well as Salt Typhoon. In fact, it was our work several months ago to find Salt Typhoon that then led to law enforcement identifying virtual private servers that were being leased by the adversaries, and then that unraveled the wider campaign.\nYou and I have talked before about how Ukraine has faced years of punishing digital attacks and, of course, an ongoing kinetic war with Russia. CISA has partnered for a few years now with its counterpart agency in Ukraine. Do you have concerns that the Trump administration won't prioritize that relationship?\nUkraine is under active assault by a very sophisticated threat actor. What we are learning from how they are dealing with those attacks actually helps us understand and mitigate similar threats to our own infrastructure. Cyber is a borderless space, and what our foreign partners see can absolutely benefit us. We need to ensure that all of us—from the vendors that create technology to companies that buy technology to citizens that consume technology—recognize our shared role in a collective defense of cyberspace and critical infrastructure.\nDo you feel that there are too many cooks in the US federal cybersecurity kitchen? Has that been an issue?\nIt really has not. A lot of people have asked that question, but when the SolarWinds incident occurred I was looking at it as both the cyber policy lead for the Biden-Harris transition team and, perhaps more importantly, from my day job at Morgan Stanley. One advisory came out from CISA that was very SolarWinds-specific. We didn't have SolarWinds in our infrastructure. Another one came from NSA that was focused on VMware, and we did have VMware in our systems. It was not clear how these things were connected. And then you would see an FBI private-sector notice about something else. At this point I've already been in government for 27 years. I'd been in the military, the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, the White House. It's like, I know this. I thought I understood the government. And I couldn't make sense of what the government was trying to tell us about this Russian espionage campaign. It was one of the motivating things about coming to CISA. How do we bring together the federal cyber ecosystem?\nThe relationships with NSA, FBI, and CISA have never been better. Some of that is personalities, but I think we have actually developed institutional connective tissue, so that it will last. It's very, very clear what CISA’s role is. Now, you often talk about, what does the National Security Council do? What does the Office of the National Cyber Director do? I think we've sorted out the relationships at that level with policy and strategy, but really at the operational level where CISA lives, those relationships across the federal cyber ecosystem I think have never been better.\nYou said that there is unfinished business as you prepare to leave CISA. Where do you wish you could have done more?\nThere’s a lot of unfinished business. We have made an impact through our ransomware vulnerability warning pilot and our pre-ransomware notification initiative, and I’m really proud of that, because we work on preventing somebody from having their worst day. But ransomware is still a problem. We have been laser-focused on PRC cyber actors. That will continue to be a huge problem. I'm really proud of where we are, but there's much, much more work to be done. There are things that I think we can continue driving, that the next administration, I hope, will look at, because, frankly, cybersecurity is a national security issue.\nI have to ask you, there are rumors: Are you or are you not going on tour when you leave CISA?\nYou know, I certainly hope to. I played piano and guitar when I was young, but I started taking up electric guitar, and that has become my passion, my obsession. So my big postretirement plan several years from now is to start a bar in lower Manhattan, to have a band. We're going to do magic. We're going to do improv. I'm going to be the bartender.\nAnd will there be Rubik's Cubes at every table?\nThere will be Rubik's Cubes. I'm obsessed with the Rubik's Cube. When I was 11 these things were introduced across the world, and I was a huge puzzler and a video game person. I learned how to solve it, and then I would go to toy stores—I was this little kid with pigtails—and say, “Hey, if I can solve this in less than two minutes, will you give me a free one?” So I was able to amass this whole set of them.\nYou must see some sort of connection between that and your day job.\nErnő Rubik, who invented the thing, said something like, if you are curious, you will find puzzles around you. And if you are determined, you will solve them. And when I think about the incredible technical talent that we have here at CISA, it’s the intellectual curiosity, it’s the hacker mindset, it’s the problem solver. But it's also the determination, the relentless drive to solve the most complicated problems out there.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

Trump had <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/trump-fires-christopher-krebs-cisa/\">fired</a> the agency’s first director, Chris Krebs, after CISA refused to question the integrity of the 2020 election, and Easterly now says she wasn’t asked to stay. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cisa-cuts-trump-2/\">Rumors are swirling</a> that CISA programs—or even <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/14/rand-paul-kneecap-cisa-00189698\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/14/rand-paul-kneecap-cisa-00189698\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/14/rand-paul-kneecap-cisa-00189698\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the entire agency</a>—may soon be on Trump’s chopping block.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The timing couldn’t be worse for the nation to lose its top cybersecurity cop. A Beijing-linked group <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/senators-warn-pentagon-salt-typhoon-china-hacking/\">called Salt Typhoon</a> spent months last year rampaging through American telecoms and siphoning call logs, recordings, text messages, and even potentially location data. Many experts have called it the biggest hack in US telecom history. Easterly and her agency unknowingly detected Salt Typhoon activity in federal networks early last year—warning signs that ultimately sped up the unraveling of the espionage campaign.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">The work of banishing Chinese spies from victim networks isn’t over, but the walls are already closing in on CISA. Trump's nominee to run the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, told a senate committee last week that CISA needs to be “smaller” and “more nimble.” And a day after the inauguration, all members of the Cyber Safety Review Board—who were appointed by Easterly and were actively investigating the Salt Typhoon breaches—were let go.</p><p class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe iDXPAN callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">When Easterly officially <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/biden-cybersecurity-inglis-easterly-cisa-nsa/\">became the agency’s second director</a>, in 2021, the government was still reeling from a different blockbuster hack—<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-untold-story-of-solarwinds-the-boldest-supply-chain-hack-ever/\">SolarWinds</a>. Kremlin-backed intruders had compromised widely used software to infiltrate the networks of US agencies and other targets. Helping US institutions defend themselves became an even more urgent and daunting project. CISA doesn’t enforce laws or collect intelligence; its job is to evangelize digital security measures and offer free services, so institutions can see what they need to do to not get hacked or—more realistically—get hacked less badly. Easterly got to work building relationships across the federal government and with state and local officials, corporate executives, and utility managers. In crises like the Salt Typhoon campaign, these relationships are crucial to quickly containing the damage.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">It takes a determined person, and perhaps a charismatic one, to build rapport with such a wide-ranging group of people. Easterly has the background for it: She has worked in the Army (with multiple deployments), the National Security Agency, and the National Security Council under Barack Obama, and she spent nearly five years in charge of Morgan Stanley’s global cybersecurity. She also helped establish US Cyber Command within the Department of Defense. Somehow, though, she’s chill. To break the ice, and probably to make an impression, Easterly has leaned into her passions while in office, cubing and jamming with executives and utility operators around the country. And, yes, there’s her eclectic style—high fashion (by cybersecurity standards, anyway) mixed with bell-bottoms and Birkenstocks—but also her quiet, intense obsession with trying to solve the puzzle that is digital defense.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity, combining on-camera and off-camera portions.

    "content_text": "This prediction is based on several decades of research that my colleagues and I have been undertaking at the University of Oxford to establish what makes people willing to fight and die for their groups. We use a variety of methods, including interviews, surveys, and psychological experiments to collect data from a wide range of groups, such as tribal warriors, armed insurgents, terrorists, conventional soldiers, religious fundamentalists, and violent football fans.\nWe have found that life-changing and group-defining experiences cause our personal and collective identities to become fused together. We call it “identity fusion.” Fused individuals will stop at nothing to advance the interests of their groups, and this applies not only to acts we would applaud as heroic—such as rescuing children from burning buildings or taking a bullet for one’s comrades—but also acts of suicide terrorism.\nFusion is commonly measured by showing people a small circle (representing you) and a big circle (representing your group) and placing pairs of such circles in a sequence so that they overlap to varying degrees: not at all, then just a little bit, then a bit more, and so on until the little circle is completely enclosed in the big circle. Then people are asked which pair of circles best captures their relationship with the group. People who choose the one in which the little circle is inside the big circle are said to be “fused.” Those are people who love their group so much that they will do almost anything to protect it.\nThis isn’t unique to humans. Some species of birds will feign a broken wing to draw a predator away from their fledglings. One species—the superb fairy wren of Australasia—lures predators away from their young by making darting movements and squeaky sounds to imitate the behavior of a delectable mouse. Humans too will typically go to great lengths to protect their genetic relatives, especially their children who (except for identical twins) share more of their genes than other family members. But—unusually in the animal kingdom—humans often go further still by putting themselves in harm’s way to protect groups of genetically unrelated members of the tribe. In ancient prehistory, such tribes were small enough that everyone knew everybody else. These local groups bonded through shared ordeals such as painful initiations, by hunting dangerous animals together, and by fighting bravely on the battlefield.\nNowadays, however, fusion is scaled up to vastly bigger groups, thanks to the ability of the world’s media—including social media—to fill our heads with images of horrendous suffering in faraway regional conflicts.\nWhen I met with one of the former leaders of the terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiyah in Indonesia, he told me he first became radicalized in the 1980s after reading newspaper reports about the treatment of fellow Muslims by Russian soldiers in Afghanistan. Twenty years later, however, nearly a third of American extremists were radicalized via social media feeds, and by 2016 that proportion had risen to about three quarters. Smartphones and immersive reporting shrinks the world to such an extent that forms of shared suffering in face-to-face groups can now be largely recreated and spread to millions of people across thousands of miles at the click of a button.\nFusion based on shared suffering may be powerful, but is not sufficient by itself to motivate violent extremism. Our research suggests that three other ingredients are also necessary to produce the deadly cocktail: outgroup threat, demonization of the enemy, and the belief that peaceful alternatives are lacking. In regions such as Gaza, where the sufferings of civilians are regularly captured on video and shared around the world, it is only natural that rates of fusion among those watching on in horror will increase. If people believe that peaceful solutions are impossible, violent extremism will spiral.\nSurprisingly, however, a remedy may lie in the fusion mechanism itself. Our research has shown that when Muslim and Jewish participants reflect on the sufferings of the outgroup in the Gaza conflict, this has strikingly positive effects on their attitudes toward each other, despite initial feelings of hostility. Investigations into the fusion mechanism also suggest that it can strengthen over time, when people reflect for weeks and months on their shared experiences of suffering. Consequently, there is still time to prevent my bleak prediction for 2025 from being realized.\nAcknowledging shared suffering on both sides of human conflict is often a pathway to imagining peaceful solutions. But first we need to find better ways of ensuring that more people around the world are exposed to the sufferings of those on the other side of the conflicts they are personally most affected by. This may seem like an impossible task in a world where politics is becoming more divisive, foreign policy more parochial, and social media bubbles more impenetrable. However, recognizing the psychology that compels us toward violent or peaceful outcomes is the first step to a solution. How we manage that psychology in 2025 may profoundly influence the kind of world that future generations inherit.",

    "content_text": "Addressing a single executive order from Donald Trump’s voluminous first-day edicts is like singling out one bullet in a burst from an AK-47. But one of them hit me in the gut. That is “Establishing and Implementing the President’s Department of Government Efficiency.’’ The acronym for that name is DOGE (named after a memecoin), and it’s the Elon Musk–led effort to cut government spending by a trillion bucks or two. Though DOGE was, until this week, pitched as an outside body, this move makes it an official part of government—by embedding it in an existing agency that was formerly part of the Office of Management and Budget called the United States Digital Service. The latter will now be known as the US DOGE Service, and its new head will be more tightly connected to the president, reporting to his chief of staff.\nThe new USDS will apparently shift its former laser focus on building cost-efficient and well-designed software for various agencies to a hardcore implementation of the Musk vision. It’s kind of like a government version of a SPAC, the dodgy financial maneuver that launched Truth Social in the public market without ever having to reveal a coherent business plan to underwriters.\nThe order is surprising in a sense because, on its face, DOGE seems more limited than its original super ambitious pitch. This iteration seems more tightly centered on saving money through streamlining and modernizing the government’s massive and messy IT infrastructure. There are big savings to be had, but a handful of zeros short of trillions. As of yet, it’s uncertain whether Musk will become the DOGE administrator. It doesn’t seem big enough for him. (The first USDS director, Mikey Dickerson, jokingly posted on LinkedIn, “I’d like to congratulate Elon Musk on being promoted to my old job.”) But reportedly Musk pushed for this structure as a way to embed DOGE in the White House. I hear that inside the Executive Office Building, there are numerous pink Post-it notes claiming space even beyond USDS’s turf, including one such note on the former chief information officers’ enviable office. So maybe this could be a launch pad for a more sweeping effort that will eliminate whole agencies and change policies. (I was unable to get a White House representative to answer questions, which isn’t surprising considering that there are dozens of other orders that equally beg for explanation.)\nOne thing is clear—this ends United States Digital Service as it previously existed, and marks a new, and maybe perilous era for the USDS, which I have been enthusiastically covering since its inception. The 11-year-old agency sprang out of the high-tech rescue squad salvaging the mess that was Healthcare.gov, the hellish failure of a website that almost tanked the Affordable Care Act. That intrepid team of volunteers set the template for the agency: a small group of coders and designers who used internet-style techniques (cloud not mainframe; the nimble “agile” programming style instead of the outdated “waterfall” technique) to make government tech as nifty as the apps people use on their phones. Its soldiers, often leaving lucrative Silicon Valley jobs, were lured by the prospect of public service. They worked out of the agency’s funky brownstone headquarters on Jackson Place, just north of the White House. The USDS typically took on projects that were mired in centi-million contracts and never completed—delivering superior results within weeks. It would embed its employees in agencies that requested help, being careful to work collaboratively with the lifers in the IT departments. A typical project involved making DOD military medical records interoperable with the different systems used by the VA. The USDS became a darling of the Obama administration, a symbol of its affiliation with cool nerddom.\nDuring the first Trump administration, deft maneuvering kept the USDS afloat—it was the rare Obama initiative that survived. Its second-in-command, Haley Van Dyck, cleverly got buy-in from Trump’s in-house fixer, Jared Kushner. When I went to meet Kushner for an off-the-record talk early in 2017, I ran into Van Dyck in the West Wing; she gave me a conspiratorial nod that things were looking up, at least for the moment. Nonetheless, the four Trump years became a balancing act in sharing the agency’s achievements while somehow staying under the radar. “At Disney amusement parks, they paint things that they want to be invisible with this certain color of green so that people don't notice it in passing,” one USDSer told me. “We specialized in painting ourselves that color of green.” When Covid hit, that became a feat in itself, as USDS worked closely with White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx on gathering statistics—some of which the administration wasn’t eager to publicize.\nBy the end of Trump’s term, the green paint was wearing thin. A source tells me that at one point a Trump political appointee noticed—not happily—that USDS was recruiting at tech conferences for lesbians and minorities, and asked why. The answer was that it was an effective way to find great product managers and designers. The appointee accepted that but asked if, instead of putting “Lesbians Who Tech” on the reimbursement line, could they just say LWT?\nUnder Biden no subterfuge was needed—the USDS thrived. But despite many months of effort, it could not convince Congress to give it permanent funding. With the return of Trump, and his promises to cut government spending, there was reason to think that USDS would evaporate. That’s why the DOGE move is kind of bittersweet—at least it now has more formal recognition and ostensibly will get a reliable budget line.\nHow will the integration work? The executive order mandates that in addition to normal duties the USDS director will also head a temporary organization “dedicated to advancing the President’s 18-month DOGE agenda.” That agenda is not clearly defined, but elsewhere the order speaks of improving the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, systems, and infrastructure. More specific is the mandate to embed four-person teams inside every agency to help realize the DOGE agenda. The order is very explicit that the agency must provide “full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.” Apparently Musk is obsessed with an unprecedented centralization of the data that makes the government go—or not. This somewhat adversarial stance is a dramatic shift from the old USDS MO of working collegially with the lifers inside the agencies.\nDemanding all that data might be a good thing. Clare Martorana, who until last week was the nation’s chief information officer, says that while she saw many victories during her eight years in government tech, making big changes has been tough, in large part because of the difficulty of getting such vital data. “We have budget data that is incomprehensible,” she says. “The agency understands it, but they hide money in all kinds of places, so no one can really get a 100,000-foot view. How many open positions do they have? What are the skill sets? What are their top contracts? When are they renegotiating their most important contracts? How much do they spend on operations and maintenance versus R&D or innovation? You should know all these things.” If DOGE gets that information and uses it well, it could be transformational. “Through self-reporting, we spend $120 billion on IT,” she says “If we found all the hidden money and shadow IT, it's $200, $300, maybe $500 billion. We lose a lot of money on technology we buy stupidly, and we don't deliver services to the American public that they deserve.” So this Trump effort could be a great thing? “I’m trying very hard to be optimistic about it,” says Martorana. The USDS’s outgoing director, Mina Hsiang, is also trying to be upbeat. “I think there's a tremendous opportunity,” she says. “ I don't know what [DOGE] will do with it, but I hope that they listen to a lot of great folks who are there.”\nOn the other hand, those four-person teams could be a blueprint for mayhem. Up until now, USDS would send only engineers and designers into agencies, and their focus was to build things and hopefully set an example for the full-timers to do work like they do at Google or Amazon. The EO dictates only one engineer in a typical four-person team, joined by a lawyer (not known for building stuff), an HR person (known for firing people), and a “team lead” whose job description sounds like a political enforcer: “implementing the president’s DOGE Agenda.” I know that’s a dark view, but Elon Musk —and his new boss—are no strangers to clearing out a workplace. Maybe they’ll figure AI can do things better.\nWhichever way it goes, the original Obama-era vibes of the USDS may forever be stilled—to be superseded by a different kind of idealist in MAGA garb. As one insider told me, “USDS leadership is pretty ill equipped to navigate the onslaught of these DOGE guys, and they are going to get the shit kicked out of them.” Though not perfect, the USDS has by dint of hard work, mad skills, and corny idealism, made a difference. Was there really a need to embed the DOGE experiment into an agency that was doing good? And what are the odds that on July 4, 2026, when the “temporary” DOGE experiment is due to end, the USDS will sunset as well? At best, the new initiative might help unravel the near intractable train wreck that is government IT. But at worst, the integration will be like a greedy brain worm wreaking havoc on its host.\nTime Travel\nIn August 2014, I chronicled how the health care rescue team morphed into the USDS, attending a recruiting session where US chief technology officer Todd Park courted workers from the Valley’s most glamorous and lucrative companies.\n“We have a window of opportunity—within this government, under this president—to make a huge difference,” Park says.\nPark wants to move government IT into the open source, cloud-based, rapid-iteration environment that is second nature to the crowd considering his pitch tonight. The president has given reformers like him leave, he told them, “to blow everything the fuck up and make it radically better.” This means taking on big-pocketed federal contractors, risk-averse bureaucrats, and politicians who may rail at overruns but thrive on contributions from those benefiting from the waste. It also will require streamlined regulations from both the executive and legislative branches. But instead of picking fights, Park wants to win by showing potential foes the undeniable superiority of a modern approach. He needs these coders to make it happen, to form what he calls a Star Wars-style Rebel Alliance, a network of digital special forces teams. He can’t lure them with stock options, but he does offer a compelling opportunity: a chance to serve their country and improve the lives of millions of their fellow citizens.\n“We’re looking for the best people on the planet,” he said. “We have a window of opportunity—right the fuck now—within this government, under this president, to make a huge difference. Drop everything—and help the United States of America!”\nAsk Me One Thing\nJesse asks, “Now that Trump is all about crypto, will it finally hit the mainstream?”\nThanks for asking, Jesse. We all know that the crypto community went for Trump big-time, a classic case of voting with their wallets. The triumphalist cheers during inauguration weekend reflected their optimism that, with a friend in the White House and the wicked witch of the blockchain—SEC chair Gary Gensler—booted from his post, a golden age of crypto was inevitable. But to date, tough regulation isn’t the biggest reason that crypto hasn’t hit the mainstream. Two factors have held it back. Besides an investment vehicle, it doesn’t have utility for most people. And too many scams have made crypto speculation a risky business.\nSo it was unwelcome, to say the least, that just before the Crypto Ball—the industry’s celebration of its new hero—that same figure kicked the community in the … you know what. Donald Trump signed on to what appears to be a classic memecoin scam, taking 80 percent of the tokens in a new currency called TRUMP coins, for no investment. The 20 percent put up for sale drove the valuation of that tranche to over $14 billion—boosting Trump’s stake to about $50 billion, up from zero—by simply exploiting his popularity (and possibly the chance to win his favor by buying his otherwise useless coins). For good measure, the first lady released her own currency, and the value of the circulating MELANIA coins quickly shot up to $1 billion. Trustworthy investment vehicles do not behave like that, nor do functional currencies. At the moment when the industry is hoping to attain a new level of respectability, the new president is taking advantage of the very flaws in crypto that (understandably) keep the field from prime time.\nIt will now be up to the crypto-friendly Trump administration to come up with regulations that encourage innovation while protecting consumers. If the regulators are really friendly, they will lean towards rigor, not laissez-faire. If their rules permit schemes like TRUMP coins to legally exist, the exercise will be a failure, and mainstream acceptance will have to wait.\nSubmit your questions in the comments below, or send an email to mail@wired.com.

(The first USDS director, Mikey Dickerson, jokingly posted on LinkedIn, “I’d like to congratulate Elon Musk on being promoted to my old job.”) But reportedly <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/21/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/21/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge/\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/21/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Musk pushed for this</a> structure as a way to embed DOGE in the White House. I hear that inside the Executive Office Building, there are numerous pink Post-it notes claiming space even beyond USDS’s turf, including one such note on the former chief information officers’ enviable office. So maybe this could be a launch pad for a more sweeping effort that will eliminate whole agencies and change policies. (I was unable to get a White House representative to answer questions, which isn’t surprising considering that there are dozens of other orders that equally beg for explanation.)</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">One thing <em>is</em> clear—this ends United States Digital Service as it previously existed, and marks a new, and maybe perilous era for the USDS, which I have been enthusiastically covering since its inception. The 11-year-old agency sprang out of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp/\">high-tech rescue squad</a> salvaging the mess that was Healthcare.gov, the hellish failure of a website that almost tanked the Affordable Care Act. That intrepid team of volunteers set the template for the agency: a small group of coders and designers who used internet-style techniques (cloud not mainframe; <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://techfarhub.usds.gov/resources/learning-center/waterfall-vs-agile/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://techfarhub.usds.gov/resources/learning-center/waterfall-vs-agile/\" href=\"https://techfarhub.usds.gov/resources/learning-center/waterfall-vs-agile/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the nimble “agile” programming style</a> instead of the outdated “waterfall” technique) to make government tech as nifty as the apps people use on their phones. Its soldiers, often leaving lucrative Silicon Valley jobs, were lured by the prospect of public service. They worked out of the agency’s funky brownstone headquarters on Jackson Place, just north of the White House. The USDS typically took on projects that were mired in centi-million contracts and never completed—delivering superior results within weeks. It would <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/07/inside-the-obama-tech-surge-as-it-hacks-the-pentagon-and-va/\">embed its employees in agencies</a> that requested help, being careful to work collaboratively with the lifers in the IT departments. A typical project involved making DOD military medical records interoperable with the different systems used by the VA. The USDS became a darling of the Obama administration, a symbol of its affiliation with cool nerddom.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">During the first Trump administration, deft maneuvering kept the USDS afloat—it was the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/01/the-final-days-of-obamas-tech-surge/\">rare Obama initiative</a> that survived. Its second-in-command, Haley Van Dyck, cleverly got buy-in from Trump’s in-house fixer, Jared Kushner. When I went to meet Kushner for an off-the-record talk early in 2017, I ran into Van Dyck in the West Wing; she gave me a conspiratorial nod that things were looking up, at least for the moment. Nonetheless, the four Trump years became a balancing act in sharing the agency’s achievements while somehow staying under the radar. “At Disney amusement parks, they paint things that they want to be invisible with this certain color of green so that people don't notice it in passing,” one USDSer told me. “We specialized in painting ourselves that color of green.” When Covid hit, that became a feat in itself, as USDS worked closely with White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx on gathering statistics—some of which the administration wasn’t eager to publicize.</p><p class=\"paywall\">By the end of Trump’s term, the green paint was wearing thin. A source tells me that at one point a Trump political appointee noticed—not happily—that USDS was recruiting at tech conferences for lesbians and minorities, and asked why. The answer was that it was an effective way to find great product managers and designers. The appointee accepted that but asked if, instead of putting “Lesbians Who Tech” on the reimbursement line, could they just say LWT?</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nAs avian influenza rages through birds and dairy cattle across the United States, Georgia has become the latest state to detect the virus in a commercial poultry flock, and on Friday, it halted all poultry sales to mitigate further spread of the disease. Nationally, egg prices are soaring—if you can find them at all in your local grocery store.\nThe ongoing outbreak in animals has also led to at least 67 human cases of bird flu, with all but one causing mild illness. Earlier this month, a person in Louisiana died after being hospitalized with severe bird flu in December. It’s the country’s first recorded death attributed to H5N1.\nThe US has previously licensed three H5N1 vaccines for humans, but they’re not available commercially. The government has purchased millions of doses for the national stockpile in case they’re needed. But even as the outbreak spread, federal health officials under President Joe Biden were hesitant to deploy them. Experts say the decision comes down to risk, and currently, the risk of H5N1 remains low. Rolling out a vaccine to farm workers and others at higher risk of infection would be a more targeted tactic, but even that measure may be premature. Now, with a changeover in federal health leadership imminent as President Donald Trump begins his second term, the decision rests with the new administration.\n“At the moment, from the point of view of severity and ease of transmission, it does not seem like an imperative to get a vaccine out to protect humans,” says William Schaffner, a physician and professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.\nSo far, no person-to-person spread of H5N1 has been identified, but health officials are monitoring the virus for any genetic changes that would make transmission among people more likely. Most bird flu infections are related to animal exposures. Of the 67 known human cases in the US, 40 have been linked to sick dairy cattle and 23 are associated with poultry farms and culling operations. In the other four cases, the exact source isn’t known.\nIn the US, human cases have been mild, with many of them causing only conjunctivitis. In some cases, people have had mild respiratory symptoms. Aside from the Louisiana patient, all the individuals who tested positive for H5N1 recovered quickly and never needed to be hospitalized. Historically though, H5N1 has been fatal in around 50 percent of cases. Since 2003, a total of 954 cases of human H5N1 have been reported to the World Health Organization, and about half of them died. Egypt, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and China have reported the highest number of human bird flu deaths.\nThose numbers come with a few caveats. For one, many of those deaths occurred in places where people live very close to the sick poultry. “In those circumstances, the thinking is that they likely got a very large dose of the virus,” Schaffner says.\nPlus, the case fatality rate—the proportion of infected people who die from the disease—only takes into consideration known cases, and some cases of H5N1 are no doubt going undetected in part because bird flu symptoms are similar to other respiratory viruses. In the US, language barriers among farm workers, lack of testing, and a reluctance among workers to report that they’re sick are also factors. “We probably miss more cases than we detect, and we’re much more likely to detect a case that’s severe,” says Shira Doron, chief infection control officer for Tufts Medicine in Boston and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center.\nDoron says vaccination is not the only way to protect agricultural workers and other individuals who might come in contact with infected animals. She says providing personal protective equipment to farms, instructing workers on how to use that PPE properly, and educating the public about not going near sick or dying birds should be the main focus right now. The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, manages a national stockpile that has face shields, gloves, respirators, and goggles available to farms that need them. The agency is also making the antiviral drug Tamiflu available to jurisdictions without their own stockpiles to treat symptomatic people with a confirmed or suspected exposure.\nAfter government measures during the Covid pandemic sparked anger and confusion, rolling out a vaccine for H5N1 too soon could do more harm than good. “There are some serious downsides to deploying a vaccine, especially when the risk doesn’t justify it,” Doron says. For instance, if a vaccine would cause side effects in some people who get it, that could erode public trust in the vaccine.\nThat happened in 1976, when President Gerald Ford ordered mass vaccination against swine flu to head off a pandemic. More than 40 million Americans received the vaccine in record time, but the shot caused a slightly increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare form of paralysis that is usually reversible but occasionally fatal. It was a major blow to trust in public health.\nSchaffner says if H5N1 mutates into a form that causes more severe disease or is spread easily from human to human, that should clearly trigger the use of a vaccine.\nBut Elizabeth Strater, national vice president of United Farm Workers, says person-to-person spread may not be obvious. “We understand that federal experts don’t recommend a vaccine program unless there is proof of person-to-person transmission. That said, there are so many cases in farm workers going unreported it may be difficult to determine exactly when that happens. Since farm workers can’t afford to isolate at home when they are infected, they are continuing to work while sick,” she says.\nWhile three H5N1 vaccines are already in the national stockpile, they were approved in 2007, 2013, and 2020, and were formulated to earlier strains of the virus. Two of those three vaccines have shown that they can generate neutralizing antibodies against the current version of the virus in lab studies. In the event that vaccines are needed, manufacturers are also working on shots that match the current strains circulating in birds and dairy cattle. Last week, HHS under President Joe Biden awarded Moderna $590 million to help fast-track the development of an mRNA vaccine, the same technology used in some of the Covid vaccines.\nWhether to use these vaccines will be left up to the Trump administration, and if confirmed, that decision would fall to Trump’s pick for HHS secretary, Robert F. Kennedy. A known vaccine skeptic, Kennedy questioned the need for a human bird flu vaccine on X last July.\nA vaccine for animals may be more politically palatable for the new Trump administration. Bird flu can kill poultry in just a few days, and once it is detected on a farm, entire flocks have to be culled. The Department of Agriculture has a national H5N1 vaccine stockpile for use in commercial poultry and said recently that it will add additional vaccines to it that have been updated for the current strain. US poultry producers have long resisted vaccination over fears that vaccinating birds could trigger bans on exported poultry, spark food safety concerns among consumers, and make it harder to detect bird flu outbreaks, since vaccination may not fully prevent infection.\nResearchers are also working on H5N1 vaccines for cattle. So far, at least seven candidate vaccines have been approved for field safety trials, according to a USDA announcement. Vaccinating cattle may be more feasible than immunizing poultry, as they live longer than commercial poultry, and dairy herds typically number in the hundreds while commercial flocks can have tens to hundreds of thousands of birds. Vaccinating dairy cattle could prevent some human cases of H5N1 but not all of them, since the virus is so widespread in birds and poultry.\n“If we can control, or at least contain, the virus in these reservoir species, then you can prevent the spillover to another species,” says Mahesh Kumar, senior vice president of Zoetis, an animal health company that is developing an H5N1 vaccine for cattle. He thinks the dairy industry will be more open to the idea of vaccination than poultry producers have been. “Dairy cattle are much more expensive,” he says. “There’s a huge impact, economically, for the dairy industry.”\nCorrection: 1/22/2024, 3:48 pm EST: This story has been corrected to properly identify Mahesh Kumar.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nApple's MagSafe technology is my favorite smartphone innovation of the past five years—it has changed how I use my phone. The Qi2 wireless charging standard introduced in 2023 was supposed to bring the same magnetic charging marvels to Android smartphones, as well as enable wider compatibility of accessories between iPhone and Android—which would have been most welcome. Sadly, after two years, there's only a single Qi2 Android phone out right now.\nYou'd think Samsung, in its never-ending quest to outshine Apple, would finally debut Qi2 on its new Galaxy S25 series—announced earlier today—but unfortunately that's not the case. The Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra support the Qi wireless charging standard, however, Samsung says they are “Qi2 Ready.” This is a workaround that brings full Qi2 functionality to these phones via magnetic cases. It's a bit complicated, so let me break it down.\nThe Promise of Qi2\nWe have a Qi2 explainer here, but to boil it down, it's the next stage of wireless charging, and it takes inspiration from Apple's MagSafe charging system. (Apple helped develop the Qi2 standard, and every iPhone since the iPhone 12 is now officially a Qi2 device, excluding the iPhone SE.) A ring of magnets inside a Qi2 phone can magnetically connect with a Qi2 wireless charger, allowing for precise energy transfer that makes wireless charging faster and more efficient.\nMy wife still complains when her Qi phone doesn't charge overnight because she didn't align it juuuust right on the charger. Well, that is not a problem with Qi2, because magnets! Jesse Pinkman said it best.\nThat isn't the only reason I like having magnets in my phone—the MagSafe system has opened up a world of magnetic accessories you can attach to the back of the device. At CES 2025, a part of my content workflow involves using a MagSafe camera cage for my iPhone, which I can magnetically pop on the mount without fussing with a clamp.\nWith every electric scooter and ebike I test, I pop my phone onto Peak Design's magnetic bike mount—an elegant solution far nicer than pulling silicone bands over my phone to keep it secure on the handlebars.\nI also very much enjoy placing my iPhone on my MagSafe car dock. Clamps are annoying, OK? If they weren't, why would accessory maker iOttie sell a car mount that automatically opens the clamps so you don't have to fuss with them? Clamps suck!\nThis is why I desperately want Qi2 to make its way into more Android phones, so I can natively use them with all these magnetic accessories—case or not.\nWhat’s “Qi2 Ready”?\nTwo years is apparently not enough lead time for Samsung to get its act together and add Qi2 to the Galaxy S25, but there's a stopgap measure. A bevy of “Qi2 Ready” cases will add complete Qi2 capabilities to the Galaxy S25. Samsung doesn't have to redesign the phone to add magnets, because the case is doing the hard work. (Qi2 Ready cases will be available from Samsung and third parties.)\nThese Qi2 Ready cases are certified and tested with Qi2 Ready phones so you can be sure that a Galaxy S25 with a Qi2 Ready case will work with a Qi2 charging accessory, whether that's a Qi2 power bank or a Qi2 wireless charger. (How many times can I write Qi2 in a sentence?) Paul Golden, director of marketing at the Wireless Power Consortium, the organization that manages the charging standard, tells me this system enables the same Qi2 charging speed and same energy efficiency. “It's a faster way, an easier way, for a company to offer a Qi2 experience without having to make that big change.”\nThis is important because, while we MagSafe lovers have made do with MagSafe Android phone cases these past few years, there's always been a caveat that these cases may not work with all MagSafe products. With Qi2 Ready cases, you can rest easy knowing they'll work with Qi2 chargers.\nIt's worth noting that OnePlus' latest flagship phone, the OnePlus 13, is not a Qi2 Ready phone, however, OnePlus sells a magnetic case to enable Qi2-like charging. This is the old approach of adding magnetic charging to phones with basic Qi support, and it will not turn your phone into a Qi2 device. While it may feel similar, you may not enjoy faster charging speeds, it will not be as energy efficient, and it's not guaranteed to work with all Qi2 accessories. Golden says Qi2 Ready phones have “special features built into them” to enable proper Qi2 functionality when paired with a Qi2 Ready case.\nAlas, as soon as you take these Qi2 Ready cases off the phone, the magnetic functionality disappears. This may not be a problem for most people. It's hard to find recent statistics, but a 2023 YouGov survey found that roughly 68 percent of Americans use a phone case, and a 2017 study put that number at 79 percent. But it does stink for those of us who don't like using a case. Pour one out for the case-less fiends.\nI can recall dozens of times when I've had to take my iPhone case off to attach a wireless microphone to the USB-C port or to fit the phone on a gimbal. Removing the case didn't change anything because iPhones have magnets built in, but this is something that will impact Qi2 Ready phones, and it's a frustrating limitation.\nI think Qi2 Ready phones are an acceptable in-between measure. Considering it's cheaper than embedding magnets into a phone, I hope it means more budget and midrange smartphones can enjoy Qi2 capabilities.\nStill, I worry that this will make things confusing for the average person. New phones will support Qi but not Qi2, but they'll have Qi2 Ready cases to enable Qi2—my brain hurt just writing that. If they just had native Qi2 support, magnetic charging would work all the time with any Qi2 accessory. Easy peasy.\nThe good news is that Samsung and Google have committed to releasing official Qi2 Android phones in 2025, so it is on the way, though it does feel bizarre that Samsung may not end up debuting it on its flagship smartphone series.\nI'll make do with a magnetic case (again), but for the love of God, can someone just give me my magnetic Android already?",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nSamsung's latest Android smartphones may give you déjà vu. The company showed off the new Galaxy S25 series at its Galaxy Unpacked event today in San Jose, California. Samsung has once again loaded its flagship phones with artificial intelligence capabilities, and while many of those features are tricks we've seen before—even almost a decade ago—they have now been infused with large language models that make them more effective.\nNo, really. One of the Galaxy S25 Ultra's stylus features is being rebranded from “Smart Select” to “AI Select,” and a Samsung executive joked, “Smart Select really wasn't that smart,” highlighting the efficacy of the new multimodal LLMs powering the feature (and the lengths these companies go to make every little feature sound “smart”).\nSamsung also teased another device at the end of its keynote, the Galaxy S25 Edge. It seems to be an ultra-thin version of the Galaxy S25, but outside of a brief image, the company did not share any other details. A Samsung representative says there's nothing else to share at the moment. The S25 Edge would be a direct competitor to the rumored iPhone 17 Air arriving later this year, reigniting the battle for the thinnest phone around.\nCurrently, the Galaxy S25 range is comprised of the Galaxy S25 ($800), Galaxy S25+ ($1,000), and Galaxy S25 Ultra ($1,300). The phones are available for preorder today and will officially go on sale February 7. Here's what's new, including a breakdown of the AI features that were given the spotlight.\nThe Hardware\nThe hardware is not much different from last year's Galaxy S24 series. I still find Samsung's design language rather anemic—these are rectangular slabs with very little flair. Even Apple is doing something different with all the new buttons available on the iPhone 16.\nThe phones go up in size, with the Galaxy S25 being the smallest and the Ultra being the largest. In an annual tradition, the bezels around the screens have been shaved down, and that's how Samsung says the Galaxy S25 Ultra achieved its slightly bigger 6.9-inch screen size despite having close to the same dimensions as its predecessor. The corners of all three phones are rounded now—the Ultra is no longer boxy—though Samsung flattened the edges for a nicer grip.\nSamsung employs Corning's new Gorilla Armor 2 glass on the S25 Ultra, which supposedly has 29 percent better resistance to fractures than the original Gorilla Armor on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Interestingly, Samsung says it saw a 60 percent drop in screen repairs from the S24 over the S23 series, which could mean the S25 is even more durable.\n|Galaxy S25\n|Galaxy S25+\n|Galaxy S25 Ultra\n|Display: 6.2 inches, 120-Hz LTPO, AMOLED\n|6.7 inches, 120-Hz LTPO, AMOLED\n|6.9 inches, 120-Hz LTPO, AMOLED\n|Build: Aluminum, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2\n|Aluminum, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2\n|Titanium, Corning Gorilla Armor 2 (front), Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (back)\n|Processor and RAM: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite and 12 GB of RAM\n|Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite and 12 GB of RAM\n|Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite and 12 GB of RAM\n|Storage: 128, 256, 512 GB\n|256 and 512 GB\n|256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB\n|Battery: 4,000 mAh\n|4,900 mAh\n|5,000 mAh\n|Cameras: 50-MP primary camera, 12-MP ultrawide, 10-MP 3X telephoto, 12-MP selfie\n|50-MP primary camera, 12-MP ultrawide, 10-MP 3X telephoto, 12-MP selfie\n|200-MP primary camera, 50-MP ultrawide, 50-MP 5X telephoto, 10-MP 3X telephoto, 12-MP selfie\n|Updates: 7 years of software updates\n|7 years of software updates\n|7 years of software updates\n|Extras: Non-magnetic Qi 2.1 wireless charging (Qi2 ready with case).

This will be the processor in all Samsung Galaxy S25 series phones globally, unlike prior years when Samsung opted for its own Exynos chips in some markets. Samsung claims this chip offers a 37 percent CPU upgrade, a 30 percent graphics boost, and a 40 percent improved neural processing unit when compared to the S24 series.\nSamsung and Qualcomm collaborated on optimizing the chip, and that close tie has enabled new features like ProScaler. On the S25 Ultra and S25+, this feature can upscale images on the screen to match the display resolution. Say you're browsing Instagram and someone uploaded a 1,080p image—it will be upscaled to QHD+.\nThe vapor chamber cooling system is larger on all three—a crucial component to keep the phones from getting too hot during intense gaming sessions—with the chamber in the S25 Ultra getting a 40 percent size bump. Samsung also says sitting on top of the chip is a new “tailored thermal interface material” that leaves zero gaps for air, pulling heat from the processor directly to the vapor chamber cooling system to increase performance and reduce stress on the battery.\nArguably the most disappointing part of the hardware story is the lack of support for Qi2 charging. This is the new version of the Qi wireless charging standard, which borrows a lot of features from Apple's MagSafe charging system. It embeds magnets into the phone, allowing users to magnetically attach the phone to a Qi2 charger for more efficient and faster wireless charging, plus the convenience of magnetic accessories to enhance the phone. I expected to see several Qi2 Android phones in 2024, but all we got was HMD's Skyline. Now, in a move that'll make things more confusing, the Galaxy S25 series is being classified as “Qi2 ready.”\nThis is a new classification for phones that won't have the built-in magnets but will feature official and third-party Qi2 cases with magnets inside, essentially bringing a similar if not the same magnetic experience as a proper Qi2 device. Android users who want MagSafe's utility have had to rely on these cases so far, so it's just a shame that Qi2 is still not natively part of these brand new phones.\nCamera specs are roughly the same as before, with the ultrawide being the exception on the Galaxy S25 Ultra—it now packs 50 megapixels instead of 12. Samsung says this in turn boosts the quality of macro photos. There are some more interesting changes to the image processing algorithm. Samsung's next-gen ProVisual Engine uses a “spatial-temporal filter” to distinguish between moving and stationary objects to ensure photo subjects don't blur when capturing a picture in low-light conditions. Double-analysis noise removal analyzes every pixel for noise, looks at eight pixels around it, and removes the noise to clean up the image.\nSamsung has routinely tried to match Apple with camera features, but it has typically skimped on all the “pro” video capabilities Apple offers, like ProRes or Log video recording. Well, now that's changing. The Galaxy S25 series supports “Galaxy Log” recording. This is a niche feature for a subset of creators, but it offers greater control over the colors and dynamic range of video clips. Videos are also now captured at 10-bit HDR.\nThere's not much else in the way of hardware innovation. You won't find any fancy silicon-carbon batteries that are available on phones like the OnePlus 13, nor charging speed improvements. In fact, something's missing this year on the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen: Bluetooth. The stylus is still baked into the phone but it no longer features Bluetooth, eliminating some remote control features Samsung says barely anyone used.\nThe AI Party\nThe Galaxy S25 is a tale of two AIs: Gemini and Bixby. Yes, while Google's Gemini AI assistant sits at the forefront—it can finally be triggered through a long press of the power button—Samsung is bringing its original Bixby voice assistant out from the shadows.\nBixby has been enhanced with large language models but is still designed to handle phone functions, like changing device settings. Gemini is meant to be used for general web queries and more complex actions. You can even have two hot words, one for each assistant. I foresee all of this being confusing; in a quick demo, I asked Gemini to change the device font settings, and it said it couldn't do it. I asked Bixby, and it did the job. I have no idea why Gemini couldn't hand off this task to Bixby.\nThe highlight AI feature debuting on the Galaxy S25 series is “cross-app experiences.” These are tasks you can ask Gemini to perform, even if the task requires multiple apps. For example, you can ask for the schedule of this season's Arsenal matches and then add it to your calendar; Gemini will then search and add every Arsenal FC game in the season to your schedule. Or you can ask it to find pet-friendly vegan restaurants nearby and text the list to a friend. It even works with images too—snap a pic of your fridge and ask Gemini to find you a recipe based on the available ingredients. These cross-app experiences work with Google apps, Samsung's Galaxy apps, and select third-party apps, like WhatsApp and Spotify.\nIf these sound familiar, it's because phone makers have been promising variations of these commands for close to a decade. Now, they'll hopefully work better, especially since Gemini is adept at natural language and queries don't need to be so rigid. Speaking of, you can now search conversationally in Samsung's Gallery app to find old photos, much like what Google rolled out to Google Photos last year. Circle to Search can listen for audio sources to determine the name of a song—yet another long-available feature getting spruced up for the AI age.\nAll these AI features have culminated in a new app: Now Brief. Samsung calls this proactive assistance (remember Google's Now on Tap?) where a morning brief arrives with the weather, upcoming calendar events, stock details, news articles, and suggestions to trigger routines. There's also an evening brief with a summary of the day's events with photos. Since the feature can plug into email, it'll send reminders about expiring coupons and upcoming travel tickets. Samsung claims it can even suggest changing an 8:45 am alarm even earlier if it sees a 9 am meeting on the schedule.\nOn the lock screen, a “Now Bar” widget persists at the bottom, much like Apple's Live Activities. It'll offer quick access to the Now Brief app, but it will also show updates for favorite sports teams, along with glanceable directions from Google Maps.\nThe rest of the AI features are playing a bit of catch-up to Apple and Google's Pixel phones. There's Drawing Assist, a generative AI tool to craft new images in different art styles based on sketches or text prompts. AI Select works with the S Pen stylus on the S25 Ultra and understands what is selected—for example, if a video is selected, it will suggest turning it into a GIF. Audio Eraser is an editing tool to cut out background noise in videos post-capture, canceling out the sound of a crowd's chatter or an ambulance's siren. Finally, Samsung's Generative Edit feature, which lets you erase unwanted objects in images, now works locally on the device and is much more accurate and faster.\nSome good news on the sustainability front: Every Galaxy S25 device uses a minimum of 50 percent recycled cobalt in the battery, sourced from older Galaxy devices or discarded batteries during the manufacturing process. Samsung also says every external component of the S25+ and S25 uses at least one recycled material.\nLastly, there's one bit of news Samsung announced but won't be available at launch for these phones, and it pertains to Samsung Wallet. The company's tap-to-pay app will soon support a buy now, pay later system, allowing customers to create instant installment plans even when shopping offline. Also, it will support peer-to-peer payments regardless of digital wallet—meaning you might be able to send cash to a friend even if they're not on Samsung Wallet.\nI'll have a review of the phones soon to vet all the new features. Preorders are open now, and it officially hits stores on February 7. Samsung has a new Galaxy Club early upgrade program that's somewhat similar to Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program. After purchasing the phone, either via a trade-in or installment plan, you can pay $8.33 per month for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, for example, and upgrade to the next Galaxy device after 12 months. Samsung will pay the remaining installments or 50 percent of the retail price with a trade-in to the next upgrade.",

    "content_text": "The Mexican government has announced the Mexico Embraces You program, which includes economic and social services for Mexicans deported from the United States. This measure is in response to the strict immigration policy that President Donald Trump announced on January 20, and which has already begun to materialize with the closure of the CBP One app.\nCBP One was launched in 2020, allowing foreign vendors to schedule cargo inspections. In 2023 the Biden administration expanded its functions to include unauthorized migrants seeking asylum. This Monday, on Inauguration Day, an order from Donald Trump put an end to the program, and thousands of scheduled appointments were canceled.\nRosa Icela Rodríguez, head of the Ministry of the Interior (SEGOB), unveiled the project during the morning conference of Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum. Rodríguez explained that the strategy includes economic support of 2,000 pesos (about $100) for Mexican citizens who lack the resources to return to their communities of origin. This support will be delivered through the new Bienestar Paisano Card.\nFederal authorities add that the plan is designed to allow Mexican migrants to join existing social programs, which include pensions for senior citizens and people with disabilities, scholarships for elementary and high school students, and the initiatives Sembrando Vida, Mujeres con Bienestar, Jóvenes Construyendo el Futuro, and Salud Casa por Casa.\nRepatriated Mexicans will be affiliated with the Mexican Social Security Institute. The program will grant them access to insurance for sickness and maternity, work risks, disability and life, retirement, and for severance in advanced age and old age. They will also be able to enjoy all social benefits and childcare services provided by the Social Security Law.

About 63 percent of US teens and a third of US adults use TikTok, according to Pew Research Center.\nAmong the places some of them took refuge was Likee, a TikTok clone launched by the profitable Singaporean tech company Joyy in 2017. Likee had about 33.9 million monthly users as of November, most of whom were outside the US. But on Saturday, Likee drew 143 percent more downloads and 37 percent more usage in the US than the previous day, according to Sensor Tower, which estimates figures by gathering data from a sample of devices. The trend continued into Sunday, when Likee usage ticked up 11 percent from a day earlier.\nEstimates from Apptopia, another company that studies the app industry, show that for months, Likee recorded less than 10,000 downloads per day in the US before jumping to nearly 167,000 on Sunday and about 286,000 on Monday. Apptopia also estimated similar bumps for TikTok competitors Clapper and Flip.\nOn Tuesday, shares of Likee’s parent company, Joyy, closed up about 3 percent, outpacing the average gain among its Nasdaq peers. Joyy does not break out Likee’s financials, but it and some of its other sibling apps collectively generated about $73 million in sales during last year’s third quarter from advertising and user purchases. Likee did not respond to a request for comment.\nOther less-frequented apps, including Clapper and Snap’s Snapchat, drew increased interest over the weekend to the tune of double-digit gains in user activity. TikTok’s biggest rivals, Meta's Instagram and Facebook, saw more modest single-digit boosts. YouTube and X, meanwhile, experienced little change in usage.\nRedNote, another Chinese app that Americans had flocked to in protest during the days before the ban, added 80 percent more users Sunday than the day before, according to Sensor Tower. In the first two days of the rush earlier in the week, over 700,000 new users joined RedNote, Reuters reported. Known as Xiaohongshu in Chinese, it ranked in recent days as the most-downloaded free app on the Google and Apple app stores in the US.\nTikTok came back online in the US on Sunday after president-elect Donald Trump promised to provide a temporary reprieve of the new law when he took power the following day. The statute, signed by former President Biden last year, effectively bans TikTok by threatening to fine web hosting providers and app stores that work with its parent company, Chinese tech giant ByteDance, unless it divests its ownership in TikTok. Users came back to TikTok in droves on Sunday, with daily active users up 17 percent over Saturday, the Sensor Tower data show.\nOn Monday, Trump issued an executive order providing for 75 additional days to sort out the dilemma over TikTok. But the legality of his decree remains in question, and TikTok is still unavailable in US app stores.

    "content_text": "When online search engines first appeared, they seemed miraculous. Now, though? It is a truth near-universally acknowledged that search is in the dumps, corroded by spam and ads.\nBig players like Google are insistent that AI is the savior of search, despite many early attempts to integrate AI ending in disaster. There’s a wave of services offering AI-powered answers, including Perplexity and OpenAI’s SearchGPT. Recently, I got an email promoting another new AI search engine—but this one has a notably quirky approach to answering questions. Called Pearl, it’s coming out of beta this week. Like other AI-powered search engines, Pearl initially answers questions by using large language models to provide answers. Then it does something unusual: It offers a human fact-check and the option to connect with experts and chat online or on the phone about the answer.\nReading about its gimmick, I didn’t really understand why it bothered with the AI answers at all. Why not just go straight to the human? I called its CEO, Andy Kurtzig, to find out.\nKurtzig stressed that Pearl is an extension of another search project he’s been working on for decades: a more traditional offering called JustAnswer, which charges a subscription and connects people to subject-matter experts based on their questions. “We started playing with the concept of AI combined with professional services about 11 years ago,” he says. When the generative AI boom took off, he decided to make Pearl a stand-alone product. (The company has had an older chatbot product named Pearl for many years and at one point rebranded JustAnswer as Pearl and then changed it back.)\nPearl’s LLM is built on top of a number of popular foundational models, including ChatGPT, and is customized to include JustAnswer’s trove of data, which includes an extensive history of questions posed and answered since it launched in 2003.\nIn Kurtzig’s view, Pearl lowers the barrier to entry for answers from experts. While JustAnswer costs money, Pearl has a freemium model. Its AI answers are free, as is its first layer of human fact-check, the TrustScore™, a ranking on a scale from 1 to 5 about the quality of an AI answer. When Pearl users want to go a step further and have an expert expand upon an AI answer, they are prompted to sign up for its $28-a-month service fee.\nOne line in particular had jumped out at me in the initial email I received about Pearl. It had claimed that Pearl would “solve many of the mounting legal challenges AI search engines face.” But … how? Kurtzig noted that most AI search engines could be legally liable under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act for the answers they give, since they are acting more as a publisher than a platform. As Pearl incorporates human experts into its answer process, Kurtzig believes that Pearl will have the Section 230 protections that shield traditional search engines.\nOn top of that, he claims that Pearl is significantly less likely to provide misinformation than many other AI search engines—which he believes are likely to deal with “a tidal wave” of lawsuits based on bad answers they give. “Those other players are building amazing technologies. I call them Ferraris or Lamborghinis,” Kurtzig says. “We’re building a Volvo—safety first.”\nThis pitch about Pearl’s superiority, of course, made me even more keen to try it. Kurtzig seemed so certain that Pearl would still enjoy Section 230 protections. I asked the AI if it agreed.\nPearl said it likely qualifies as an “interactive computer service” under Section 230, which would mean that it’d be shielded from being treated as a publisher, just as Kurtzig suspected. But, the AI went on, “Pearl’s situation is unique because it generates content using AI.” It didn’t have a definitive answer for me after all.\nWhen I asked to speak to a lawyer directly, it rerouted me to JustAnswer, where it asked me to provide the answer I wanted verified. I said I needed to go back and copy the answer, as it was several paragraphs long, but when I navigated back to the Pearl website, the conversation was gone and it had reset to a fresh chat.\nWhen I tried again, this time opening the Pearl browser on desktop, I received a similarly uncertain answer. I decided to trigger a human-fact check; after several minutes, I received the TrustScore™—a measly 3!\nPearl recommended that I seek out an actual expert opinion, porting me to its subscription page. I’d been given a log-in so I didn’t have to pay while I tested the tool. It then connected me with one of its “legal eagle” experts.\nUnfortunately, the lawyer’s answers were not clearer than the AI. He noted that there was ongoing legal debate about how Section 230 will apply to AI search engines and other AI tools, but when I asked him to provide specific arguments, he gave a strange answer noting that “most use shell companies or associations to file.”\nWhen I asked for an example of one such shell company—quite confused about what that has to do with a public debate about Section 230—the “legal eagle” asked if I wanted him to put together a package. Even more confused, I said yes. I got a pop-up window indicating that my expert wanted to charge me an additional $165 to dig up the information.\nI declined, frustrated.\nI then asked Pearl about the history of WIRED. The AI response was serviceable, although basically the same stuff you’ll find on Wikipedia. When I asked for its TrustScore™ I was once again confronted with a 3, suggesting it was not a very good answer. I selected the option to connect with another human expert. This time around, possibly because it was a question about the media and not a straightforward legal or medical topic, it took a while for the expert to appear—well over 20 minutes. When he did, the expert (it was never established what gave him his media bona fides, although his profile indicated he’d been working with JustAnswer since 2010) gave me a remarkably similar answer to the AI. Since I was doing a free test, it didn’t matter, but I would’ve been annoyed if I had actually paid the subscription fee just to get the same mediocre answer from both a human and an AI.\nFor my last stab at using the service, I went for a straightforward question: how to refinish kitchen floors. This time, things went much more smoothly. The AI returned an adequate answer, akin to a transcript of a very basic YouTube tutorial. When I asked the human expert to assign a TrustScore™, they gave it a 5. It seemed accurate enough, for sure. But—as someone who really does want to DIY refinish my kitchen’s old pine planks—I think when I actually go looking for guidance, I’ll rely on other online communities of human voices, ones that don’t charge $28 a month: YouTube and Reddit.\nIf you end up testing Pearl, or any other newfangled AI search products, and you have a memorable experience, please do let me know how it went in the comments below the article. You can also reach me by email at kate_knibbs@wired.com. Thanks for reading, and stay warm!",

    "content_text": "California-based Vast Space has big ambitions. The company is aiming to launch a commercial space station, the Haven-2, into low Earth orbit by 2028, which would allow astronauts to stay in space after the decommissioning of the International Space Station (ISS) in 2030. In doing so, it is attempting to muscle in on NASA’s plans to develop commercial low-orbit space stations with partner organizations—but most ambitious of all are Vast Space’s goals for what it will eventually put into space: a station that has its own artificial gravity.\n“We know that in weightlessness we can live a year or so, and in conditions that are not easy. Perhaps, however, lunar or Martian gravity is enough to live comfortably for a lifetime. The only way to find out is to build stations with artificial gravity, which is our long-term goal,” says Max Haot, Vast’s CEO.\nVast Space was founded in 2021 by 49-year-old programmer and businessman Jed McCaleb, the creator of the peer-to-peer networks eDonkey and Overnet, as well as the early and now defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox. Vast Space announced in mid-December a partnership with SpaceX to launch two missions to the ISS, which will be milestones in the company’s plan to launch its first space station, Haven-1, later in 2025. The missions, still without official launch dates, will fall within NASA’s private astronaut missions program, through which the space agency wants to promote the development of a space economy in low Earth orbit.\nFor Vast, this is part of a long-term business strategy. “Building an outpost that artificially mimics gravity will take 10 to 20 years, as well as an amount of money that we don’t have now,” Haot admits. “However, to win the most important contract in the space station market, which is the replacement of ISS, with our founder’s resources, we will launch four people on a [SpaceX] Dragon in 2025. They will stay aboard Haven-1 for two weeks, then return safely, demonstrating to NASA our capability before any competitor.”\nSpace for One More?\nWhat Vast Space is trying to do, by showing its capabilities, is get involved in NASA’s Commercial Destinations in Low Earth Orbit (CLD) program, a project the space agency inaugurated in 2021 with a $415 million grant to support the development of private low-Earth orbit stations.\nThe money was initially allocated to three different projects: one from aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman, which has since exited the progam; a joint venture called Starlab; and Orbital Reef, from Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin. Vast has no contract with the US space agency, but it aims to outstrip its competitors by showing NASA that it can put a space station into space ahead of these others. The agency will choose which project’s station to back in the second half of 2026.\nBy doing this, Vast is borrowing from SpaceX’s playbook. Not only has Vast Space drawn some of its employees and the design of equipment and vehicles from Elon Musk’s company, it’s also trying to replicate its approach to market: to be ready before anyone else, by having technologies and processes already qualified and validated in orbit. “We are lagging behind,” Haot says. “What can we do to win? Our answer, in the second half of 2025, will be the launch of Haven-1.”\nHaven-1 will have a habitable volume of 45 cubic meters, a docking port, a corridor with consumable resources for the crew’s personal living quarters, a laboratory, and a deployable communal table set up next to a domed window about a meter high. On board, roughly 425 kilometers above Earth’s surface, the station will use Starlink laser links to communicate with satellites in low Earth orbit, tech that was first tested during the Polaris Dawn mission in the autumn of 2024.\n“Although not intended for tourists or designed as a hotel, Haven-1 will boast a comfortable and unique design compared to its predecessor stations,” Haot says. “It will house professional astronauts or self-funded individuals who will perform important tasks, as the lab will be a demonstrator for Haven-2, with which we aim to replace ISS.”\nVast’s strategy also somewhat evokes that of the other ongoing commercial station project: that of Texas-based Axiom Space, which predates NASA’s CLD program. Axiom has a contract with NASA for producing modules for the ISS, and has plans to create its own commercial space station using these. The Axiom station should, in theory, be at an advanced stage, but in practice its assembly sequence was revised a few weeks ago, and the company is facing financial problems.\nA New Haven\nOnce the Haven-1 mission has launched, Haot is confident that Haven-2, the larger, modular second station, will soon follow. “The first module will be ready by 2028, so that NASA can have two years to test it while ISS is still operational. Three more identical modules will go into orbit between 2029 and 2030,” he says.\n“The first difference from Haven-1 will be certification from NASA, which will then become our main customer. Plus, Haven-2 will have two docking ports and be 5 meters longer, with twice the pressurized volume. This will allow us to have more life support resources and more space.”\nThe station’s core module, aboard a SpaceX Starship, will then be launched in 2030, with the already launched modules attaching to it. “It will have a 7-meter diameter, an airlock for extravehicular activities, a docking port, and a robotic arm. The original four modules will be reconfigured according to its characteristics, to add four more in 2031 and 2032.” In total, the station will then have a habitable volume of 550 cubic meters, capable of accommodating up to 12 people. (ISS has a habitable volume of 388 cubic meters.)\nBy then, tests to artificially reproduce gravity will have already begun, but not on Haven-2, which, having to serve as a laboratory, will have to meet weightlessness criteria imposed by NASA: “The tests will be carried out on Haven-1, which we plan to leave in orbit for three years, until 2028,” says Haot. “Before we run out of operations, we will rotate it to replicate lunar gravity on the payload portion, but without a crew. This will bring us closer to our corporate goal of continuing to promote artificial gravity.”\nImpossible not to notice, however, is how Vast Space’s ambitions are focused on a commercial market that is nonexistent to date. Even to this challenge, Haot has an answer: “So far, all space stations have been built by governments and at exorbitant prices: Our project will allow a cost reduction of about five times or maybe more. We are sure it is a profitable horizon, but we are not naive; certain conditions will need to be met.” Key, Haot says, will be securing NASA as an anchor customer, and building from there. “If we guarantee the interests of all the nations in the ISS program, but also attract countries hitherto excluded from the market—if in short we know how to create an efficient and low-cost company—our dreams will be within reach.”\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.",

    "content_text": "Almost four years to the day since his father was taken into custody for his part in the January 6 Capitol riot, Jackson Reffitt watched in complete shock as President Donald Trump signed an executive order that pardoned and commuted sentences for his father and some 1,500 other insurrectionists.\nReffitt has spent most of the last four years in hiding, constantly on the move every few months. He was the person who tipped off the FBI about his father’s involvement in the insurrection. Jackson’s father, Guy Reffitt, was a member of the Texas Three Percenter group when he stormed the Capitol wearing body armor and carrying a pistol and zip ties. He was caught on camera urging other rioters to storm the Capitol building and told members of his militia group that he intended to drag House Speaker Nancy Pelosi out of the building by her ankles, “with her head hitting every step on the way down.”\n“Trump himself has given him a presidential pardon to let him be free. That validation is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience that he's never going to get again,” Reffitt tells WIRED. “I can't imagine what he's going to be willing to do now. It could get a whole hell of a lot worse.”\nReffitt is “terrified” about what is going to happen next and has armed himself with a handgun and a rifle to protect himself and his boyfriend. Over the past few years, he has been targeted, harassed, and threatened online.\nSince Trump pardoned everyone, the threats are becoming even more intense.\nIn the last 24 hours “it's gotten worse than ever,” Reffitt tells WIRED. “I think just because, yet again, the validation that Trump is bringing is just making people a whole lot more emboldened to just say some vile, disgusting shit.”\nReffitt is not the only family member of a released January 6 prisoner who is concerned about the fallout from Trump’s blanket pardons. Tasha Adams, the ex-wife of Oath Keeper leader Stewart Rhodes, who had his 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy commuted by Trump, is also worried about what might happen. “Stewart is out of prison now and, frankly, I could really use a bit of a run fund, in case it comes to that,” Adams wrote on her GoFundMe page on Tuesday, hours after her ex-husband was released from prison.\nThe investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol became the biggest in Justice Department history and left many far-right militia groups in the country in ruins. But with a single pen stroke on Monday night, Trump has reinvigorated the militia movement, freeing their most prominent figures, including Rhodes and Proud Boy leader Enrique Tarrio.\n“One of things I’m most concerned about is the risk of groups that were decimated after J6 coming back stronger, especially since many of them had their sentences commuted or were outright pardoned,” says Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. “I wouldn’t be shocked if the Oath Keepers began making more appearances, and seeing the Proud Boys accelerate their culture war tactics, especially against the LGBTQ community, like we’ve seen before. Their leaders are free, they have a lot to catch up on, and they are likely feeling vindicated.”\nAre you a family member of a January 6 prisoner who is being released? We’d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact David Gilbert at david.gilbert@wired.com or securely on Signal on DavidGilbert.01\nGuy Reffitt was the first rioter to go on trial for his actions on January 6 and initially received a sentence of seven years and three months, which was reduced by seven months in December after a Supreme Court ruling that led to the dismissal of an obstruction charge against him.\n“I’m a very strong Patriot, with fabulous support from Patriot Warriors, as we navigate troubled waters,” Reffitt wrote to one acquaintance from jail in a text message submitted by the prosecution at his December resentencing.\nIn October, he sent another text message to the same acquaintance, writing: “I do love the J6 family dynamics. We really are a ‘Yuge’ family now. We all have a common goal. Save America and the people.”\nJackson Reffitt believes that his father has become even more extreme in prison. “He's gotten worse throughout the years,” says Reffitt. “He's gotten more radicalized, and now he gets out, and now he can buy a gun, and now he can do whatever he wants. That is just so terrifying to me.”\nAfter Trump signed the executive order, Jackson Reffitt switched on his laptop and began watching the celebrations at Freedom Corner, a site next to the DC Jail where activists have gathered every night for more than 900 days to call for the release of January 6 prisoners.\nOn camera, one of the leaders of Freedom Corner was shouting out the names of people who were going to be released, including many prisoners who had been convicted of violently assaulting police officers. The crowd responded to each name with loud cheers.\nAs Reffitt watched in terror, he saw people in the crowd that he recognized: his mother Nicole Reffitt and sisters Peyton and Sarah.\nNicole Reffitt has become one of the most prominent organizers of the January 6 vigils at Freedom Corner in recent years, moving from their family home in Texas to Washington, DC, full time.\nWhen WIRED spoke to Reffitt in the days after Trump’s election victory in November, she sought to strike a conciliatory tone, claiming that she was not calling for the release of all prisoners. “I don’t believe a blanket pardon is appropriate. A blanket pardon would give everyone a pass. There should be accountability. If you broke the law you should be held accountable.”\nHer son doesn’t believe her. “She never cared; she was trying to pander to a more inclusive audience. She wanted them free,” says Jackson Reffit, adding that his relationship with his mother is irreparably broken. His boyfriend is transitioning, and Jackson has not forgotten the slurs his mother has used about the LGBTQ community in online streams and publications.\nNicole Reffitt did not respond to messages and calls from WIRED.\nJackson Reffitt says he is safe for now and that he will eventually speak to his father, but not for some time. “Once I feel situated, and once I figure out what's going on with him and everything, then I can work on [contacting him],” Reffitt said. “But right now I can’t. I'm just too paranoid.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nSo you need to send some money. Maybe you want to slip a couple of $20 bills in a birthday card. Maybe it’s a larger payment for some not-at-all-sketchy, off-the-books services rendered. Either way, it can be a pain to send paper money without having to worry that it might mysteriously slip out of your envelope into someone else’s pocket.\n“Sending cash physically via mail or something is probably one of the least efficient options for moving money around,” says Kevin L. Matthews, a financial adviser who has offered money advice for WIRED before. “It's not necessarily something that I would recommend.”\nThe problem, he says, is that if something goes wrong and the cash goes missing, there’s really nothing you can do about it. There are better ways to transfer finances, but if you absolutely have to get your coins from one piggy bank to another, here are the best ways to do so without getting ripped off.\nDon’t Get Scammed\nTo be clear up front, you should not just stick a wad of cash in the mail and hope for the best. There's too high of a chance it will get lost, stolen, or otherwise wind up in the hands of someone you don’t intend.\nAnd to that last point, if you are sending somebody any kind of payment, ask yourself these basic questions: Do you personally know the individual you’re sending money too? Have you vetted the agency purporting to get your dough to the right place? Is there any fine print? Does the method for sending money seem too good to be true? If any of those questions give you pause, it's probably a scam.\nScams are evolving quickly, Matthews says, and they are getting more difficult to detect all the time. “The number one rule is, don't ever send any money to anyone that you do not know. And don't be afraid to call and check. That's always an option. Be careful of the details, verify the information, and just make sure this makes sense. Because usually once that money walks out the door, it's absolutely not coming back.”\nThere are lots of ways to keep yourself and your loved ones from getting ripped off and protect yourself from AI scam calls. (Grandma, I promise you, Charter.bot texting to ask you to send it gift cards is not a legitimate way to pay your cable bill.)\nPaper Trail\nThere are ways to send cash safely. If you’re just sending a small amount, like slapping a fiver in a birthday card, using the regular mail system is probably fine. You run the risk of it getting lost, like with anything you mail. But if you care about the money getting where it needs to go, you should insure it or send a money order.\nIn the US, you’re allowed to ship cash up to $500 without having to register it with the US Postal Service. It’s not technically illegal to send more than that through the US Mail, but it’s also not a good idea. If you do need to send cash and don’t mind Uncle Sam knowing about it, you can insure your package for a value of up to $50,000. There are a couple caveats, though.\nFirst, there is an additional charge for protected postage, ranging from $10 to $42, depending on the declared value inside. (For cash, the declared value is however much money you’re sending.) And you’ll have to go into an actual post office to declare how much money you are sending, then fill out a form for Registered mail. After sending the envelope or package, you can use the USPS tracking service to see when your money is delivered. The process is a bit of a pain but certainly better than sending a box of cash that “mysteriously” disappears.\nCheck It Out\nChecks are the vinyl albums of payment methods—a seemingly outdated medium, inconvenient to get set up, but overall really worthwhile once you get into it.\n“If I had to do something like this and send money physically, I would go old-school,” Matthews says. “I would send a check.”\nChecks are a way to get money to someone quickly and efficiently through the mail while also having the built-in protection that only the person whose name you make the check out to should be able to cash it. If something goes wrong, you can call your bank and cancel the check. Plus, most banks now offer the ability to remote-deposit checks by taking pictures of them, so your recipient shouldn’t need to go into a bank if they want to deposit.\nMoney Order\nAlternatively, you can send a money order through the US Postal Service or a service like Western Union. In the UK, Royal Mail has a Special Delivery service for sending money. Fees vary widely, though the USPS is probably your best bet in the US if you can get to a post office (fees there range from $1 to $3). You can send up to US$1,000 anywhere in the US via the post office. On the other end, your recipient will get the money order in the mail, then cash the money order at their local post office. That means they will also need to go to the physical location.\nWalmart offers money order services as well, via a partnership with Western Union. The difference is that Walmart says it charges a maximum fee of $1 for its services. You’ll also have to go into a physical Walmart location and share the details of the sender (that’s you) and the recipient.\nMoney orders are safe and reliable if you get them through the right vendor. The only downside is that your recipient will have to go to the same establishment that you did to cash the check, like a post office or Walmart.\nDigital Dollars\nYou probably already know how to send money on your phone. Apps like Venmo and CashApp are ubiquitous, as they are fast and easy ways to request and transfer money between your accounts. (If you link a credit card, you may be charged a fee.) If you and your recipient both have Apple devices, you probably already have a person-to-person money-transfer option built into your phone. Apple Cash lets you send money directly to your contacts and even transfer it by tapping the devices together. (There used to be a similar way to do this natively on Android phones with the Google Pay app, but Google merged that into its Wallet app and ditched the peer-to-peer payment services.)\nIf you want to make it feel a little less transactional than the last time you paid your friend for chicken wings, you can make a payment app transaction a little snazzier with Gift card mode. Just make a payment in either Venmo or CashApp and there will be a small gift option in the window. Tap that, and you’ll be able to choose to send a digital gift card for a specific retailer, or just send cash. You can choose a fun little animation that your recipient will see, so it will alert them and not just appear like a routine transaction. See? Look how thoughtful you are!\nIf you don't need to worry about gifting, Zelle is a great option. If it's offered by the banks of both parties, then it's tied directly to your bank accounts. The money is transferred between accounts within minutes and ready to spend right away. There are a couple of limitations: Zelle only works between US banks, and there are daily limits for transfers that can be as low as $500.\nMatthews cautions that even though these methods seem like the most direct and straightforward, they have also been prone to attracting scammers who try to capitalize on the public social feeds that are displayed in services like Venmo.\nInternational Waters\nIf you’re looking to send money internationally, your safest bet is a wire transfer. There are also online services like Wise.com that calculate the exchange rate and send funds while charging roughly a 0.88 percent fee. (So if you send $1,000, Wise takes an $8.75 fee.)\nGift Cards\nIf all this feels too risky or not worth the bother, there are always that old holiday stalwart: gift cards.\nGift cards can feel like a slightly more personal touch than just tossing a wad of bills at your giftee. After all, you know this kid likes his PlayStation, so your Best Buy gift card means you’ve been paying at least a little attention, right?\nYou can also buy gift cards that aren’t tied to a specific retailer and can be spent freely anywhere that accepts regular debit card payments. Banks sell them as preloaded debit cards backed by the major credit card companies: American Express, MasterCard, and Visa. They charge a fee, usually between $3 and $8, depending on the total amount loaded onto the card. You or your recipient can also create an online login at the issuer’s website, which will let them keep track of the balance remaining on the card. There are sketchy gift card sellers out there, though, so you should do your best to make sure the card is legit and reputable by getting a referral from the issuer: Visa, MasterCard, and American Express all sell gift cards through third-party partners.\nBe Careful With Crypto\nCryptocurrency is all the rage, except for when it very much is not. If you’re using a stablecoin—a digital currency that is directly tied to the value of a fiat currency like the US dollar, you’re probably fine. But more volatile coins that fluctuate wildly may not be the best for making casual payments.\n“You are absolutely taking risk depending on what coin you use,” Matthews says. “You send something like Bitcoin or Doge or whatever else is out there, then the value of that may or may not be what you expect it to be between the time you send it and time the person gets it or the time you wake up the next morning. So it can absolutely be a risk. You could be giving somebody a fortune, or nothing at all.”",

Maybe you want to slip a couple of $20 bills in a birthday card. Maybe it’s a larger payment for some not-at-all-sketchy, off-the-books services rendered. Either way, it can be a pain to send paper money without having to worry that it might mysteriously slip out of your envelope into someone else’s pocket.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“Sending cash physically via mail or something is probably one of the least efficient options for moving money around,” says Kevin L. Matthews, a financial adviser who has offered money advice for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/video/watch/tech-support-financial-advisor-answers-money-questions-from-twitter\">WIRED before</a>. “It's not necessarily something that I would recommend.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">The problem, he says, is that if something goes wrong and the cash goes missing, there’s really nothing you can do about it. There are better ways to transfer finances, but if you absolutely have to get your coins from one piggy bank to another, here are the best ways to do so without getting ripped off.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Don’t Get Scammed</h2><p class=\"paywall\">To be clear up front, you should not just stick a wad of cash in the mail and hope for the best. There's too high of a chance it will get lost, stolen, or otherwise wind up in the hands of someone you don’t intend.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">And to that last point, if you are sending somebody any kind of payment, ask yourself these basic questions: Do you personally know the individual you’re sending money too? Have you vetted the agency purporting to get your dough to the right place? Is there any fine print? Does the method for sending money seem too good to be true? If any of those questions give you pause, it's probably a scam.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Scams are evolving quickly, Matthews says, and they are getting more difficult to detect all the time. “The number one rule is, don't ever send any money to anyone that you do not know. And don't be afraid to call and check. That's always an option. Be careful of the details, verify the information, and just make sure this makes sense. Because usually once that money walks out the door, it's absolutely not coming back.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">There are lots of ways to keep yourself and your loved ones from <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/older-relatives-getting-ripped-off/\">getting ripped off</a> and protect yourself <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-protect-yourself-ai-scam-calls-detect/\">from AI scam calls</a>. (Grandma, I promise you, <em>Charter.bot</em> texting to ask you to send it gift cards is not a legitimate way to pay your cable bill.)</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Paper Trail</h2><p class=\"paywall\">There are ways to send cash safely. If you’re just sending a small amount, like slapping a fiver in a birthday card, using the regular mail system is probably fine. You run the risk of it getting lost, like with anything you mail. But if you care about the money getting where it needs to go, you should insure it or send a money order.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In the US, you’re allowed to ship cash up to $500 without having to register it with the US Postal Service. It’s not technically illegal to send more than that through the US Mail, but it’s also not a good idea. If you do need to send cash and don’t mind Uncle Sam knowing about it, you can <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-are-the-Limits-for-Insuring-Cash-and-Checks\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-are-the-Limits-for-Insuring-Cash-and-Checks\" href=\"https://faq.usps.com/s/article/What-are-the-Limits-for-Insuring-Cash-and-Checks\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">insure your package</a> for a value of up to $50,000.

    "content_text": "A little over 11 years and three months ago, Ross Ulbricht was arrested in the science fiction section of a public library in San Francisco, caught with his laptop still logged in to the Silk Road, the world’s first dark-web drug market that he created and ran under the pseudonym the Dread Pirate Roberts.\nNow, after being sentenced to life in prison and spending more than a decade behind bars, Ulbricht will walk free, thanks to Donald Trump—and to the president’s ever-closer ties to the American cryptocurrency world.\n“I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbright to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,” president Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday evening, misspelling Ulbricht's last name. “The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!”\nFor close to two and a half years after Ulbricht created the Silk Road in 2011, the dark-web site facilitated the sale of vast amounts of narcotics, as well as counterfeit documents, money laundering services and, at times, guns, for hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin payments. After the FBI located the Silk Road’s server in Iceland in 2013 and arrested then 29-year-old Ulbricht in San Francisco, he was convicted on seven charges relating to the distribution of narcotics, money laundering, and computer hacking, as well as a “continuing criminal enterprise” statute—sometimes known as the “kingpin statute”—usually reserved for mob bosses and cartel leaders. In 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison, a punishment beyond even the 20-plus years that prosecutors in the case requested.\nSince then, a Free Ross movement has steadily pressed for Ulbricht’s release, first in a failed appeal, then in petitions for clemency. Many of Ulbricht’s supporters have long argued that the Silk Road was a principled libertarian experiment in free trade, one in which Ulbricht allowed only “victimless crime”—despite prosecutors arguing during his trial that at least six people died of opioid overdoses from drugs linked to the Silk Road. They point out that Ulbricht never actually sold or possessed drugs himself, and rather ran a website that facilitated their sale. And they argue that by moving the sale of narcotics online, he reduced violence in the drug trade and committed no violence himself.\nThat argument has been complicated, however, by allegations that Ulbricht tried to have six people killed who presented a threat to him or the Silk Road. Ultimately all six alleged murders-for-hire were fake—one was staged by undercover DEA agents and five more were a scam. Ulbricht was charged with only one of those alleged paid killings in a separate prosecution in Maryland, which was then dropped after he received a life sentence in his New York trial. But evidence presented at Ulbricht’s trial showed him allegedly arranging those killings and even pinpointed transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain that showed a payment for them from Ulbricht’s laptop to the would-be killer.\nThose allegations of murders-for-hire, in fact, dissuaded the first Trump administration from granting clemency to Ulbricht. The White House in 2020 considered freeing Ulbricht but ultimately rejected the idea because of the alleged role of violence in the case, according to one former government official involved in the process who spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity.\nSince then, however, the Trump administration has shifted its stance on Ulbricht’s case—in part, perhaps, due to its embrace of the libertarian cryptocurrency community, for whom Ulbricht has become a martyr and cause célèbre. At the Libertarian National Convention in Washington, DC, last May, then presidential candidate Trump promised to commute Ulbricht’s sentence “on day one” if reelected. (Ultimately, day one passed with no clemency for Ulbricht, even as Trump pardoned more than a thousand participants in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, though Trump ally Elon Musk promised in a post to X on Monday evening that “Ross will be freed too.”)\nJust what role Ulbricht will play in the free world is far from clear. Even in his statement to the judge at his sentencing hearing in 2015, Ulbricht never fully acknowledged the harm inflicted by the Silk Road’s drug sales. And according to Jared Der-Yeghiayan, a former Homeland Security Investigations agent who infiltrated the Silk Road during the investigation, Ulbricht still shows little remorse for his actions in his public posts to X.\n“The idea of him being released doesn’t bother me in the least,” says Der-Yeghiayan, who now works as the head of strategic intelligence at cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis. “I do get bothered if there’s now a perception that he did nothing wrong; that doesn’t acknowledge the facts of the case.”\nAmong some advocates of criminal justice reform, however, Ulbricht has become an exemplar of oversentencing, particularly given that he was technically charged with nonviolent crimes. “Ross has served more than enough time. He has been a model prisoner. He’s a first-time, nonviolent offender. He poses zero safety risk to the community,” Alice Johnson, CEO of the justice reform foundation Taking Action for Good, told WIRED in November. Johnson spent two decades in prison herself for attempted possession with intent to distribute before Trump commuted her life sentence in 2018 and pardoned her in 2020. “I believe that Ross’ case is going to pave the way for many others who have been unjustly given these draconian sentences to come home.”\nOn Tuesday night, Ulbricht's supporters celebrated his freedom and voiced their gratitude to Trump for his clemency. “Words cannot express how grateful we are,” reads a tweet from @Free_Ross, an X account devoted to the more than decade-long effort on Ulbricht's behalf. “President Trump is a man of his word and he just saved Ross's life. ROSS IS A FREE MAN!!!!!\"\nAdditional reporting by Joel Khalili",

    "content_text": "In the summer of 2020, 15 recognized leaders in US public health gathered to author an article in The Lancet—one of the world’s most eminent medical journals—decrying Donald Trump’s intention to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization, a decision that was later reversed by President Biden before it took effect.\nNearly five years later, one of the opening salvos of Trump’s second term has been to again initiate the process of withdrawing the US from the WHO. The move is already drawing both controversy and the threat of legal challenges.\nAccording to a 1948 joint resolution passed by both houses of Congress, any such withdrawal requires the US to provide the WHO with one year’s notice, but it appears that Trump’s intentions are to withdraw immediately and do so without seeking congressional approval.\n“The executive order announces the immediate withdrawal from WHO, and he’s not seeking congressional authorization, and he’s also not giving the required one year’s notice,” says Lawrence Gostin, a professor in public health law at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, DC, and one of the coauthors of the 2020 Lancet article. “In my view, this is reckless and it’s lawless, and it needs to be challenged in court.”\nTrump has a long history of criticizing the WHO, previously accusing the organization of being “corrupt,” ripping off America, and “severely mismanaging and covering up” the spread of Covid-19. The US has historically been one of the WHO’s largest funders, with some estimates suggesting that it provides a fifth of the organization’s entire budget. Between 2022 and 2023, the US provided the WHO with nearly $1.3 billion.\nHowever, Gostin and others are particularly concerned about the impacts of a US withdrawal on the country’s ability to manage the ongoing threat of infectious diseases. While the WHO has a far-reaching remit, ranging from advice on essential medicines to public policy recommendations on everything from tobacco and drug use to road safety, it is arguably most impactful when it comes to the surveillance of potentially problematic new diseases, such as bird flu, and coordinating an international response.\n“Withdrawing from WHO makes us more alone, more vulnerable, and more fragile in the world,” says Gostin. “You can’t shut down a border against a pathogen. We need WHO to be on the ground to put out fires before they get to the United States. And we also need WHO’s vast network to provide us with the information about mutations and viruses that we need to develop life-saving vaccines and medical treatments.”\nAccording to Sten Vermund, chief medical officer of the Global Virus Network and another coauthor of The Lancet article, what happens next depends on the reactions of other countries and nongovernment organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which all provide the WHO with significant funding. After Trump cut US contributions to the WHO to $680 million in 2020–21, Germany responded by quadrupling its contributions to more than $1 billion. The Danish government also agreed to double its contributions, placing a strong emphasis on improving sexual and reproductive health and tackling the rise of non-communicable diseases.\n“President Trump is trying to downsize the WHO, and the question is whether other high-income nations like those in Europe, Australia, Japan, and elsewhere, pick up some of the slack,” says Vermund. “Will the Gates Foundation, which has been a very generous donor, pick up some? It’s conceivable that others will tide things over until we have a new administration that might be more friendly to the WHO, but I’m dubious that they can pick up the entire chunk of the WHO budget which is paid for by the US.”\nAnd it isn’t just money that the US provides to the WHO, but staff and expertise too. “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has seconded a number of staff to the WHO, and I would predict that the Trump administration, with a new CDC director, will call those folks home,” says Vermund. “That would create quite a gap, because WHO funds do not pay for those individuals. So I think you’d have an almost immediate reduction of workforce and removal of critical professionals within the WHO organization.”\nAccording to Gostin, a lot of the money the US provides to the WHO is core mandatory funding, which all members are required to give, but some funds are particularly earmarked for causes in which the US has a vested interest, such as polio eradication, HIV/AIDS, and the process of identifying and controlling disease outbreaks before they spread and reach American shores. Without US funding, Gostin says that these programs wouldn’t completely disappear, but they would be significantly weakened.\n“Polio could come surging back,” says Gostin. “Remember we had polio in the wastewater in New York just a couple of years ago, and our kids are not being immunized. And we’ve had other real health scares in the United States, not just Covid-19, which killed more than a million people. We’ve had Zika, and the next health emergency might be just a mutation or two away. Maybe it’s already here in the form of avian influenza, and we’re going to need WHO to help us with that.”\nBoth Gostin and Vermund fear that withdrawing from the WHO will place the US at the back of the line when it comes to receiving critical information such as pathogen samples and genomic sequencing data, which pharmaceutical companies require to generate effective vaccines. Gostin cites how the US relies on WHO data every year to effectively update the seasonal influenza vaccine, while Vermund explains that financially speaking, it is far more efficient for the US to fund the WHO to help “snuff out” diseases at their source, rather than trying to tackle them when they arrive in the country.\n“We spent over $2 billion preparing for Ebola to hit US shores in 2014 and 2015, and since we only had five or six cases, that was very cost-ineffective,” says Vermund. “So that’s a typical example of how when the US goes it alone, it will be very inefficient compared with contributing to a multinational response to control a disease in the country of origin.”\nTrump’s decision does have one historical precedent, with Ronald Reagan’s administration being equally critical of the WHO throughout the 1980s. By the end of 1987, the WHO was facing the worst budget crisis in its history after the US delayed sending promised payments and recalled staff, despite the emergence of HIV/AIDS as a global killer. Public health experts at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health have since criticized this as contributing to the AIDS crisis.\nGostin believes that instead of paying less, the US should be putting pressure on other leading global powers such as China, Russia, Brazil, and India to pay more to the WHO to help support traditionally underfunded issues, such as the need to train more doctors and nurses in Africa, address the global rise of chronic diseases, and improve measures that can make us better prepared for the next pandemic.\nBecause of the potential impact of Trump’s decision, Gostin told WIRED that he is currently seeking cross-party political backing to potentially file a lawsuit to the Supreme Court, challenging Trump’s executive order. “Trump believes he can do it on his own,” he says. “But I think this is too consequential and momentous a decision for the president to make unilaterally on a whim, or as a grudge against WHO. It’s important enough that we need Congress to weigh in.”\nFor now, Vermund says that having made the WHO withdrawal a priority at the start of his presidency, it is highly likely that Trump will ultimately be able to get it over the line. While the US is supposed to fulfil its financial obligations to the agency for 2025, he also doubts that this will happen.\n“He’s initiating it very early in his presidency, on day one, and that gives him a lot of time to negotiate Congress and the courts if it should come to that,” says Vermund. “If he doesn’t pay his bills to an international agency, I’m not aware of any enforcement mechanism that is available. He may choose to ignore the agreements and go forward without formal legal authority.”",

    "content_text": "From the campaign trail, President Donald Trump was consistent: He would “end the electric vehicle mandate.” So it’s no surprise the phrase popped up in an executive order he signed on Monday, just hours after being sworn into office.\nHere’s the catch: The US has never had an EV mandate, or any sort of law or regulation requiring American buyers to go electric. Instead, the previous administration tried to create a series of carrots and sticks designed to make electric vehicles more appealing to both the manufacturers who make them and the people who buy them. An executive order issued yesterday attempts to undo all that.\nBut it’s complicated. Experts say the effects of the order aren’t clear and will likely take a while to iron out. The electric vehicle parts of the order seem more about messaging than immediate practical effects. “A lot of it is signaling the administration’s intent,” says Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and environment at the Duke Nicholas School of the Environment. “It’s unclear what the administration will be able to do immediately.”\nIn the meantime, automakers will continue to make and sell electric vehicles, and consumers will continue to be able to buy them. Some stricter emissions standards kick in in late 2026, and it usually takes manufacturers some five years to plan and build a car, which means autos following those forthcoming emissions regulations should be built and sold.\nUS and global automakers have already backed off some of their more ambitious EV-related promises, but electrics are still coming. The long-term future of the US auto industry is far from clear. Other governments are still pursuing EV-friendly policies, and critics warn they’ll look increasingly toward China’s auto industry to get them through the transition.\nOne thing that is clear for the future of EVs in the United States: There will be lawsuits.\nReports Incoming\nMonday’s executive order demands US agencies take a look at their rules related to EVs and determine whether they’re “unduly burdensome” and interfere with consumer choice. Those agencies are supposed to write up those findings into reports, which are due in 30 days.\nFrom there, the bureaucracy starts grinding, says Kathy Harris, who directs the clean vehicles program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If an agency wants to repeal a regulation, they need to go through the public process,” she says. That means publishing new proposed rules, taking public comments, going back and forth with the industry, and then publishing those comments. Lots of paperwork sits between the Trump administration and the final nixing of any EV-related programs.\nThe clearest way for the White House to loosen rules requiring automakers to make more EVs will be to target vehicle fuel efficiency and tailpipe standards. These require manufacturers to reach certain levels of gas efficiency across all the cars they make in the coming years and to cap the pollutants released. One of the easier ways automakers can hit those goals is to sell more electric vehicles, which don’t use gas or emit tailpipe pollutants at all. Last time Trump was in office, it took more than three years for his administration to replace Obama-era fuel efficiency standards. This time around, agencies might be more efficient and succeed in changing the rules more quickly, says Harris. Still, the process could take months and months.\nAnother area the Trump administration will likely target are subsidy programs, including the sort that give EV buyers federal tax credits that bring down the price of electrified cars by up to $7,500. The executive order does not explicitly mention this policy at all. This makes a sort of sense. The credits come from a law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and any changes to that law will need to make their way through Congress. The administration could try to stop handing out these credits through the Treasury Department, says Johnson, but that would likely trigger a lawsuit.\nThe order explicitly targets programs handing out funding for electric vehicle charging, more than $7 billion established by 2021’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and meant to ease the construction of new public chargers across the US. The order requires agencies to pause giving out those funds while they figure out whether they were appropriated with “consistency.” Much (but not all) of that funding has already been allocated to the states, many of which have signed contracts with infrastructure builders to get those chargers in the ground. It may be too late to put the brakes on all that charger money.\nJeff Davis, a budget and policy expert who is a senior fellow with the Eno Center for Transportation, says this section of the order is particularly “poorly drafted.” Its particular language means that it won’t prevent money from going out the door and projects getting built, but will make it hard for the states to get reimbursed after the work is done. This sort of thing “can be solved by suing the federal government and winning in court,” he says.\nAnother bit of wonkiness: The overly broad language of the order could mean that it not only puts a pause on climate-related programs but also all the projects funded by the infrastructure law. That includes billions in funding for highway construction projects, transit, airports, and even pipeline safety, Davis says.\nThe Golden State\nFor those interested in the future of EVs, attention now moves to California. Since the 1970s, the state has been allowed to create its own air regulations, including rules around vehicles. The executive order set out the Trump administration's intention to “terminate” the state’s abilities to control its own auto sales standards—exactly the power California is set to use to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars in the state by 2035.\nThe EPA will have to take the first step here to revoke that special privilege, granted to California through a “wavier.” That “inevitably be challenged in court,” says Julia Stein, the deputy director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA’s School of Law. The last Trump administration tried to nix California’s waiver; that didn’t work. Today, attempts will likely still “stand on shaky legal footing,” says Stein. “The upshot is that we’re in for another long waiver fight.”",

    "content_text": "It was an opportunity too good for Meta to ignore: On January 19, TikTok, one of its biggest social media rivals, was set to go dark across the United States when a new national security law went into effect. In the days and weeks before the ban, as millions of Americans were scrambling to find a suitable alternative to TikTok, Meta found ways to promote Instagram and Facebook as the answer. The tech giant made a flurry of design tweaks, rolled out new features, and ran advertisements that all positioned its platforms—and especially its video product, Reels—as direct competitors to TikTok.\nInstagram has scaled back its in-app shopping initiatives in recent years, but on Friday, Meta showed off a new feature that appears to be directly ripped from TikTok Shop, TikTok’s widely successful ecommerce platform. In a promotional video, two shopping creators working for Meta explained how influencers can now “more prominently display” products they are marketing in Reels. Instead of putting an Amazon or Walmart link in the comments, they can add a banner directing viewers to click on the item at the bottom of their videos—just like how it works on TikTok Shop.\nSome of Meta’s other efforts were just as pointed. Right before TikTok stopped working for roughly 14 hours on Saturday, some people reported that among the last things they saw on the platform were sponsored posts for Instagram. “Unsurprisingly, as TikTok goes down tonight, Meta is flooding my FYP with ads for Instagram,” one person said in a Bluesky post, referring to TikTok’s AI-powered For You Page feed. “In my last hour of TikTok I saw ads for instagram,” another person said on Threads.\nTikTok’s Ad Library, a transparency tool that allows anyone to search what paid campaigns are running on the platform, shows that Meta ran dozens of sponsored videos about Instagram and Reels in January that were collectively viewed by millions of users. But the tool includes data from only a select number of countries—mostly in Europe—and doesn’t cover what ads TikTok users may have seen in the United States. Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nOn Facebook, a number of people reported seeing a different promotion appear on their news feeds last week, encouraging them to link their TikTok accounts to their Facebook pages. “Build your social presence across apps by showing your TikTok profile link and follower count on your Facebook Page,” one version of the message read.\nGiven the timing, “this feels a bit passive aggressive,” one user wrote on X along with a screenshot of the banner. “Facebook is trolling users by suggesting we add our TikTok accounts to our Facebook pages,” joked another person.\nThe prompt appears to be connected to a feature Meta launched last month that allows users to display their YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram handles and follower counts on Facebook. However, the banner that people reported seeing in recent days mentioned only TikTok by name. The feature makes it easier for creators’ followers on other platforms to find and follow them on Facebook.\nTikTok announced it was coming back online in the US on January 19, after president-elect Donald Trump signaled he would sign an executive order following his inauguration the next day extending the deadline for the new law to take full effect. But Capcut, the beloved video-editing app run by TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, remained inaccessible for many people until Monday. Meta rushed to fill the gap, announcing it was launching a new editing app called Edits that appears to be a clone of CapCut. It will be available on Android next month.\nMeta also announced a slew of new Instagram Reels features last week that bring the app closer in line with TikTok, not all of which were welcomed by existing users. One is a new tab that lets people see what Reels their mutuals are liking and commenting on, as well as a “reply bar” to engage with that activity. Instagram users can also now upload Reels up to three minutes long, up from 90 seconds (TikTok allows clips up to 60 minutes).\nPerhaps the starkest change Instagram made, however, was to suddenly switch the shape of photos and videos on every user's profile from square to rectangular, mimicking how such content appears on TikTok. The move was met with swift backlash, and many Instagram creators complained that the aesthetic grids they had carefully cultivated over years on Instagram were now ruined.\nAdam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, acknowledged the negative feedback on Monday and said that the company would make it easier for users to customize their own feeds moving forward. “One of the mistakes I made was not giving people enough of a heads up,” he said in a post on Threads.\nIt’s not clear whether Meta’s strategy will be enough to convince loyal TikTok users to join its platforms or spend more time on them. During the hours that TikTok was inaccessible, Instagram and Facebook appeared to receive only a modest increase in daily active users and downloads, according to the market research firm Sensor Tower.\nAt least so far, many of Meta’s overtures have been met with suspicion. When TikTok came back online, conspiracy theories began spreading on the platform that Meta was going to take a stake in the company. Horrified creators specifically pointed to what they believed was a “new” official Facebook profile on TikTok as evidence. In reality, however, screenshots from the Internet Archive show that the account has existed since at least 2022.",

    "content_text": "Broadcast TV seems a little screwed. Viewership has been on a steady decline for the past two decades. More and more people get their entertainment and their news online. The biggest shows are coming to streaming first, and broadcast’s biggest shows are losing their big-name hosts. Naturally ad revenue is on a steady decline as well. Even Trump and his choice for Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, are rattling their sabers and threatening to pull the broadcast licenses of networks that run programs or news stories the White House doesn’t like.\nIt can feel like broadcast television will be gone tomorrow, and with it one of the only totally free sources of news and entertainment.\nThat’s what’s so crucial about broadcast TV. While it does require a television and a digital tuner to watch, there’s no monthly fee for internet or service, and unlike YouTube or Instagram, no company is collecting enormous amounts of data on you to sell to advertisers. It’s a completely passive experience. The stations air sports and news and entertainment, and you can tune in or not. And people are not tuning in.\n“Our expectation is it’s going to decline,” says Rose Oberman, media and entertainment director at S&P Global Ratings, though she noted that decline would happen over years, not months, and likened TV’s slide to what’s happened to radio over the past couple of decades. There’s no sudden collapse in broadcast TV’s future, just a steady chipping away as audiences move from paying for cable to paying for streaming.\nTake sports as an example. Events like the Olympics and the Super Bowl were once reliable audience drivers, but in 2024 the Super Bowl streamed on Paramount Plus. The experience was buggy and stuttering, but Paramount Plus still garnered 3.4 million more subscribers than it had before the game. The Olympics, which were simulcast on Peacock, experienced even more online success. People liked that they could just watch the events they wanted on demand and skip anything they didn’t.\nThen, at Christmas, sports streaming experienced its biggest event to date when Netflix successfully streamed two NFL games (and a flashy Beyoncé-starring half-time show). Nary a complaint of stuttering in sight. Afterward, Netflix claimed they were the most streamed games in NFL history.\nStreaming’s big sports win won’t immediately snuff out sports on broadcast TV—there are contracts in place keeping live games on the air. Yet as those contracts come up for renewal, leagues may opt to take their games elsewhere, particularly as broadcast becomes less profitable and viewers switch to streaming. Right now the networks spend billions to air NFL games, but companies like Netflix and Amazon have deeper pockets, and they’ve shown they have no problem paying big money to snatch rights out from under legacy media networks. Amazon agreed to pay $1 billion a year to secure the rights to NFL Thursday Night Football back in 2021. Fox was previously paying about $660 million annually for those games.\nThe belt-tightening has already hit another big money driver of network TV: the morning show. In early January, Hoda Kotb left the Today show after 17 years. The broadcast journalist was reportedly making more than $20 million a year as a host, and NBC just didn’t want to keep paying that. That’s also why the network axed the band on Late Night With Seth Meyers and dropped the number of weekly episodes of The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon from five to four. They’re all signs of what Variety called “TV’s new austerity push.”\n“We do have audiences going to different places to watch their programming,” one agent told Variety. “A number of these entities are seeing their revenues decline. That’s just a fact of life.”\nBut with broadcast TV’s audience now fractured across streaming, cable, and social media, why is Donald Trump threatening its existence? “This is a political cudgel being used against national news networks,” says David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Greene noted that Trump’s ire was focused more on national news outlets than the local stations that actually possess the broadcast licenses.\nSome networks do own local stations. Paramount, which also produces CBS’s 60 Minutes, owns a handful, and was even exploring selling 12 of them back in August before Trump lobbed his latest threats toward the network. But when I asked Oberman about those threats, she said she hadn’t “really heard it was an area of concern” for the industry. “If anything the incoming administration is more pro-friendly to the broadcasters.”\nPerry Sook, the CEO of Nexstar, the largest television station owner in the US, is hopeful that the new administration will remove rules capping the number of local stations a company can own. On a November 2024 earnings call, Sook clearly stated what kind of journalism he’d like to see on those stations. “[I]t seems as though there may be a kinder, gentler consensus emerging, that maybe fact-based journalism will come back into vogue, as well as eliminating the level of activist journalism out there,” he said on the call.\nSinclair, the second largest owner of TV stations in the US, is also eager for more consolidation, and has gained a reputation for directing its local stations to cover the news with a POV more in line with Sinclair’s own conservative political leanings. Sinclair was the subject of a 2018 viral video that showed dozens of newscasters from across the US reading the exact same script criticizing the media that repeated common conservative talking points.\nBut the Trump administration and the big owners of broadcast licenses aren’t just friendly because of their shared political leanings. According to Orman, local stations also tend to have better reach when it comes to political advertising. “Digital doesn’t seem to be giving political advertisers the return they’re expecting, and TV still seems to give that,” Orman told Ad Exchanger late last year. Broadcast TV actually saw its ad revenue increase by 9 percent in 2024, an uptick due entirely to increased spending on political ads during the major election cycle.\nWith the election in the rearview, that ad money is drying up. And with viewership fading and streaming outspending the networks hand over fist, one of the world’s oldest media institutions has its back against the wall. Even if the incoming administration fails to make good on its promise to punish media outlets that run stories it finds offensive, broadcast TV is entering a period of existential uncertainty.\n“Broadcast is so vulnerable right now,” says the EFF’s Greene, “any threat against it seems to be a danger.”",

But when I asked Oberman about those threats, she said she hadn’t “really heard it was an area of concern” for the industry. “If anything the incoming administration is more pro-friendly to the broadcasters.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Perry Sook, the CEO of Nexstar, the largest television station owner in the US, is hopeful that the new administration will remove rules capping the number of local stations a company can own.

    "content_text": "The video game industry has been in a troubled place for the past year, with studio closures and job security at the forefront of developer concerns. Increasing layoffs with seemingly no end paint a bleak picture for devs, while companies are busy pumping money into AI initiatives.\nAccording to a new report from the organizers of the Game Developers Conference, 52 percent of devs surveyed said they worked at companies that were using generative AI on their games. Of the 3,000 people surveyed, roughly half said they were concerned about the technology’s impact on the industry and an increasing number reported they felt negatively about AI overall. The “State of the Game Industry” report, released Tuesday, is one of a series of surveys conducted each year by GDC organizers prior to their annual conference. This year’s event will take place in San Francisco in March.\nThe 2025 GDC report comes on the heels of a tumultuous couple of years in the industry. Even as games like Astro Bot, Helldivers 2, and Balatro found success, studios like Microsoft and Sony have slashed staff and canceled games. Amid a mix of cultural and economic factors impacting the industry, developers are also still dealing with company enthusiasm for technology that some find ethically concerning.\n“I have a PhD in AI, worked to develop some of the algorithms used by generative AI,” one developer wrote. “I deeply regret how naively I offered up my contributions.”\nSome 30 percent of the developers who responded to the survey said they felt negatively about AI, opposed to 18 percent last year; only 13 percent believed AI was having a positive impact on games, down from 21 percent in 2024. “No matter how you put it, generative AI isn’t a great replacement for real people and quality is going to be damaged,” another developer wrote in their response.\nFor developers, AI has the potential to help with several tasks, respondents said, including coding, concept art, and 3D model generation, but when asked what uses they saw for AI in the industry, “the word used most frequently in their responses was ‘none,’” GDC organizers wrote.\nIn theory, generative AI could help some developers lighten their workloads. That’s not happening. Instead, developers are reportedly working longer hours than they have in years. Thirteen percent of respondents reported putting in 51-plus-hour weeks, up from 8 percent of respondents last year. While those additional hours could be attributed to devs taking on additional work to make up for colleagues lost during 2024’s massive industry-wide layoffs, many voiced concerns that AI was also a factor. “We should use generative AI to help people be faster at their jobs, not lose them,” one worker wrote.\nLayoffs, the story of the industry for the past several years, still pose a huge problem. “Survive till ’25,” the mantra for struggling developers, hardly helped those who did lose their jobs. According to the survey, one in 10 developers have been laid off over the last year. There was also an increase in “N/A” responses: “the question didn’t apply because they were already laid off or otherwise unemployed. In other words, it wasn’t a concern now because, in some way, it had already happened to them.”\nOf those who have already lost their jobs, many reported difficulty in finding new employment. Some said they were still out of work more than a year later, with one reporting they’d sent 500 applications to no avail. “I’ve been laid off before, but this was by far the longest it’s taken me to find work. It was scary, and my life was flipped upside down,” one developer wrote.\nSaid another: “I have been laid off three times in the last year. The first two times I was able to find a role. My current studio just laid everyone off. I was only there four months, and haven't found anything yet.”\nEven once they’ve landed a new job, it’s a coin toss on conditions. While one developer said they were able to quickly find another role in a better position, another said their new job is a “way worse pay level.”\nDevelopers blame problems like over-expansion in the wake of Covid-19, unrealistic expectations on game success, and poor leadership and mismanagement. “In this industry, we set impossible goals and then fire everyone if they prove to be impossible,” wrote one respondent. “We need to apply lean and agile processes instead of shooting for the moon every single time.”",

    "content_text": "On his first day in office, President Trump has signed a slew of executive orders that will set the United States on a radically different environmental path from the Biden administration. The executive orders and memoranda take the first steps to fulfilling many of Trump’s promises from the campaign trail: withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement, drilling more oil and natural gas, and repealing multiple Biden-era environmental directives and departments.\nWhile Trump’s day-one executive orders are far-reaching, it’s not yet clear how they will be implemented or how quickly they will be felt. Executive orders direct government agencies how to implement the law, but they can be challenged by courts if they appear to violate the US Constitution or other laws, as happened with Trump’s travel ban executive order in January 2017.\nTrump’s executive orders do, however, send a clear signal about his administration’s environmental priorities: extracting more fossil fuels, weakening support for green energy, and stepping away from global climate leadership.\nWithdrawing From the Paris Agreement\nThis executive order instructs the US Ambassador to the United Nations to submit formal notification that the US is withdrawing from the Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2016, commits countries to reduce greenhouse emissions and submit five-yearly updates on their climate plans to reach agreed goals on reducing emissions.\nIn his first term, Trump also withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement, although the terms of the agreement meant that the withdrawal did not take place until November 2020. In one of his very first acts as president, Joe Biden had the US rejoin the Paris Agreement. It will take at least a year for the US to leave the Agreement.\n“This short-sighted move shows a disregard for science and the well-being of people around the world, including Americans, who are already losing their homes, livelihoods, and loved ones as a result of climate change,” says Jonathan Foley, executive director of the climate charity Project Drawdown.\nThe executive order also rescinds the US International Climate Finance Plan—a Biden administration increase in international climate finance that reached over $11 billion a year by 2024. “Essentially it’s the world’s richest country turning its back on the the poorest countries at the time when they are suffering the most,” says Bob Ward, policy director at the London School of Economics’ Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change the the Environment.\nEncouraging Fossil Fuel Extraction\nPresident Trump dedicated three executive orders to making it easier for the US to exploit its vast fossil fuel reserves. On the campaign trail Trump consistently promised to “drill, baby, drill,” and in his first day as president he underscored this sloganeering with orders to remove Biden-era regulations and environmental rules that restrict fossil fuel exploration.\nOne executive order focuses specifically on Alaska, which has vast fossil fuel reserves and was the location for Willow—a controversial oil and gas project approved by the Biden administration in 2023. Trump’s executive order opens the doors wide open to other projects, calling for the US to “expedite the permitting and leasing of energy and natural resource projects” in Alaska and the revocation of any regulations passed by the Biden administration that may hinder this aim. It also specifically rescinds the cancellation of leases within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and withdraws an order from the Secretary of the Interior that temporarily paused oil and gas leasing in the refuge.\nA second executive order declared a national energy emergency, stating that the US energy production was “far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs.” The order instructs the heads of government agencies to use emergency authorities in order to identify, lease, and exploit domestic energy resources.\nA third executive order under the title “Unleashing American Energy” covers a wide range of policies, including encouraging energy production on federal land and waters, making the US the leader in non-fuel miners, including rare earth miners, and terminating state-level emissions waivers and subsidies for EVs. The order also promises to “safeguard the American people’s freedom to choose” lightbulbs, dishwashers, washing machines, gas stoves, and other appliances, in an apparent nod to the controversy over New York’s law banning natural gas stoves in new homes and buildings.\n“The US will no longer be in a leadership position on these issues. It’s going to have real economic consequences for the US that will come back to bite President Trump before the end of this term,” says Ward, adding that the US will lose ground to China particularly in terms of electric vehicles and political leadership on climate change.\n“China will be the one now seen as being the world leader on this and will be able to establish lots of economic and diplomatic links with other countries at a time when the US will look to be completely hopeless on this issue.”\nSuspending New Offshore Wind Farms\nIn an executive memorandum, Trump suspended all new leasing for offshore wind farms, citing “growing demand for reliable energy” and “impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns.” The memorandum temporarily prevents the consideration of wind farm leases in areas on the US outer continental shelf—parts of the ocean floor that lie beyond state coastal waters.\nExecutive memoranda are similar to executive orders, but they are not required to cite the President’s legal authority, and the Office of Management and Budget is not required to issue a “Budgetary Impact Statement” as is the case with executive orders.\nRedirecting Water in California\nIn another memorandum, Trump picked up a policy from his first administration—a plan to route water from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta to other parts of the state. This plan was signed-off by Trump in 2020 but was challenged in court by California governor Gavin Newsom and the state of California. Trump has repeatedly blamed this delay on “worthless fish,” arguing that environmental rules have slowed the building of water infrastructure in California.\nThe memorandum—titled “Putting People Over Fish”—explicitly calls out “radical environmentalism,” which Trump implies is behind the delay to his infrastructure project. “This catastrophic halt was allegedly in protection of the Delta smelt and other species of fish,” the text of the memorandum reads.\nUndoing Biden-Era Climate Projects\nIn the same executive order that “unleashed” US fossil fuel exploitation, Trump revoked Biden-era executive orders and actions that set up new organizations to tackle climate change. This includes Executive Order 14008, which established a National Climate Task Force, most recently chaired by National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi.",

It will take at least a year for the US to leave the Agreement.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“This short-sighted move shows a disregard for science and the well-being of people around the world, including Americans, who are already <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/wildfires/\">losing their homes</a>, livelihoods, and loved ones as a result of climate change,” says Jonathan Foley, executive director of the climate charity Project Drawdown.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The executive order also rescinds the US International Climate Finance Plan—a Biden administration increase in international climate finance that reached over $11 billion a year by 2024. “Essentially it’s the world’s richest country turning its back on the the poorest countries at the time when they are suffering the most,” says Bob Ward, policy director at the London School of Economics’ Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change the the Environment.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Encouraging Fossil Fuel Extraction</h2><p class=\"paywall\">President Trump dedicated three executive orders to making it easier for the US to exploit its vast fossil fuel reserves. On the campaign trail Trump consistently promised to “drill, baby, drill,” and in his first day as president he underscored this sloganeering with orders to remove Biden-era regulations and environmental rules that restrict fossil fuel exploration.</p><p class=\"paywall\">One executive order focuses specifically on Alaska, which has vast fossil fuel reserves and was the location for Willow—a controversial oil and gas project approved by the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-administration-approves-willow-oil-project-alaska-2023-03-13/\">Biden administration in 2023</a>. Trump’s executive order opens the doors wide open to other projects, calling for the US to “expedite the permitting and leasing of energy and natural resource projects” in Alaska and the revocation of any regulations passed by the Biden administration that may hinder this aim. It also specifically rescinds the cancellation of leases within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and withdraws an order from the Secretary of the Interior that temporarily paused oil and gas leasing in the refuge.</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIt's totally understandable if you haven’t opened Apple Maps since its disastrous launch in 2012, which among other things saw people driving into riverbanks. It was not a launch that inspired confidence. That was over a decade ago, though, which is an eternity in the world of software. After years of refinement, Apple Maps is pretty good now.\nI switch between Google Maps and Apple Maps regularly, mostly as an experiment, and at this point I think Apple's product is just as reliable as Google's for turn-by-turn directions. Sure, Google is more likely to have a given business in its database, especially if that business is new. If you type the same address into both apps, though, they work about as well as each other for navigation.\nAnd I'll go even further: There are some things Apple Maps does better than Google. Not all of them are going to matter to all people, granted, but they exist. Here's a quick roundup.\nLittle Audio Details\nApple Maps, in my opinion, is better at explaining in plain language what you need to do next while you’re driving. For example: Google Maps, when a turn is upcoming, will tell you to turn at a specific street after a certain number of feet. This, while technically correct, almost always leaves me feeling confused. Apple Maps, meanwhile, will tell me to pass the next traffic light and turn right at the one after it. That, to me, is a much clearer instruction. There are a lot of similar interactions. It feels like having a really good navigator sitting next to you.\nI also generally find Apple's voices to be both clearer and more expressive, though that's possibly subjective.\nQuickly Check Transit Times\nApple Maps has a transit feature called \"Nearby transit\" that just shows a list of the incoming buses and trains near where I'm standing. I use this while waiting for a train at a stop and also when I'm almost ready to leave a bar or restaurant—I can quickly see the next few transit options and time my departure accordingly.\nGoogle doesn't offer a feature like this. You can ask for directions using transit, sure, and those directions will take arrival times into account. You can also get a list of arrival times if you tap a specific bus station, which is useful in some circumstances, but you can't just get a quick list of upcoming arrival times at all the stations near you, which is better if you’re trying to decide between multiple options. Google should probably steal this feature, since it's really nice to have.\nIntegration With Apple’s Ecosystem\nI'm a fan of messing around with Apple Shortcuts, the automation platform built into Apple devices. For example: I added a \"Save my parking spot\" button to my phone's homepage. I couldn't build a shortcut like that for Google Maps because Google doesn't offer any kind of Apple Shortcuts integration. This is just one example of how Google doesn't go out of its way to integrate with Apple's ecosystem.\nAnd then there are the integrations built into Apple apps and features. The calendar app on my Mac and iPhone default to opening maps when I tap an address. Siri defaults to using Maps if I ask for directions. If an Apple app offers directions it's going to work through Apple Maps. You could call this unfair, sure, but Google does the same thing on Android. Google Maps is tightly integrated with the rest of the company's mobile OS, and that integration can make life easier for people who use those native services.\nIt’s Just Cleaner\nGoogle Maps, over time, has had more and more stuff grafted onto it. Nothing makes this more obvious than opening both apps and noticing the contrast. Apple Maps sports fewer toolbars, fewer buttons, and in my opinion the geographic references offered on the map itself are more likely to be useful (possibly because, unlike with Google, fewer of them are paid advertisements).\nNow, I'm hardly the first person to point out that an Apple application is cleaner than a Google one, and I'll be the first to admit that the extent of this difference is subjective. But I think Apple's design does a better job of staying out of your way, which matters when you're just trying to get around.\nMe pointing these things out is not meant to imply that Google Maps does nothing better than Apple Maps. Google’s platform has a massive head start in terms of information about businesses, for one thing, and even after a decade Apple hasn't caught up. I've noticed this in particular during a recent trip to Peru, where Apple Maps was basically useless. I'm sure people will get in touch with me pointing out other things that Google does better, which is fine. I just mean to say that Apple Maps is pretty good now and that in a few ways I actually find it better than Google Maps.\nIf you haven't tried out Apple Maps in a while, I recommend you do. You might be surprised.",

    "content_text": "Fire has always shaped the landscape in California. But today it burns hotter, more frequently, and spreads farther than ever before—a shift driven by human development, climate change, and the prevalence of invasive species, which are non-native plants that have negative effects on local ecosystems. Grasses and trees brought to California for agriculture, landscaping, or by accident, have transformed the state’s fire dynamics.\n“Many non-native species can propagate fire faster than native plants,” says David Acuña, battalion chief for Cal Fire, the state’s department of forestry and fire protection. This transformation is an overlooked driver for the increasingly destructive wildfires in California and around the world.\nSouthern California is dominated by shrublands known as chaparral. This landscape was historically characterized by short, shrubby plants, and any native grasses were perennial, maintaining moisture and staying green for most of the year. Fires, when they occurred, were rare because lightning strikes were infrequent. When fires did ignite, they burned hot but wouldn’t spread far because the open gaps between plants acted as natural firebreaks.\nThe introduction of non-native grasses in the 1700s fundamentally altered this balance. Brought by European settlers, these grasses evolved alongside heavy livestock grazing and routine burning, making them highly resilient to disturbance. They outcompeted native species and filled the gaps in shrublands, creating a continuous carpet of flammable material, especially along altered areas like roadways—frequent starting points for fires.\nUnlike perennial native grasses, these non-native grasses are annuals, meaning they die each year and regrow from seeds. Their short life cycle leaves behind a dense layer of dry, dead vegetation by late spring. “They have such a high surface area to volume and are very flat and thin, so they maintain a lot of dead standing material, almost all year round,” says Carla D’Antonio, a plant community researcher and professor at UC Santa Barbara. By May, dead grass blankets the ground. “It’s so flammable that it takes any ignition—a cigarette, a spark from someone dragging a chain on the highway, or lightning,” says Hugh Safford, a vegetation and fire ecology researcher at UC Davis.\nThe grasses fill every available space—a phenomenon called fuel continuity. When fires spark, the uninterrupted line of dry vegetation acts like a wick, carrying the flames into the shrublands. “People underestimate the destructiveness of grasses because you can go hack them down with a hoe quickly, whereas a shrub is pretty hard to cut down,” says D’Antonio. “But if the sparks and embers fly into a bunch of introduced grasses, then—boom—everything around you just goes up like gasoline. It spreads so fast, and it’s so continuous. It’s like throwing tissue paper onto a fire.”\nEucalyptus trees, introduced to California in the mid-19th century from Australia, add another layer of fire risk. Known for their aromatic scent, these trees have incredibly flammable, oily leaves. Their papery bark sloughs off and catches in the wind, transporting embers up to half a mile away. The problem comes when people plant them right next to their home, says Acuña. “You put a very hot, very vigorous-burning plant like a eucalyptus tree next to a house, which is primarily composed of petroleum materials. That’s a very strong fire,” he explains.\nThe 1991 Tunnel Fire in Oakland, California, ignited debates—and multiple lawsuits—about whether to remove the widespread eucalyptus. “People want to keep them because they’re iconic, but wow, they are so freaking flammable,” says Safford. Yet in terms of a landscape-scale issue, Safford emphasizes that grasses remain a bigger concern.\nBut it’s not just California; invasive species have created fire hazards worldwide. Eucalyptus plantations have contributed to massive wildfires in Portugal, and grass fires have spread everywhere from the Great Basin in the American West to tropical forests in Chile. “It’s a major threat to native ecosystems around the world,” says Safford. “There’s a lot of international interest, so if someone could figure out just how to control grass, I think that would be quite a find.”\nVegetation management plays a critical role for fire mitigation: “The best way people are managing grass right now is just by hand-cutting roadsides and having crews out there every spring,” says D’Antonio. “I live in the mountains, and our community has a roadside group that goes out with volunteers and clears the roadsides and rakes off all that dead grass every year.” However, this shouldn’t be conflated with President Trump’s misleading claims from 2019 about “raking the forest floor” that resurfaced on social media during the LA wildfires. (It may work for tracts of grass along roadways, but not woody debris on forest floors.) And while raking is one method of vegetation management, effective fire prevention requires a broader approach, including controlled burns, strategic grazing, and clearing dead vegetation from key areas.\nIn some areas, sheep grazing is being tested as a low-impact way to manage grass growth. Some areas in Southern California are even testing a “BurnBot,” a machine that travels over the ground, performing controlled burns by torching anything directly underneath it—clearing both existing vegetation and plant seeds.\nD’Antonio and her graduate students are researching ways to replace these fire-prone areas with native grasses that are more fire-resilient. “Once they’re established, they’re fairly deep-rooted and they can access soil moisture deeper, so they stay more moist during the summer,” she explains. “Our goal is to create a community of native perennial grasses that can maintain itself so we don’t have to do constant maintenance.”\nHomeowners also have an important role to play. “Everybody wants to blame the Forest Service when a fire rips through, right? But we chose to live in this landscape,” says D’Antonio. “So start with your home.” Acuña says that Cal Fire provides tips for home- and landowners looking to fire-proof their property through landscaping and creating defensible space.\nUltimately, invasive plants are a problem that requires collective action—community involvement, responsible land-management practices, and forward-thinking research to restore native ecosystems. Without these efforts, California’s wildfire crisis will only intensify, fueled by plants never meant to be here in the first place.",

    "content_text": "After the presidential election, many fashion and lifestyle influencers began to come out of the closet as conservatives. Some, like tradwife TikTok darling Nara Smith, were predictable, while others were less so. But what was clear was that MAGA culture, and the fashion and aesthetics associated with it, were becoming increasingly mainstream.\nInauguration weekend, with its mix of parties and formal events, brought together the who’s who of right-wing players. Observing the proceedings was Derek Guy, known online as @dieworkwear—a longtime menswear enthusiast and writer who has came to prominence as an influencer on X for his hot and unnervingly well-informed takes on the sartorial choices of everyone from Donald Trump to Andrew Tate, and what they might be telling us about this political moment.\nWIRED spoke with Guy after Monday’s inauguration ceremony to get his takes on MAGA fashion, what it says about who the party is for, and what the richest men alive are wearing these days.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nWIRED: First, give us the reviews of the inauguration suits and ties. What are we looking at here? These are some of the richest men in the world, but I’m not sure they really look like it.\nDerek Guy: You can break up the inauguration almost by age. The older someone is, the more likely they are at least avoiding the worst of what we're seeing. And the younger someone is, the more likely they are wearing something that looks cheap, because tailoring as a craft has mostly died in this country. Many people shop ready-to-wear. And when you're very wealthy, you are probably just buying a luxury-level off-the-rack suit. And just because something is made with fine materials doesn't necessarily mean it fits. So you have a market system that makes it difficult to find a good suit.\nIf you're younger, like Mark Zuckerberg's age, you're more likely to kind of fall into this short-jacket silhouette that you think looks modern and hip but frankly looks really dated and makes you actually look more middle-aged, like someone who learned how to dress in the early 2000s.\nVivek [Ramaswamy], for example, wears really shrunken suits. Jeff Bezos often wears pretty good tailoring but today wore a very short jacket which did not look very good on him. He looked surprisingly bad today, given how he looks in tailored clothing other times.\nElon Musk, I'm pretty sure he wears a Tom Ford suit, because that's five buttons on the cuffs. I thought it looked pretty good on him, but he looked bad at the rally last night. He was wearing a short overcoat with gray jeans, and it didn’t flatter him very well. The outfit didn’t make much sense.\nZuckerberg, his suits are neither fantastic nor horrible. Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, they are still clearly nerds who don’t care about clothes.\nBut, you know, for example, JD Vance has a custom tailor. He has a 90-year-old Italian tailor in Ohio. That guy is not following fashion trends.\nWhy do the rank-and-file MAGA enthusiasts favor such slim-fit suits when Trump himself often wears things that are quite baggy?\nWhat you're seeing is young conservatives will often wear very shrunken suits because they care more about the tailored aesthetic. Ironically, you actually look better if you're the kind of young Democrat who doesn't care about aesthetics at all. So then you wear a sloppy suit. You still look bad, but you essentially avoid the shrunken look. The MAGA aesthetic will change over time as conservatives change their tastes naturally. But I mean, just to be frank about it, many conservatives are often behind on fashion trends.\nWe are at this moment where the large part of the market has shifted away from the shrunken look of the early 2000s. But if you're kind of behind on fashion trends, you still think that looks good.\nAre you seeing changes to the hallmarks of the MAGA aesthetic, particularly as we're seeing it merge a bit with the quiet luxury vibe that became very popular online?\nMAGA is a very populist aesthetic, so it's intentionally vulgar and thumbing its nose at WASP morality and aesthetics, even though within the Republican Party there is still that kind of celebration of bourgeois 1950s aesthetics.\nI often like to contrast it. When Ronald Reagan and George Bush were first inaugurated in 1980, the Republican Party commissioned custom blazer buttons commemorating their inauguration, and they gave them out for free to attendees at the various events surrounding the inauguration. So if you attended Reagan's inauguration in 1980, you would have gotten a brass button commemorating the inauguration, made by Ben Silver in Charleston, South Carolina. It was presumed that people who attended Reagan's inauguration would have a navy tailored jacket. And if you put brass buttons on a navy jacket then that jacket becomes a blazer. It was presumed that not only would young Republicans have a navy jacket, but that they would want to wear a blazer with a button commemorating Reagan's victory.\nThe merchandise surrounding Trump's movement is gold sneakers and Never Surrender T-shirts and, of course, the red MAGA hat.\nTo me, this demonstrates the schism between the classic Republican—which is the Brooks Brothers, free-trade, globalist, Reaganite Republican—and the new Republican, which is populist. They pay reverence to Reagan, but they don't share his politics.\nThe aesthetic is very much not the classic WASP aesthetic, which used to be the Republican aesthetic. Trump's own aesthetic comes from the 1980s—the “greed is good” of Wall Street boom times. He wears very padded shoulders and a power tie. He used to wear a banker collar, but no longer. And that's very different from the demure look of Brooks Brothers WASP. MAGA is a very aggressive, populist “fuck you” to the establishment aesthetic.\nWhen you think about the MAGA aesthetic, are there particular brands or influencers who come to mind for you?\nIt's all very campaign merch, and the most mainstream item is just the MAGA hat. It still seems very much like campaign merch. I don't think there's anyone else that sets the tone except for Trump. There are certain people that embody that look very well. Forgiato Blow, he has that kind of very loud aesthetic. There was a moment where Viper sunglasses were very popular, which was, I think, driven by Baked Alaska. So there are microtrends in that universe. But it’s really Trump—whatever he releases next, people will wear.\nDo you think that sort of classic American look—the Ralph Lauren, the oxford shirt—is that going to be sort of the purview of MAGA forever, or do you see that changing?\nI don't think the classic American aesthetic is strictly MAGA, though. I think a Brooks Brothers look is like the ABC of menswear; that's like a very classic American tailored look. In the postwar period, right after the end of the Second World War, there was a culture clash between establishment lifestyle–the man in a gray flannel suit who works in a corporate job and has a conventional kind of nuclear family and white-picket-fence house—and the counterculture. That was this kind of liberal side of the political spectrum. They wore work wear and chambray shirts, hippie gear, motorcycle jackets. That all became counterculture.\nBut if you go back further than that, everyone wore tailored clothing, from criminals to CEOs to liberals and Republicans. Ralph Lauren could not have built his empire if button-down shirts and penny loafers were exclusively conservative attire.\nI think it's interesting that the current status of Republican politics is trying to unite the Brooks Brothers aesthetic with the gold sneakers. Do you see them coming together?\nI think that's the weird dichotomy at the moment, because the MAGA movement and Republicans in general have always been kind of looking back toward some idea of America. Even though not every man wore a suit in the 1950s, the suit has historically been associated with the kind of bourgeois lifestyle. And a lot of conservatism in general is about upholding bourgeois lifestyles, morality, identity, politics, and so forth.\nThere is now a populist section of the Republican Party that's not about Reaganism or Bush. It's very about Trump. And its aesthetic is very different from what William Buckley would have worn. William Buckley would not have worn gold sneakers.\nI think they are distinct and contradictory, but people can hold contradictory ideas in their head. We are in an age where politics is very tribal. And so long as it fits the narrative of our tribe, then I think it's coherent for that group. For Republicans, I think those two very contradictory aesthetics are just now within the party.\nThe men of tech are new to the MAGA crowd, but many people have noted a significant change in their looks, particularly Mark Zuckerberg’s. Can you talk about what they’re trying to signal and to whom?\nI heard through the grapevine within my industry that [Elon Musk] used to have a stylist. I don’t think he has a stylist anymore. Mark Zuckerberg denies having a stylist, but I don’t believe him. He is certainly going through a style transformation in the last year and three months, I would say. Jeff Bezos most obviously has a stylist. I don't think what they're doing has anything to do with politics. I think Jeff Bezos went through a style makeover after his divorce. And I suspect Mark Zuckerberg just got tired of dressing like a college student. Elon has clearly given up on his stylist and doesn’t dress very well.\n[Zuckerberg] dresses more like an MMA guy. He is wearing the boxy tees and the gold chain. But he looks like someone who updated his look to be trendier. There are a lot of guys wearing that kind of silhouette and gold chain, and I don’t know that that says anything about their politics.\nWe saw a lot of the sort of “spaghetti Western” vibe happening. What’s your take on that?\nAs a fashion trend, the Western look really leans more liberal, right now, because it’s popular in big cities. Conservatives now dress like metrosexuals in the early 2000s, and liberals dress like Bush-era conservatives.

    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Do you think that sort of classic American look—the Ralph Lauren, the oxford shirt—is that going to be sort of the purview of MAGA forever, or do you see that changing?</strong></p><p class=\"paywall\">I don't think the classic American aesthetic is strictly MAGA, though. I think a Brooks Brothers look is like the ABC of menswear; that's like a very classic American tailored look. In the postwar period, right after the end of the Second World War, there was a culture clash between establishment lifestyle–the man in a gray flannel suit who works in a corporate job and has a conventional kind of nuclear family and white-picket-fence house—and the counterculture. That was this kind of liberal side of the political spectrum. They wore work wear and chambray shirts, hippie gear, motorcycle jackets. That all became counterculture.</p><p class=\"paywall\">But if you go back further than that, everyone wore tailored clothing, from criminals to CEOs to liberals and Republicans. Ralph Lauren could not have built his empire if button-down shirts and penny loafers were exclusively conservative attire.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>I think it's interesting that the current status of Republican politics is trying to unite the Brooks Brothers aesthetic with the gold sneakers. Do you see them coming together?</strong></p><p class=\"paywall\">I think that's the weird dichotomy at the moment, because the MAGA movement and Republicans in general have always been kind of looking back toward some idea of America. Even though not every man wore a suit in the 1950s, the suit has historically been associated with the kind of bourgeois lifestyle. And a lot of conservatism in general is about upholding bourgeois lifestyles, morality, identity, politics, and so forth.</p><p class=\"paywall\">There is now a populist section of the Republican Party that's not about Reaganism or Bush. It's very about Trump. And its aesthetic is very different from what William Buckley would have worn. William Buckley would not have worn gold sneakers.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I think they are distinct and contradictory, but people can hold contradictory ideas in their head. We are in an age where politics is very tribal. And so long as it fits the narrative of our tribe, then I think it's coherent for that group. For Republicans, I think those two very contradictory aesthetics are just now within the party.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>The men of tech are new to the MAGA crowd, but many people have noted a significant change in their looks, particularly Mark Zuckerberg’s. Can you talk about what they’re trying to signal and to whom?</strong></p><p class=\"paywall\">I heard through the grapevine within my industry that [Elon Musk] used to have a stylist. I don’t think he has a stylist anymore. Mark Zuckerberg denies having a stylist, but I don’t believe him. He is certainly going through a style transformation in the last year and three months, I would say. Jeff Bezos most obviously has a stylist. I don't think what they're doing has anything to do with politics. I think Jeff Bezos went through a style makeover after his divorce. And I suspect Mark Zuckerberg just got tired of dressing like a college student. Elon has clearly given up on his stylist and doesn’t dress very well.</p><p class=\"paywall\">[Zuckerberg] dresses more like an MMA guy. He is wearing the boxy tees and the gold chain. But he looks like someone who updated his look to be trendier. There are a lot of guys wearing that kind of silhouette and gold chain, and I don’t know that that says anything about their politics.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>We saw a lot of the sort of “spaghetti Western” vibe happening. What’s your take on that?</strong></p><p class=\"paywall\">As a fashion trend, the Western look really leans more liberal, right now, because it’s popular in big cities. Conservatives now dress like metrosexuals in the early 2000s, and liberals dress like Bush-era conservatives. Conservatives are in slim-tight suits or slim-fit suits, and then liberals are like Carhartt double-knees, Western shirts, cowboy boots. There is some of this inherently on the right because it's a Midwestern look.</p><p class=\"paywall\">But Elon Musk does wear cowboy boots pretty frequently, as does Jeff Bezos.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Shortly after Monday’s inauguration ceremony, President Donald Trump signed an executive order extending the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US operations, preventing the app from going dark for an additional 75 days.\nThe executive order instructs the US Attorney General to abstain from enforcing the law that would ban the app and require companies like Apple and Google to remove it from their app stores. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDays before the January 19 deadline, Trump suggested that he would “save” the app once he formally took office. In an interview with Kristen Welker at NBC News on Saturday, Trump said that he would give ByteDance more time to find a buyer but did not explain how he planned to do so. “We have to look at it carefully. It’s a very big situation,” he said.\nIn a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump confirmed that the extension would be done by way of an executive order that would allow his administration to negotiate a deal with ByteDance. In his post, Trump said that he would pursue a 50 percent joint venture agreement with ByteDance, preferably with a US entity.\n“By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to [stay] up,” Trump wrote. “Without US approval, there is no TikTok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars—maybe trillions.”\nByteDance and TikTok have yet to publicly respond to Trump’s proposal. At the Monday signing ceremony, Trump said that he thinks TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew would “really like it.” Trump said private companies could be involved in financing the negotiation. “I think you have a lot of people that will be interested in TikTok with the United States as a partner,” he said.\nThe executive order itself doesn't mention divestiture but instead says that the 75-day reprieve is for the “opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way.”\nThe rush to keep TikTok online came after the company suffered a devastating blow at the hands of the US Supreme Court. On Friday, the court upheld a law forcing a sale of TikTok to an American owner in order to stave off a nationwide ban. The decision came only two days before the law was set to go into effect.\nShortly before midnight on Saturday, TikTok users received a notification alerting them that the app was no longer available to US users as a result of the sell-or-ban law. Around the same time Apple and Google removed the app from their app stores, other ByteDance-owned apps, including CapCut, Lemon8, and Marvel Snap, were also taken down. TikTok was down for around 15 hours before the company issued a statement announcing that it would return.\n“In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,” the company said Sunday evening.\nThe divestiture law has faced resentment from both sides of the aisle. “In Washington DC doing meetings trying to get this TikTok ban lifted,” wrote Soulja Boy in a post on X over the weekend. The rap artist was in town to perform at a crypto industry inauguration party.\nA variety of American financiers considered buying the app, including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt and former Trump treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin. McCourt’s Project Liberty made a formal bid after the Supreme Court announced its decision. Elon Musk’s name was also floated in talks about a deal with the Chinese government, according to Bloomberg.\nOn Monday, Trump suggested that he could impose retaliatory tariffs against China if the Chinese government refuses to negotiate a deal resolving the US government’s national security concerns with TikTok. “I’m not saying I would, but you could certainly do it,” he said.",

    "content_text": "Four Proud Boy leaders convicted of seditious conspiracy are among the hundreds of Capitol rioters who will walk free following pardons and sentence commutations issued by newly inaugurated president Donald Trump.\nEnrique Tarrio, who was the leader of the far-right gang at the time of the insurrection four years ago, had been sentenced to 22 years behind bars—the longest sentence received by any January 6 rioter. He received a pardon. His codefendants Zachary Rehl, Joseph Biggs, and Ethan Nordean, who were previously sentenced to 15, 17, and 18 years, had their sentences commuted and were ordered released as of Monday.\nTarrio’s mother Zuny Duarte told WIRED that Enrique will be back in Miami by 3 pm on Tuesday. He’s been serving his sentence at a federal prison in Pollock, Louisiana.\nTrump issued 14 sentence commutations and issued blanket pardons for all other individuals convicted in relation to the Capitol riot. Around 1,580 individuals in total were charged with crimes related to January 6.\n“These people have been destroyed, what they’ve done to these people is outrageous, there’s rarely been anything like it in the history of this country,” Trump said of the January 6-ers from the Oval Office. He also floated conspiracy theories that “outside agitators” and the FBI were somehow responsible for the violence that unfolded on January 6. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, who was also convicted of seditious conspiracy, also had his sentence commuted and will walk free.\nTrump had teased the pardons at his event earlier Monday at the Capital One Arena, promising an imminent release of “J6 hostages.”\n“Ooh, you’re going to be happy reading newspapers tomorrow and the next day and the next day,” he said.\nReached by phone earlier on Monday, Duarte told WIRED that they were anticipating Enrique’s release. “The guys are excited and think that justice will finally come to us,” said Duarte. “Donald Trump knows what it’s like to be on the side of the prosecuted and on the unjust side of things.”\nAsked whether Tarrio was still involved with the Proud Boys, Duarte responded: “That’s a question you need to ask him when he’s out.”\nBefore Trump had even put ink to paper, news that correctional facilities were beginning to process January 6 rioters for release had started percolating online. Social media accounts linked to the Proud Boys were jubilant, and Gavin McInnes, who founded the Proud Boys in 2016, declared “Party for the Boys” on a livestream of his show while collecting donations to support released members of the gang.\nAs a first-day act, it was a stunningly symbolic one. Four years ago, on January 6, 2021, thousands of Trump’s supporters galvanized by conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, came to DC and besieged the Capitol with the goal of preventing the peaceful transfer of power. The ugly scenes culminated in the deaths of five people and left more than 140 police officers injured, and Trump left Washington in disgrace.\nWeeks later, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the US behind riot barriers, barbed wire, and under the eyes of more than 25,000 national guard troops.\nThe FBI classified the Capitol riot as an act of domestic terrorism, and the DOJ has spent the years since trying to hold those involved in the riot to account, a massive and costly undertaking. Nearly 1,600 defendants have been hit with federal charges in connection to the riot.\nTrump has also been scrutinized for his role in the riot. In a recently released report, special counsel Jack Smith says that Trump would have surely faced criminal charges for his efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 election had he not won the presidential election in 2024. That would include, Smith wrote, directing “an angry mob to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification of the presidential election and then leverage rioters’ violence to further delay it.”\nOver the course of his 2024 campaign, Trump yoked his own litany of legal woes to those faced by the January 6 rioters, whom he started calling “hostages” of Joe Biden’s administration. In early 2022, he began floating the possibility of pardons for January 6-ers.\nIn addition to announcing pardons and commutations for rioters, Trump theatrically signed a flurry of executive orders from a desk set upon a stage in the Capital One Arena, including one “ENDING THE WEAPONIZATION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.” That order asserts that “the American people have witnessed the previous administration engage in a systematic campaign against its perceived political opponents.”",

Some elections are important, some are not, but this one really mattered,” Musk said during his address inside the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC, hours after Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. “And I just want to say thank you for making it happen. Thank you.”\nAt this point, Musk put his right hand on his chest before extending it straight out with his palm facing down and his fingers touching, a gesture widely recognized as the “Roman salute.” Adopted by the fascist movement a century ago, it was most famously used by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany, and is to this day associated with the fascist right, especially in Italy.\nAfter he first made the gesture, Musk then turned around to members of the crowd who were seated behind him and, with his back to the camera, repeated the gesture.\n“My heart goes out to you,” Musk added.\nMusk subsequently shared a clip of his speech on X, but at the point where he makes the first salute, the clip posted by Musk cuts away to a shot of the audience before returning to show him making the second salute.\nMusk, X, and the Trump administration did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but after this article was published Musk responded to the backlash in a post on X, writing: “Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.”\nThe response from the neo-Nazi community across the globe was instant and unanimous.\n“Incredible things are happening already,” Andrew Torba, the founder of Gab, a social media platform popular with antisemites and white supremacists, wrote over a picture of Musk giving the salute.\n“The entire neo-Nazi movement seems to be eating it up,” says Nick Martin, an investigative journalist who closely tracks extremist groups and runs the online publication The Informant. “He gave two unmistakable Nazi salutes, and they got the message loud and clear.”\n“WE ARE FUCKING BACK,” the administrator of a Nazi meme channel on Telegram wrote under a clip of Musk giving the salute. Members of the group responded with the lightning bolt emoji, a well-known neo-Nazi reference to the SS.\n“I don’t care if this was a mistake, I’m going to enjoy the tears over it,” Christopher Pohlhaus, the leader of the American neo-Nazi group Blood Tribe, wrote on his Telegram channel under a gif of the Musk salute.\nKeith Woods, a prominent far-right influencer from Ireland who has repeatedly praised Musk, responded to the actions by writing on X: “OK maybe woke really is dead.”\nEvan Kilgore, a right-wing political commentator, wrote on X: “Holy crap … did Elon Musk just Heil Hitler at the Trump Inauguration Rally in Washington DC … This is incredible.” Kilgore later wrote: “We are so back.”\nKilgore, who is a Holocaust denier, has worked as an ambassador for Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA. The conservative activist group hosted a pre-inauguration ball on Sunday evening that featured JD Vance, who was inaugurated as vice president today, and the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr.\nMusk has embraced far-right ideology and figures across the globe, including jailed Islamphobic activist Tommy Robinson in the UK, over the last two years. Most recently, he has promoted the German far-right political party Alternative for Germany. In an hour-long interview with the party’s leader, Alice Weidel, earlier this month, Musk agreed with the wild conspiracy theory that Hitler was a communist.\nThis article has been updated with a post from Elon Musk.",

    "content_text": "Late Friday evening, three days before his return to the Oval Office, Donald Trump performed an act of crypto alchemy. Pretty much all it took was a few strokes of the keyboard. “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE!” the incoming US president wrote in a Truth Social post. “It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!”\nThe post marked the launch of Trump’s very own memecoin—a type of joke cryptocurrency that typically has no purpose beyond financial speculation, whose value tends to whipsaw dramatically with changes in public sentiment.\nThe price of the TRUMP memecoin began to hare upwards almost immediately, despite speculation that Trump’s account had been hacked. By the following day, the coins released into circulation—20 percent of the total supply—were valued at $14 billion.\nOn Sunday, first lady Melania Trump followed with a memecoin of her own. At the time of writing, the circulating MELANIA coins are worth nearly $1 billion.\nBy virtue of the vast amounts of the TRUMP coin held back by Trump-affiliated entities, the incoming US president was suddenly connected to crypto coins with a theoretical value of more than $50 billion. The memecoin accounts for almost 90 percent of Trump’s net worth, Axios calculated.\nSome crypto boosters have celebrated the Trump family’s foray into memecoins, applauding the new president’s ability to transmute his fame into crypto wealth. But others have pointed to the thorny ethical issues at play; for Trump to enrich himself, someone else must pay.\n“Memecoins is absolutely a PvP [Player vs Player] game,” said Azeem Khan, cofounder of the Morph blockchain and venture partner at crypto VC firm Foresight Ventures, in an interview with WIRED late last year. “For someone to win, someone has to lose.”\nIn this case, Trump’s own supporters stand to potentially bear the cost. “It’s blatantly unethical,” alleges Christopher Bendiksen, a researcher at crypto asset management firm CoinShares. “Knowing that a bunch of [supporters] will lose money—and that money ends up in your pocket. Especially when you are holding the presidency of the United States.”\nThe press office for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe remaining 80 percent of TRUMP coins not yet released into circulation belong to two Trump-affiliated organizations: CIC Digital LLC—which has previously flogged Trump-branded sneakers, NFTs, and other merchandise—and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which was incorporated in early January. These organizations will receive the coins incrementally over a three-year period, the website states, generating revenue “derived from trading activities”—a euphemism for selling off the coins.\nIn theory, increasing the number of coins in circulation and making large individual sales puts a downward pressure on price, increasing supply without any change in demand. As the Trump organizations enrich themselves through the sale of tokens, other investors—at least some of whom are presumably die-hard Trump supporters—may therefore suffer a fall in the value of their coins.\nIn this sense, claims Jacob Silverman, coauthor of Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud, the TRUMP coin setup seems to bear some of the hallmarks of a “classic memecoin pump-and-dump”—a maneuver whereby an issuer keeps hold of large amounts of their coin, promotes the project, then cashes in their holdings, devaluing the coin and dealing huge losses to other investors.“When you have an insider distribution of 80 percent, the risk that it is going to be dumped on the public or that there will be some kind of major sell-off is just massive. It’s a huge red flag,” alleges Silverman. “Unfortunately, some poor saps are going to get soaked.” (Pump-and-dumps occupy something of a legal gray area, legal experts say, but are roundly condemned as ethically dubious.)\nMelania Trump’s decision to release her own memecoin appears to have already dealt a blow to TRUMP investors, even absent any alleged potential pump-and-dump. After the MELANIA coin went live, the TRUMP token fell in price by 50 percent.\nThe litany of unofficial Trump-inspired memecoins—among them MAGA, MAGA Hat, Doland Tremp and Super Trump—have tumbled in value too. During the 2024 election cycle, political memecoins were used as a proxy for betting on the outcome of the election and expressing support for a particular candidate, rising and falling with events on the campaign trail. But the launch of TRUMP has inadvertently decimated inventors who bought unofficial coins as a mark of their support for Trump.\n“I do not think this is appropriate for the president of the United States,” says Steven Steele, marketing director for the MAGA token, in a video posted to X. “This just seems like an egregious money grab.”\nPerhaps more dangerous than financial losses brought upon supporters, the Trump memecoin could also act as a new vector for bribery, claims Silverman. By investing large sums into a cryptocurrency in which Trump has a large financial interest, thereby driving up its price, politically motivated actors could curry favor with the president without any sort of direct transaction taking place, he alleges. “These are kinds of channels for influence and leverage of a kind we haven’t really seen before,” claims Silverman.\nThe release of an official Trump memecoin marks the latest development in the president’s ongoing flirtation with crypto. Though in his first term Trump rejected bitcoin as a “scam,” he performed a complete volte-face in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election. As crypto industry figureheads endorsed his presidency and threw hundreds of millions of dollars in donations at pro-crypto super PACs, Trump began to pitch himself as the “crypto president.”\nIn July, speaking to thousands of bitcoiners at a conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump promised to turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet” and establish a national “bitcoin stockpile” if reelected. Then in September, the Trump family helped to launch a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, which they pitched as a way to “make finance great again.” (It remains unclear what services World Liberty Financial will provide.)\nWorld Liberty Financial was met with skepticism by some members of the crypto industry, who worried that the project could lead to losses among investors and deal lasting reputational damage should it fail. The same logic applies to the TRUMP memecoin. “If this totally blows up in a lot of people’s faces, it will be super bad, because the media attention will be negative,” says Bendiksen.\nYet for all the potential consequences, there is little to prevent Trump from testing the boundaries of what is acceptable with crypto, says Silverman, as others have done before him. Particularly as he prepares to overhaul the SEC, the financial regulator that most energetically pursued the crypto industry under the previous administration.\n“In some ways, he’s just another crypto entrepreneur,” says Silverman. “He just happens to be the president.”",

    "content_text": "As President Donald Trump was sworn into office as the 47th President of the United States on Monday, grifters and opportunists were already seeking to cash in on the new Trump era—including the president himself.\nJust days before he took office, Trump launched a memecoin called $TRUMP to “celebrate our win and have fun,\" warning that it was “not intended to be … an investment opportunity.” Trump announced the launch on X and Truth Social, with many wondering if the president’s accounts had been hacked.\nHowever, within hours, thousands had invested in the cryptocurrency. The sale was so successful that, at billions of dollars, it accounted for almost 90 percent of Trump’s overall wealth. However, like a lot of memecoins, the $TRUMP coin’s price fluctuated wildly and dipped significantly on Sunday, with the price drop continuing into Monday.\nAt the time he was sworn in as president on Monday, the $TRUMP memecoin was worth just shy of $50 billion, with Trump retaining 80 percent of the coins. The coin, which is built on the Solana blockchain, allows anyone anywhere in the world to funnel money directly to the US president.\nFirst Lady Melania Trump also launched her own memecoin on Sunday, and while it hasn’t reached the level of Trump’s memecoin, the $MELANIA coin was worth almost $8 billion on Monday.\nThe president and first lady were far from the only ones seeking to cash in on the buzz around Trump’s second term, and the inauguration weekend in particular. Since his first term in office, Trump has been a magnet for all types of grifts and cash grabs, many of them endorsed by the president himself, and including everything from guitars and shoes to trading cards and coins.\nReligion has also been on the table. Lee Greenwood, a country singer, said on Sunday that Trump could use a special edition of the “God Bless The USA” bible for his swearing in—the same bible the singer has been selling with Trump since last March.\nThe “Inauguration Day Edition Bible” has been on sale on Greenwood’s own website—alongside hot-pink and camo versions of the bible—for $70 for the last week, but as Trump took office on Monday, the bible appeared to have already sold out.\nA raft of other commemorative items are on sale, ranging from dozens of “Inauguration Day” T-shirts and hats being sold on platforms like Amazon and Etsy to a special “Inauguration Edition” roast from Victory Coffee. A Texas-based jeweler is even offering to gift the president an 8-carat diamond in the shape of his head in what appears to be a marketing bid.\nAnd because Trump’s inauguration was moved indoors due to severe cold weather, tens of thousands of people who had been sent tickets to attend the event were unable to use them. People have attempted to cash in on those tickets, with dozens of listings on eBay offering the unused tickets for up to $200 each. The tickets were distributed free by members of the House of Representatives and feature a hologram and the signature of the representative whose office issued them. Many of the listings have already been sold, with some sellers offering multiple tickets.\nA specific website offering commemorative inaugural tickets was also set up, with some tickets offered for as much as $900. It is unclear who is behind the page, but the site is ranked as the second result on a Google search for \"commemorative inauguration tickets.”\nGrifting and cash grabs in Trumpworld are nothing new. Ever since Trump came to office in 2016, he and his sycophantic supporters have embraced a wide variety of schemes.

The sale was so successful <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/19/donald-trump-crypto-billionaire\">that, at billions of dollars, it accounted for almost 90</a> percent of Trump’s overall wealth. However, like a lot of memecoins, the $TRUMP coin’s price fluctuated wildly and dipped significantly on Sunday, with the price drop continuing into Monday.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">At the time he was sworn in as president on Monday, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://solscan.io/token/6p6xgHyF7AeE6TZkSmFsko444wqoP15icUSqi2jfGiPN\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://solscan.io/token/6p6xgHyF7AeE6TZkSmFsko444wqoP15icUSqi2jfGiPN\" href=\"https://solscan.io/token/6p6xgHyF7AeE6TZkSmFsko444wqoP15icUSqi2jfGiPN\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the $TRUMP memecoin was worth</a> just shy of $50 billion, with Trump retaining 80 percent of the coins. The coin, which is built on the Solana blockchain, allows anyone anywhere in the world to funnel money directly to the US president.</p><p class=\"paywall\">First Lady Melania Trump also launched her own memecoin on Sunday, and while it hasn’t reached the level of Trump’s memecoin, the <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://solscan.io/token/FUAfBo2jgks6gB4Z4LfZkqSZgzNucisEHqnNebaRxM1P\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://solscan.io/token/FUAfBo2jgks6gB4Z4LfZkqSZgzNucisEHqnNebaRxM1P\" href=\"https://solscan.io/token/FUAfBo2jgks6gB4Z4LfZkqSZgzNucisEHqnNebaRxM1P\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$MELANIA coin</a> was worth almost $8 billion on Monday.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The president and first lady were far from the only ones seeking to cash in on the buzz around Trump’s second term, and the inauguration weekend in particular. Since his first term in office, Trump has been a magnet for all types of grifts and cash grabs, many of them endorsed by the president himself, and including everything from guitars and shoes to trading cards and coins.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Religion has also been on the table. Lee Greenwood, a country singer, said on Sunday that Trump could use a special edition of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-god-bless-usa-bible-greenwood-2713fda3efdfa297d0f024efb1ca3003\">“God Bless The USA” bible</a> for his swearing in—the same bible the singer has been selling with Trump since last March.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The “Inauguration Day Edition Bible” has been on sale on Greenwood’s own website—alongside hot-pink and camo versions of the bible—for $70 for the last week, but as Trump took office on Monday, the bible appeared to have already sold out.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A raft of other commemorative items are on sale, ranging from dozens of “Inauguration Day” T-shirts and hats being sold on platforms like Amazon and Etsy to a special “Inauguration Edition” roast from Victory Coffee. A Texas-based jeweler is even offering to gift the president an 8-carat diamond in the shape of his head in what appears to be a marketing bid.</p><p class=\"paywall\">And because Trump’s inauguration was moved indoors due to severe cold weather, tens of thousands of people who had been sent tickets to attend the event were unable to use them. People have attempted to cash in on those tickets, with dozens of listings on eBay offering the unused tickets for up to $200 each. The tickets were distributed free by members of the House of Representatives and feature a hologram and the signature of the representative whose office issued them. Many of the listings have already been sold, with some sellers offering multiple tickets.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A specific website offering commemorative inaugural tickets was also set up, with some tickets offered for as much as $900. It is unclear who is behind the page, but the site is ranked as the second result on a Google search for \"commemorative inauguration tickets.”</p><p class=\"paywall\"><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/impersonators-take-advantage-as-the-trumps-dawdle-over-crypto-reveal/\">Grifting</a> and cash grabs in Trumpworld are nothing new. Ever since Trump came to office in 2016, he and his sycophantic supporters have embraced a wide variety of schemes. With Trump support, many figures have made entire careers grifting on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/election-fraud-conspiracies-flooding-social-media/\">topics like stolen elections</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-strange-twisted-tale/\">Covid denialism</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>",

The Chinese lifestyle and travel app, which has over 300 million mostly monthly active users, surged to the top of US app store charts last week as the TikTok ban approached.\nIn a campaign brief obtained by WIRED, Solare Global, a marketing agency based in New York City, pitched creators on making sponsored posts for RedNote featuring videos of themselves telling their followers about the Chinese app’s sudden rise in the US. The brief asked creators to describe “how fun and engaging the app is” and “emphasize its user-friendly design and international appeal.” It also instructed them to share their own RedNote accounts and encourage their followers to join them on the platform.\nXiaohongshu did not return a request for comment sent to its official WeChat account. Solare Global also did not respond to a request for comment asking how many influencers they contacted or how much the company expected to pay per post.\nThe brief viewed by WIRED required creators to turn their videos around on a 24-hour timeline to ensure they went up by January 17, the same day the Supreme Court was going to decide whether the TikTok ban would go into effect two days later. It also stipulated that influencers must leave their videos up for a minimum of six months.\nXiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and has long mostly focused on courting domestic audiences in China, particularly young women who live in major cities. Like TikTok, it revolves around a central algorithm that recommends users an endless stream of posts based on their interests and behavior. But instead of showing people one video at a time, Xiaohongshu presents photo slideshows, text posts, and videos in a grid format.\nBut perhaps the biggest difference between the two apps is how they handle content moderation. Because it's accessible in China, Xiaohongshu is required to adhere to strict censorship rules dictated by Beijing. (WIRED previously reported that Xiaohongshu was scrambling to hire English-speaking moderators to help manage the flood of content being posted by Americans.) TikTok, on the other hand, isn’t available in China. Its parent company, ByteDance, operates a separate video app there called Douyin.\nThe influx of Americans on Xiaohongshu provided a rare opportunity for people in the US and China to connect on a shared social media platform.

It now appears that Xiaohongshu is trying to capitalize on those sentiments to promote itself as a positive, global platform.\n“The warmth of normal people being kind and curious about one another is the core sentiment there at the moment,” the influencer brief said. “And we think it’s a beautiful thing.”",

It’s caused by skin-on-skin aggression or an item of clothing such as a pack, your running underwear or those old cotton socks rubbing away the top layer of your skin. Running creates a perfect recipe for chafing: friction, moisture and heat which all combined nastily with repetitive motion.\nWhere am I most likely to chafe?\nNipples: Stand at any marathon finish line and we guarantee you’ll see at least one runner crossing the line with big red blood patches radiating out in ripples on their technical t-shirt. Those runners have neglected their nipples and paid the price.\nThighs: Thighs tend to chafe more when skin is exposed but it can happen if your thighs touch while wearing loose-fitting or wet clothing, particularly cotton and non-sweat wicking fabric.\nUndercarriage: We’re politely referring here to the bits between your legs and the area extending up to and including your bottom. Whatever you’ve got down there, it’s at risk of serious rub and excruciating shower-sting.\nUnder arms: With all those sweat glands, armpits are highly prone to chafing. Even if you’ve applied the strongest antiperspirant, chances are, most of us will still sweat. When your arms start swinging, there’s a lot of damp skin-on-skin action.\nShoulders: Mainly one to worry about if you’re running with a backpack or hydration vest over longer distances or for longer hours, but this can be very painful.\nTips to prevent chafing\nWhy should you trust me on chafing? Well, I once ran the equivalent of 67 marathons in 67 days with a 25-pound backpack on. This is my toolkit for anyone trying to avoid pain.\nLube up: Anti-chafing products like petroleum jelly or specialized balms are your best anti-chafe defense. Even if your carefully selected fabrics let you down, generous coatings of lube can save the day. You can’t afford to be shy. Particularly downstairs. You want to make sure you’re getting into the places even you rarely go.\nGo seamless: I choose shorts, leggings, base layer shorts, tees and running underwear that are either seamless or have flat–lock seams. I always check the seams of the built-in twin shorts and I rarely trust the inner-briefs built into regular shorts. If in doubt, layer up with your own trusted undies.\nTighten up: I choose tighter, body hugging layers over loose fit gear. It sounds counterintuitive but fabric that stays in one place, close to the skin works better than loose-hanging fabrics that move around more.\nAvoid cotton: Cotton is heavy and can be abrasive even when it’s dry. When it gets wet with salty sweat, it’s a disaster for your soft bits. Those layers that touch your skin should be made from synthetic or wool-based fabrics. These dry faster and reduce friction.\nPowder your toes: Blisters are essentially chafing gone nuclear and they can be harder to avoid. Powdering my feet and socks can help reduce the moisture that increases the risk of rubbing and hotspots.",

    "content_text": "The night before president-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, right-wing influencers celebrated with cocktails, dancing, and McDonald’s cheeseburgers passed around on platters. They carried ring lights, posed with cardboard cutouts of Elon Musk wearing cowboy hats, and partied with Waka Flocka.\nThe event was sponsored by TikTok and called the Power 30 awards, to celebrate the right’s online cultural takeover. It took place at the Sax, a club decked out with plush velvet walls and garish gold decor located only a few blocks away from the White House.\nIn 2024, Trump and the Republicans won the election with TikTok collabs and podcast interviews. At this party and others across Washington, D,C on Sunday night, dozens of podcasters, influencers, and Republican digital strategists took their victory lap, boozing with their online mutuals and handing out awards for their accomplishments.\n“I wanted to recognize the people who paved the way for the president's return to the White House,” says CJ Pearson, cochair of the RNC’s youth advisory council and a host of Sunday’s event. “We won the influencer election in 2024. We won one of the most important battles, one of the longest-standing culture wars of our time.”\nThis party was for celebrating their victory—and preparing to continue their work under the incoming Trump administration.\nCreators and influencers were all over the 2024 election. They were at the Republican and Democratic conventions and the presidential and vice presidential debates. They streamed from fundraisers and rallies, and appeared on every social media app. They took to the airwaves too—content creators turned podcasters spent countless hours promoting candidates.\nWhile Democrats spent years building out their cohort of influencers, hosting them at campaign events and even President Joe Biden’s White House, the GOP did it better. Despite the Trump campaign’s steep fundraising disadvantages, it partnered with popular podcasters like the comedian Theo Von and Joe Rogan. The interviews were cost-effective and reached massive audiences, in the millions, within hours of their publication. Trump collaborated with OG vloggers turned professional fighters Jake and Logan Paul, along with Kick streamer Adin Ross and other creators, catering to the “manosphere.” During the presidential debates, similar faces—and others—stowed away in conference rooms that turned into makeshift influencer “war rooms.”\nFor years, conservative political influencers picked fights with platforms that would, they claimed, “unjustly” ban or fact-check them. But recently, with Elon Musk’s control of X and Mark Zuckerberg’s removal of fact-checking and many hate speech protections from Meta’s platforms, times have changed. These creators and influencers aren’t working on the fringes anymore, but have found a home right back on these platforms and in the mainstream.\nThroughout the inauguration weekend, Silicon Valley tech companies hosted a variety of creator-focused parties celebrating Trump’s White House takeover. Spotify held a special brunch for podcasters, including the Daily Wire’s Ben Shapiro. Google and YouTube are hosting their own reception for creators and podcasters, a source familiar told WIRED.\nAt the Power 30 party sponsored by TikTok, conservative content creators leaned into their newfound patrons, dancing to top 40 hits for hours in Make America Great Again hats with TikTok-labeled ear muffs stretched over them. At another TikTok-sponsored party at the Capital One Arena Saturday night, conservative creators received company merch, like a koozie with a graphic of Trump dancing or ear muffs in the company’s highlighter pink and blue colors. (Behind the scenes, TikTok appeared to be in turmoil. The app had gone offline Saturday night ahead of the presumptive ban, but returned Sunday and pushed a notification assuring its users that Trump would save the app once he took office.)\n“One of the best parts about my job is actually getting to spend time with our YouTube Creators, because they really do set the culture,” Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube, said in a statement following the company’s Sunday creator event. “They are experimenting with new ideas in the media landscape, and it was amazing to have a front row seat this past year.”\nAt Sunday’s influencer awards party, Trump campaign adviser Alex Bruesewitz, an architect of this winning influencer and online-focused strategy, received an award honoring his digital contributions. Years before joining Trump’s team, Bruesewitz ran X Strategies, a political media agency, working with young, online political candidates like Matt Gaetz. In 2022, he published Winning the Social Media War: How Conservatives Can Fight Back, Reclaim the Narrative, and Turn the Tides Against the Left, a book instructing Republicans on how to use social media for electoral gains.\n“Social media has created an entirely new battlefront for us,” Bruesewitz wrote in 2022. “We have to fight back, we will make them listen, and we will reopen the marketplace.”\nBruesewitz saw the potential podcasts had to bring Trump’s message to voters who weren’t already hearing it. The podcasts played a major role in Trump’s election, providing him with massive audiences of what Bruesewitz described as “medium- and low-propensity male voters” in an interview with WIRED after the election. It was these voters, who Bruesewitz said don’t usually consume mainstream media, that secured the win.\nOthers agreed: Shapiro told WIRED on Sunday that podcasts “gave a window into the authenticity of the candidates.”\nAnd according to Pearson, this year’s conservative influencer takeover is just the beginning.\nOver the summer, Pearson hosted an event with the Heritage Foundation to train more than two dozen conservative creators on how to communicate their politics with voters online. Savannah Chrisley, Sean Mike Kelly, and Emily Saves America, some of whom came out of the Turning Point USA ambassador program, attended the event.\nSince 2019, Turning Point has recruited and trained at least 400 conservative influencers in what is essentially an incubator. Some of the most popular influencers on the right have come out of Turning Point’s program, including Alex Clark, Benny Johnson, and Candace Owens. The training typically takes place at summits held around the country where Turning Point leadership, like Charlie Kirk and Tyler Bowyer, teach attendees how to post. Once an influencer is onboarded onto Turning Point’s influencer program, the organization’s public relations team actively pitches them to producers on networks like Fox News. They’re invited to special events where speakers (including Trump and Tucker Carlson) give speeches and allow for creators to network and collaborate to grow their audiences.\n“TPUSA has partnered with hundreds of dynamic personalities and content creators, from in-house contributors crafting content five days a week to influencers seamlessly integrating the message of freedom into their online presence and attending our premier events,” the organization’s website says.\n“We instituted our influencer program right after Trump got elected the first time,” Tyler Bowyer, the chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, told WIRED on Sunday. “The left has gotten lazy, depending on Hollywood for influence, while we've had homegrown influencers that come right here from Turning Point. The amount of reach we've received is in the billions, with people that people actually listen to while the left has relied on Hollywood.”\nGOP operatives are already planning new influencer training events to take place. “In the coming months we’ll be recruiting up-and-coming influencers, molding them, investing in them, and helping them grow their platforms,” says Pearson. “And this event also is a little bit of a kickoff to that, so we're super excited about it.”\nThe Biden White House invited influencers to events and special briefings, but the incoming Trump administration seems eager to incorporate them into its everyday media apparatus. At Pete Hegseth’s confirmation hearing for defense secretary, there were at least two conservative creators in the room. Graham Allen and Rob Smith, a pair of veterans and Turning Point USA influencers, sat in on the hearing, shooting video clips and writing tweets supporting Trump’s nominee and combating any criticism he received in real time online.\nWhen asked if the influencers were requested by the Trump team to attend and create content at Hegseth’s confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Trump adviser Jason Miller told WIRED, “Hegseth has many friends, former military colleagues, Gold Star families, and more who back his nomination, dozens of which are here to support him today!”\nOn Monday, a handful of the creators who bolstered Trump’s campaign online will attend the incoming president’s inaugural events. These moments will not only symbolize a new political era in the US, but a cultural one: one where people like Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, Von, and the Paul brothers have the ear of the president.\n\"We've won a really important battle in the culture war, but it's certainly not over. The war continues,” Matt Walsh, a conservative political commentator for the Daily Wire, told WIRED on Saturday.",

The podcasts played a major role in Trump’s election, providing him with massive audiences of what Bruesewitz described as “medium- and low-propensity male voters” <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-online-campaign-era/\">in an interview with WIRED after the election</a>. It was these voters, who Bruesewitz said don’t usually consume mainstream media, that secured the win.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Others agreed: Shapiro told WIRED on Sunday that podcasts “gave a window into the authenticity of the candidates.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">And according to Pearson, this year’s conservative influencer takeover is just the beginning.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Over the summer, Pearson hosted an event with the Heritage Foundation to train more than two dozen conservative creators on how to communicate their politics with voters online. Savannah Chrisley, Sean Mike Kelly, and Emily Saves America, some of whom came out of the Turning Point USA ambassador program, attended the event.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Since 2019, Turning Point has recruited and trained <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868483/turning-point-charlie-kirk-republican-influencers-instagram-today-is-america\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868483/turning-point-charlie-kirk-republican-influencers-instagram-today-is-america\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868483/turning-point-charlie-kirk-republican-influencers-instagram-today-is-america\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">at least 400 conservative influencers</a> in what is essentially an incubator. Some of the most popular influencers on the right have come out of Turning Point’s program, including Alex Clark, Benny Johnson, and Candace Owens. The training typically takes place at summits held around the country where Turning Point leadership, like Charlie Kirk and Tyler Bowyer, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=779385522495806\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=779385522495806\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=779385522495806\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">teach attendees how to post</a>.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nWhen you decide it's time to give your kids access to your devices—or maybe even a phone or tablet of their own—you'll want to make sure they stay safe. There are dangers and risks out there in the digital world, just as there are in the physical one.\nGoogle, Apple, and Microsoft know this, and have built parental controls right into their various apps and platforms. These controls work by linking your account to the accounts of your kids, so you can put up the limits and safeguards you think are appropriate.\nGoogle's tools for managing your family and keeping your kids safe can be set up and accessed via the Your family on Google page on the web. From here you can connect to up to five other family members, and create Google accounts for any youngsters who are under 13.\nThat links your account with others and pools any Google One cloud storage you might have paid for. The next step is to download the Google Family Link app for Android or iOS—this is where you can monitor how your children are using their devices, and put limits on that usage if needed.\nThese features and controls only work if your kids are using Android devices or Chromebook laptops (though you can view and edit your settings from an iPhone or iPad). Neither Apple nor Google allow access to each other's parental control services, so you really need a family using the same operating systems.\nThe Google Family Link app can show you where in the world your family members are. Tap the menu button (three lines, top left), pick a name, then choose Location—this is handy for anything from making sure your youngsters are home from school to figuring out where you need to pick them up from.\nThen there's the parental controls section inside the app. Tap on the child account you want to manage, then Controls and Daily limit to set how much time your kid can spend on their devices overall. As well as a daily limit, you're also able to set a cut-off point via the Bedtime option, after which your youngster will find themselves locked out of their phones, tablets, and laptops until morning.\nDig into the Content restrictions section under Controls for each of your kids and you can block or allow specific apps to be run. (You'll also be able to approve new app downloads before they're installed, though app updates can be applied without your permission.) You can't limit time on specific apps, but you can see which apps your kids are using the most.\nFinally, via the Highlights tab inside the app you can manage the Android and ChromeOS devices your child has access to, and see what they're doing on those devices (in terms of the apps they're using and installing, for example). You can also manage the same set of options through the Your family on Google page on the web.\nApple\nApple's single stop for family account management is Family Sharing. Besides yourself, you can add up to five other people, kids or otherwise, and then share everything from Apple Music to purchased apps to iCloud storage. Children age 13 and over can have their own Apple ID. For younger children, you can create and manage an Apple ID for them.\nTo get started with Family Sharing, open Settings on an iPhone or iPad, tap your Apple account name at the top, then choose Family and Continue. If you're on a Mac, open up System Settings from the Apple menu, then click your name and Family > Set Up Family. Follow the instructions to invite people to your family or set up the necessary Apple accounts for your youngsters.\nWith your family created, services such as Apple TV Plus, Apple Music, Apple News Plus, and Apple Arcade are shared automatically if you're subscribed to them. Any iCloud storage you've purchased is pooled between family members, and Photos automatically creates a shared album for everyone to use. Most of this happens without any effort on your part—when people in your family sign into their Apple account, they'll see the same apps and services available as you do.\nIn terms of looking after your children, there are a few key tools bundled with Family Sharing. You can look up their locations on a map at any time—to do this, open up the Find My app on iOS or macOS and select the people you want to share your location with. You can also make sure that app, movie, music, and any other purchases your kids try to make go through you first. After selecting your Apple account in Settings on iOS or System Settings on macOS, choose Family then Purchase Sharing to set this up.\nYou can use the same Screen Time feature that tracks your own device usage to monitor what your kids are up to—and put limits in place if needed. Open up Screen Time from Settings on iOS or System Settings on macOS, and as long as you have a family sharing plan in place, you'll be able to select each of your children and see what they're up to, and put restrictions in place if needed.\nThere are six key categories to work through, though they're laid out slightly differently on mobile and on desktop: Downtime for controlling overall time on a device, App Limits for limiting time in specific apps, Communication Limits for controlling who your kids can chat with, Communication Safety for auto-detecting explicit content, Always Allowed for approving key apps for unlimited use, and Content & Privacy Restrictions for putting limits on accessing mature content—both in terms of videos and the web.\nYou can, for example, make sure only key apps like the Phone app are available after a certain time at night. Screen time works across Apple computers and mobile devices, so the settings are carried across, and of course you can adapt these settings at any time as your children get older.\nMicrosoft\nThe Microsoft account you use to sign in to Windows can form the basis of a family group that also allows you to keep tabs on your kids. These features work across Windows, Android, and Xbox, and to a limited extent on iOS (again, Apple doesn't really allow other software the necessary access to apps for phone monitoring).\nIn this case, there's a bit of a muddle of old and new tools. The best place to get started is the Microsoft Family Safety website. From there you'll be able to specify the people in your family (families can have up to six people in them, including you), and access the Microsoft Family Safety app on the web, Android, and iOS.\nAll the regular features for your family can be accessed through the apps on web and mobile. Pick one of your kids and you can see where they are on a map (based on the location of their Android device), see how much time they're spending on their devices, and put limits on screen time, app use, and web access.\nAs with Google and Apple, children aged 13 and over can have their own Microsoft accounts, and you can create accounts for kids that are younger than that. Apps and games on Windows and Xbox can be filtered by age appropriateness, while web and search limits can be set through the Microsoft Edge browser. Apps can be blocked on Windows, Xbox, or Android.\nTap the gear icon (top right) on any child profile on mobile to turn features like activity reporting, web filters, and app limits on or off. It gives you the flexibility you need to adjust these restrictions as your kids get older, and location sharing can also be toggled on or off from the same settings screen.\nChoose Screen time from the child profile to set how long they're allowed to spend on each device, and between which times. You can set app time limits on Windows, Xbox and Android, and overall screen time limits on Windows and Xbox. There are also tools on Windows and Xbox to keep children from buying new content or tons of in-app purchases. As long as your children are signing into their devices with their Microsoft accounts, the rules you've set will be applied.",

Every year brings new emoji—I like the “face with bags under eyes,” though that one is still rolling out. But there are times when the preinstalled options just aren't specific enough. Thankfully, Apple has a solution, and it's called Genmoji.\nWith the help of Apple Intelligence, you can generate custom emojis right from your keyboard using text prompts or even a person's photo from your Photos library. Below, I break down all the steps for creating your own Genmoji.\nCheck out our iOS 18 roundup for a full list of all the top features of Apple's latest operating system. Be sure to also look at our other Apple guides, including the Best iPhones, Best iPhone 16 Accessories, and Best iPads.\nEnable Apple Intelligence\nBefore we start, you'll want to check if you have access to Apple Intelligence. It launched with iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1, but Genmoji specifically launched in iOS 18.2. To check your software version, go to Settings > General > About. You're good to go if it says iOS 18.2 or newer. If you need to update, back up your device first.\nIf you still don't have access to Genmoji, make sure that Apple Intelligence is enabled (it should be by default). Go to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri and toggle on Apple Intelligence. It's worth noting that Apple Intelligence is only available on select iPhones—the iPhone 16 range, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nEnter Your Prompt\n- When you have a Messages window open, tap on the emoji icon (the smiley face) or keyboard icon (the globe) to access the emoji keyboard.\n- In the upper right-hand corner of the keyboard, tap on the Genmoji icon (the pink and blue smiley face with a plus sign).\n- Type a few words or a phrase into the textbox that describes what you're looking for and tap Done.\n- Swipe through the populated Genmojis and tap Add on the one you want to use. It'll then appear in your drawer of emojis and stickers.\n- You can also create Genmojis based on images of people in your Photos app. Start by typing in a prompt like “Julian celebrating his birthday,” tap “Choose a Person” from the list of contacts that appear, and select the specific person. From there, you'll see various Genmojis populate based on the prompt. Tap Add when you've found the one you want to use.\nFine-Tune Your Genmoji\nYou can also tweak your original prompt to create new versions of your original Genmoji.\n- In the Genmoji window, tap on the text box.\n- Type in a refined version of your prompt or an entirely new version. For example, instead of “dog in a birthday hat,” you can change it to “dog with a birthday cake.” It will then automatically repopulate new versions.\nDelete a Genmoji\nYou can delete a Genmoji from your library if you no longer want it or want to create an updated version.\n- Open the emoji drawer on the Messages app and tap the emoji or keyboard icon.\n- Find the Genmoji you want to delete.\n- Long-press and tap Delete.\n- If you want to move it around your library, tap Rearrange and drag it wherever.\nJust remember, Genmoji is still in beta, so it may not always work smoothly and may make errors.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nI’ve tested basically every meal kit on the market over the past few years. And while there’s no denying the absolute convenience they offer, there are also a few tips and tricks I’ve learned to make the experience even smoother—namely, the gadgets and gizmos I reach for every single time a new box arrives at my door, full of ingredients to cook. From my favorite pan to the best oil to have around, consider these essentials if you’re cooking more at home. Of course, you probably already have a cutting board and a pan.

Subscribe Today.\nIs There Anything Else I Should Have on Hand?\nI go through a lot of paper towels when I’m making meal kits. I also highly recommend having a Rachael Ray–inspired “garbage bowl” on the counter for things like random plastic bits and aforementioned paper towels. (And a separate one for veggie scraps, if you compost.) Another thing worth noting is that you will likely use a lot of dishes when cooking meal kits. Start with your dishes done and your dishwasher empty for the best experience. And finally, I like to have a pair of scissors around for cutting open sauce packets or snipping green onions. I don’t think you really need specialty kitchen shears, but if you’ve got some, they’ll come in handy. Otherwise just grab whatever (clean!) pair you’ve got on hand.\nHow We Tested\nI’ve used every single item in this guide while cooking dozens, if not hundreds, of dishes, both for work and in my personal life. I’ve washed them, I’ve stored them, I’ve chopped on them, and I’ve recommended them to my friends. (Congrats, reader—we’re friends now.)",

    "content_text": "Less than 24 hours after going dark, TikTok says it has come back online after President-elect Donald Trump gave the company's service providers—presumably Apple, Google, and Oracle—reassurance that his administration wouldn’t enforce a law banning the app in the first place.\n\"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service,” the company wrote in a statement. “We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It’s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"\nIt’s the latest salvo in the dramatic fight over TikTok’s future in the US. Last year, Congress passed a law that required ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, to divest its US operations or face a ban starting January 19. TikTok sued on First Amendment grounds but lost at the Supreme Court. Last night, Apple and Google took the app out of their respective app stores, as well as many other apps developed by ByteDance. Oracle reportedly told employees to shut down servers that hosted TikTok US data, according to The Information.\nThe move set the stage for President-elect Trump, who’d tried to ban TikTok when he was in office, to save the app before he is sworn in as President. “I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security,” he wrote on Truth Social Sunday morning. “The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.”\nTechnically, the law only allows Trump to extend the enforcement deadline if ByteDance makes real progress on a deal to divest its US operations. Among those whose names have been mentioned as possible acquirers: Elon Musk and fellow billionaire Frank McCourt. While McCourt made an official bid, Musk’s name was reportedly floated in discussions with the Chinese government, according to Bloomberg. “I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up. Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.”\nTikTok, in addition to other ByteDance-owned apps, is still not back in US app stores as of publication. But several users have reported being able to access their timelines again after they were listed as unavailable last night. Others had regained access to their accounts, but with varying degrees of functionality.\nAfter the Supreme Court decision, the Biden administration appeared to walk back its commitment to the ban, saying that it was leaving enforcement up to the Trump administration. That reassurance was not enough for TikTok, which voluntarily took itself offline ahead of the deadline.\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appealed directly to Trump in a TikTok where he thanked the incoming president for his commitment to working with the company “to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.” On Blind, an anonymous messaging app that requires users to verify their employment before viewing company-specific posts, users mocked the video. “CEO begging Trump to save TT,” one wrote. “This is so cringe,” another responded.\nWhile many in Washington appeared to quietly stop supporting the ban, which had declined in popularity among US adults in recent months, others applauded the decision and voiced outrage when TikTok announced it was coming back online. “Any company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs. Think about it,” wrote Sen. Tom Cotton on X.",

    "content_text": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nA new proof has brought mathematicians one step closer to understanding the hidden order of those “atoms of arithmetic,” the prime numbers.\nThe primes—numbers that are only divisible by themselves and 1—are the most fundamental building blocks in math. They’re also the most mysterious. At first glance, they seem to be scattered at random across the number line. But of course, the primes aren’t random. They’re completely determined, and a closer look at them reveals all sorts of strange patterns, which mathematicians have spent centuries trying to unravel. A better understanding of how the primes are distributed would illuminate vast swaths of the mathematical universe.\nBut while mathematicians have formulas that give an approximate sense of where the primes are located, they can’t pinpoint them exactly. Instead, they’ve had to take a more indirect approach.\nAround 300 BCE, Euclid proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Mathematicians have since built on his theorem, proving the same statement for primes that meet additional criteria. (A simple example: Are there an infinite number of primes that don’t contain the number 7?) Over time, mathematicians have made these criteria stricter and stricter. By showing that there are still infinitely many primes that satisfy such increasingly rigid constraints, they’ve been able to learn more about where the primes live.\nBut these kinds of statements are very difficult to prove. “There are not many results like that out there,” said Joni Teräväinen of the University of Turku in Finland.\nNow, two mathematicians—Ben Green of the University of Oxford and Mehtaab Sawhney of Columbia University—have proved just such a statement for a particularly challenging type of prime number. Their proof, which was posted online in October, doesn’t just sharpen mathematicians’ understanding of the primes. It also makes use of a set of tools from a very different area of mathematics, suggesting that those tools are far more powerful than mathematicians imagined, and potentially ripe for applications elsewhere.\n“It’s terrific,” said John Friedlander of the University of Toronto. “It really surprised me that they did this.”\nA Trying Set\nMathematicians tend to study families of primes that are just complicated enough to be interesting but still simple enough to make progress on. They might try to prove, for instance, that there are infinitely many primes that are 500 units apart. Or that we can build infinitely many primes by adding up the squares of other numbers.\nThis last constraint has been particularly useful, guiding centuries of mathematical progress. In 1640, Pierre de Fermat conjectured that there are infinitely many primes that can be formulated by squaring two whole numbers and adding them together. (The prime number 13, for instance, can be written as 22 + 32.) Leonhard Euler later proved it. But tweaking the question just a little bit—by insisting that one of the numbers you’re squaring be odd, perhaps, or a perfect square—makes the problem much harder. “The more you constrain a set, the harder it is to find primes in it,” Green said.\nIn the 19th century, research on these kinds of statements led to the development of much of modern number theory. In the 20th century, it helped inspire one of the most ambitious mathematical efforts to date, the Langlands program. And in the 21st, work on these sorts of primes has continued to yield new techniques and insights.\nIn 2018, Friedlander and Henryk Iwaniec of Rutgers University asked if there are infinitely many primes of the form p2 + 4q2, where both p and q must also be prime. (For example, 41 = 52 + 4 × 22.) The constraint turned out to be particularly challenging to deal with. But if mathematicians could solve the problem, they’d succeed in exerting a new level of control over the primes—exactly what they’d hoped to do all along.\nA Fruitful Visit\nNeither Green nor Sawhney had played this type of prime-counting game before. But they both had experience in studying the strange patterns the primes give rise to.\nIn July, the two mathematicians met at a conference in Edinburgh. Sawhney, who had just finished graduate school, had always admired Green. A seminal result Green had proved 20 years earlier was “one of the things that brought me into the subject,” Sawhney said. “I was like, ‘Oh man, how could you do this?’” Green was impressed by the younger mathematician, too. “Mehtaab is an exceptional, exceptional mathematician,” he said. “He knows everything somehow.”\nThe two decided to collaborate. They just had to find the right problem to work on. After some discussion, they settled on Friedlander and Iwaniec’s conjecture.\nGreen invited Sawhney to Oxford for a week. They knew that to prove similar conjectures, mathematicians usually relied on a particular suite of counting techniques. But because the primes in their problem were so strictly defined, Green and Sawhney couldn’t figure out a way to get this traditional tool kit to work.\nInstead, they hoped to prove the conjecture in a more roundabout way—by making a mathematical chess move of sorts. But first, they’d have to prove that they were allowed to make the move in the first place.\nBy the end of Sawhney’s visit, he and Green had figured out how to do that—which allowed them to prove the conjecture. To do so, they ended up making a surprising connection to another area of math.\nTry Another Set\nIt wasn’t possible for Green and Sawhney to directly count the number of primes made by squaring two other primes and adding them together. But what if they loosened their constraint just a bit? They realized they could solve a slightly weaker version of their problem—one where the numbers getting squared only had to be “roughly” prime.\nRough primes are much easier to find than primes. Say you want to count all the rough primes between 1 and 200. First, consider a handful of the smallest primes—like 2, 3, 5, and 7. Then list all the numbers that aren’t divisible by those primes. These numbers are the rough primes. In this case, you end up with 50 rough primes: 46 of them are actually prime, while the remaining four (121, 143, 169 and 187) are not. Because the rough primes are much less randomly distributed than the primes are, they’re significantly easier to work with. “The rough primes are a set that we understand much, much better,” Sawhney said.\nGreen and Sawhney proved that there are infinitely many primes that can be made by squaring two rough primes and adding them together. They now just had to show that this statement would imply the problem they actually wanted to solve: There are also infinitely many primes that can be written as the sum of squares of actual primes.\nBut that wasn’t obvious. They’d have to analyze a special set of functions, called Type I and Type II sums, for each version of their problem, then show that the sums were equivalent no matter which constraint they used. Only then would Green and Sawhney know they could substitute rough primes into their proof without losing information.\nThey soon came to a realization: They could show that the sums were equivalent using a tool that each of them had independently encountered in previous work. The tool, known as a Gowers norm, was developed decades earlier by the mathematician Timothy Gowers to measure how random or structured a function or set of numbers is. On its face, the Gowers norm seemed to belong to a completely different realm of mathematics. “It’s almost impossible to tell as an outsider that these things are related,” Sawhney said.\nBut using a landmark result proved in 2018 by the mathematicians Terence Tao and Tamar Ziegler, Green and Sawhney found a way to make the connection between Gowers norms and Type I and II sums. Essentially, they needed to use Gowers norms to show that their two sets of primes—the set built using rough primes, and the set built using real primes—were sufficiently similar.\nAs it turned out, Sawhney knew how to do this. Earlier this year, in order to solve an unrelated problem, he had developed a technique for comparing sets using Gowers norms. To his surprise, the technique was just good enough to show that the two sets had the same Type I and II sums.\nWith this in hand, Green and Sawhney proved Friedlander and Iwaniec’s conjecture: There are infinitely many primes that can be written as p2 + 4q2. Ultimately, they were able to extend their result to prove that there are infinitely many primes belonging to other kinds of families as well. The result marks a significant breakthrough on a type of problem where progress is usually very rare.\nEven more important, the work demonstrates that the Gowers norm can act as a powerful tool in a new domain. “Because it’s so new, at least in this part of number theory, there is potential to do a bunch of other things with it,” Friedlander said. Mathematicians now hope to broaden the scope of the Gowers norm even further—to try using it to solve other problems in number theory beyond counting primes.\n“It’s a lot of fun for me to see things I thought about some time ago have unexpected new applications,” Ziegler said. “It’s like as a parent, when you set your kid free and they grow up and do mysterious, unexpected things.”\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

Video-editing app CapCut, photo- and video-sharing app Lemon8, and others have now gone dark in the US.\nA federal law passed last year bans ByteDance-owned apps from operating in the US on national security grounds. In reaction to Chinese laws that demand China-based companies provide their data to the Chinese government and intelligence agencies, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) required ByteDance to sell TikTok and its other apps to an entity not based in China by Sunday.\nThat sale did not happen. As a result, TikTok began blocking US-based users on Saturday, January 18, ahead of the midnight deadline. Because PAFACA bans all apps operated by ByteDance, not just TikTok, users of its myriad other apps are meeting the same restrictions.\nPAFACA does not require ByteDance to block US-based users of its apps. Instead, it prohibits any US company from providing any service to “distribute, maintain or update” ByteDance-owned apps. As a result, many of these apps are no longer available in Apple and Google’s app stores. That may change soon after Donald Trump takes office on Monday, however, with the US president-elect indicating that he plans to extend the deadline for a sale of TikTok by 90 days. Yes, it is all very confusing.\nFor now, here’s the rundown of all the apps US users can no longer access due to the US ban on ByteDance-owned apps.\nTikTok, TikTok Studio, TikTok Shop Seller, TikTok Lite\nNot just TikTok, but other ByteDance-owned apps that work for the TikTok ecosystem have also become unavailable along with the main app. These include TikTok Studio (for creators to manage content and check analytics), TikTok Shop Seller (for ecommerce sellers on the app to manage their business operations), and TikTok Lite (a smaller and faster version of the original app that’s only available in certain countries).\nCapCut\nCapCut is a free video-editing tool, optimized for vertical videos that can be posted on TikTok. It is often the app of choice for amateur creators, due to its professional features. Some creators also use CapCut to first produce videos before uploading them to platforms other than TikTok.\nLemon8\nByteDance released Lemon8 in February 2023 as a photo-based social media app. It is known for resembling RedNote, a particularly successful social media app in China that has also become the destination for many TikTok users in exile this week. Some TikTok users had also chosen to migrate to Lemon8, but the app has also gone offline.\nGauth\nWith Gauth, students can take pictures of their homework, and the app will use artificial intelligence to understand the problem and provide step-by-step solutions. It also has other features that help students be more productive while studying. According to the app’s shutdown announcement this weekend, it has “helped 300 million users with billions of questions.”\nMarvel Snap, Land of Empires, Mission EVO\nAlso swept up in the ban on ByteDance-owned apps are several games, including the fast-action card game Marvel Snap. Developed by California-based studio Second Dinner, Marvel Snap is published by Nuverse, which ByteDance owns and launched in 2019. Second Dinner said in a statement posted to X that it did not expect to be part of the collateral damage of the TikTok ban law and vowed to restore access for US users. “Marvel Snap isn’t going anywhere. We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share,” the company said.\nNuverse games Land of Empires and Mission EVO are also no longer available in US app stores.\nHypic\nHypic, launched in 2022, is a photo-editing tool with a heavy focus on generative AI tools. It uses AI to help users enhance photo quality or transform a photo into a cartoon.\nLark\nLark is a Slack-like workspace communications app. Originally created for ByteDance’s own internal messages among employees, it has now become one of the most-used office communications apps in China, with several million active users.\nMelolo, Fizzo, MyTopia Books\nPoligon, a Singapore-based subsidiary of ByteDance, publishes several apps that allow users to watch short vertical dramas (Melolo) or read online fiction novels (Fizzo and MyTopia Books). MyTopia Books is the only one of those apps that did not end support for US-based users, and somehow remains available on Apple’s US App Store.\nTokopedia\nTokopedia is one of Indonesia’s largest ecommerce platforms. It was acquired by ByteDance in December 2023 and merged with TikTok Shop’s operation in the country after the Indonesian government banned the latter app, citing “the need to protect smaller merchants and users’ data.”\nIt has become unavailable on Apple’s US App Store but remains available on Google’s US Play Store as of publication.\nUpdated 9 am EST, January 19, 2025: Added the games Marvel Snap, Land of Empires, and Mission EVO to the list of apps unavailable in the US as a result of the ban on ByteDance-owned properties.",

    "content_text": "After an opaque and uncertain saga, TikTok went dark on millions of phones across the United States on Saturday evening around 10:30 pm EST. Google Play and Apple’s App Store both pulled the app late Saturday as well. If it was already installed prior to Saturday evening, the app is still there on your phone, but launching it only reveals a pop-up warning about the ban. As the deadline loomed, TikTok users had been bracing for the change and flooding other platforms, including the Chinese social app Xiaohongshu or “RedNote.” But if you’re not quite ready to give up the latest skin-care hacks, budgeting tips, and pet tortoise influencers, there are some options for circumventing the ban and continuing to use the platform.\n“Sorry, TikTok isn’t available right now,” the app alert reads. “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!” Other ByteDance-owned apps, including CapCut and Lemon8, also disappeared from US app stores.\nSuch a ban has never existed in the US before, so the technical methods being employed to implement it are still evolving, and circumvention techniques may need to change as well. The law driving the situation, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), doesn’t make it illegal to have TikTok on your phone. And, notably, it also doesn’t say that TikTok itself has to stop the app from working in the US.\nNonetheless, the company said in the days before the law took effect that it planned to make the app inaccessible to US users—a level of cooperation and accommodation that the outgoing Biden White House called a “stunt” on Saturday afternoon. Even if TikTok itself had obligations under the law, the Biden White House had signaled that it did not plan to enforce the ban before Trump took office on Monday.\nRather than putting the pressure on TikTok, PAFACA requires app stores and cloud hosting services to stop doing anything to “distribute, maintain or update” TikTok. That puts the pressure on Apple and Google to stop new users from downloading TikTok, as well as infrastructure providers like Oracle to keep new content or software updates from reaching the app’s users. Over time, TikTok would likely degrade and become unusable.\nOfficials in India banned TikTok in 2020, and the company also proactively blacked out the app in that case. When Indian users who already had the app installed tried to launch it, a pop-up appeared telling them that they couldn’t access the service.\nDevashish Gosain, a network analysis researcher and assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, says that in India, TikTok users must remove their Indian SIM card from their phone or use an international SIM card and then run a VPN in order to load content in the app.\n“Even VPNs do not lead to circumvention” in India, Gosain told WIRED.\nIn the early hours of the US ban, it was unclear exactly how feasible it would be to get around the restrictions for US accounts. It seemed that TikTok had taken a more extreme approach, turning any US builds of the app dark—blacking out versions of the TikTok app software that had been made to be downloaded and used by US users. It also seemed that US-linked accounts were being blocked regardless of IP address or SIM country information.\nRunning a VPN alone was certainly not enough to circumvent the ban and get back on TikTok. But seemingly using a non-US TikTok account after removing a SIM (or on a device without a US SIM card/US phone number) worked when combined with a VPN. Similarly, using a VPN with a desktop browser or the Tor Browser was enough to get a non-US TikTok account to load in the US early on Sunday morning, though TikTok’s desktop version has always been much more limited than its mobile app.\nThe impact of the ban has been immediate, with internet traffic data from monitoring firm Kentik showing an instant and dramatic drop off in connections to TikTok. On other social media platforms, people are complaining that TikTok is not working on their US-linked devices or accounts even though they are abroad.\nTikTok’s privacy policies, which are not unlike those of other social media apps, describe a range of information it collects, which could be used to identify people’s home locations. This includes everything from address information users provide to device system settings, SIM card regions, and other network information. (TikTok’s privacy policy now includes a note saying service to US users may not be available due to the law, calling it an “interruption.”)\nIn a statement posted online, Apple says if US users delete TikTok or move to a new phone, TikTok and other ByteDance apps can’t be reinstalled. It also stated that the software distribution ban will impact people visiting the US. “Users visiting from outside the United States with their Apple Account set to a country or region that is not the United States are unable to download, update, or make in-app purchases and new subscriptions,” Apple says.\n“TikTok inspects the source IP of the network packets—if the source IP belongs to India, it drops the packets,” Gosain explains, of the restrictions in India. “Also, the TikTok app fetches the country information embedded in the SIM card, and if the country code is ‘IN,’ it filters the network connection. When we remove the SIM card, the TikTok app fails to identify Indian users from the SIM card, and when we use VPNs, the IP address changes, and it no longer belongs to the Indian IP range. Thus, TikTok again fails to identify that the user is accessing from India. This is how we bypass the filtering.”\nVirtual private networks, or VPNs, work by passing your internet traffic through servers that are physically maintained in locations around the world, so you can select an IP address that is tied to a different location than where you physically are. For example, American TikTok users can use VPNs to make it look like they are accessing the internet from outside the US. VPNs also stop your internet service provider (ISPs) from seeing your browsing data, adding an extra potential layer of privacy. When you’re using a VPN, your ISP will simply see connections to the VPN instead of having access to the detailed list of all the websites you’re visiting.\nAs a result of these capabilities, VPNs are frequently used in attempts to get around digital geolocation restrictions, like those on Netflix or other streaming platforms. They’re also an important, and familiar, tool for circumventing internet censorship programs for people living under authoritarian regimes like those in Russia, China, and Iran.\nUsing a VPN comes with caveats, though. Some commercial VPNs log people’s browsing history, which essentially just shifts data collection from ISPs to VPN makers. This means that the data isn’t more protected, and that law enforcement could request it from a VPN provider in the same way that they make requests to ISPs. As a result, picking a free VPN is generally not a good idea—with some even selling access to your home internet connections. But some VPNs publish no-logging policies and offer third-party audits and other transparency features in an attempt to show their compliance.\nFor now, it seems that TikTok’s efforts to block US users are extremely draconian, and even a non-US SIM card or no SIM card plus a VPN may not be a workable path to getting back on the app with a US TikTok account. But the restrictions may only be temporary anyway. In practice, there seems to be little appetite for a permanent ban in the US. And, in spite of originating the idea, President Trump has said in recent days that he doesn’t want the app to be banned.\n“My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Friday. “Stay tuned!”\nUpdated 8:42 am EST, January 19, 2025: Added details about traffic analytics to TikTok, the company's privacy policy related to location, and a statement from Apple.",

    "content_text": "For the first time in internet history, the United States government has officially banned a major global social media platform, joining the ranks of authoritarian regimes like Russia and China. On Saturday, TikTok officially went dark. Users who attempt to access the app are now greeted with a message that says “TikTok isn’t available right now.”\n“We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office,” the message adds. “Please stay tuned!”\nIt’s the final outcome of legislation Congress passed last year that requires TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to either sell the app’s American operations or face a nationwide ban. But unlike countries that regularly engage in internet censorship, the US does not have centralized infrastructure to prevent Americans from accessing specific apps or websites.\nInstead, the law puts pressure on Apple and Google to delete TikTok from their app stores, or risk accumulating millions of dollars in fines. Both companies appeared to have removed TikTok and other apps owned by its parent company, ByteDance, as of Saturday. Google and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe law also bans companies from providing data hosting services to TikTok. Oracle, which counts TikTok as one of its largest cloud computing customers, reportedly began telling staff to shut down servers that host US TikTok data on Saturday, according to The Information. Oracle did not immediately return a request for comment.\nIn May, TikTok and a group of US creators appealed to stop the law from going into effect, saying it violated the First Amendment. The Supreme Court rejected those arguments in a unanimous ruling on January 17, concluding that the provision was motivated by “well-supported national security concerns.”\n“It’s a blatant violation of the First Amendment,” says Evelyn Douek, a professor at Stanford Law School who specializes in online speech issues. “Unfortunately for me, all nine of the Supreme Court justices disagree, and pretty much everyone that matters is going to listen to their opinion over mine. It's hard to take the national security justification seriously, though, when in recent days presidents past and future as well as members of Congress seem to be backpedaling on whether an immediate shutdown is necessary after all.”\nWith days to go until the deadline, President Biden signaled that he’d leave enforcement of the law up to the incoming Trump administration. The move left the app’s fate in limbo, and TikTok urged the Biden administration Saturday to provide definitive assurance that it wouldn’t enforce the law. In response, Biden’s team suggested TikTok raise its concerns with Trump.\nOn Blind, an anonymous messaging app popular with tech workers, some TikTok employees spiraled about whether they’d have jobs next month, while others went about business as usual. “Anyone else’s manager still scheduling meetings next week about new, upcoming projects without acknowledging the ban whatsoever?” wrote one user. “I have 2025 strategy meetings next week,” another user responded. “I am just doing what I’m told. It’s comforting in a way.”\nTrump tried to ban TikTok during his first term, but he later changed his stance after amassing a large following on the platform. The incoming president said on Saturday that he “likely” would issue an executive order on Monday giving TikTok a 90-day extension on the ban. “I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at,” he said in an interview with NBC News.\nBut the law itself technically limits Trump's ability to temporarily halt the ban. It permits the president to grant a 90-day extension only if there is evidence that “significant progress” has been made toward a sale, including “binding legal agreements” between the parties.\nA colorful assortment of tech and business figures have said they are interested in acquiring TikTok, including real estate mogul and former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers Frank McCourt. Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence search engine startup, filed a bid to create a new merged entity with TikTok on Saturday, according to CNBC.\nAnother idea that was reportedly discussed among officials in the Chinese government is selling TikTok’s US operations to Elon Musk, who would combine them with his existing social media platform X, according to Bloomberg. TikTok called the report “pure fiction” in a statement to Variety. On Friday, Trump said that he had a “very good” call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about TikTok and other policy issues.\nGetting rid of TikTok was not a particularly popular policy among the American public. Thirty-two percent of US adults said they supported the government banning the app in 2024, down from fifty percent in 2023, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Thirty-nine percent said they weren’t sure about the idea.\nTikTok users spent the week flooding the platform with videos expressing their outrage and despair over the looming threat of an imminent ban. One song with bitterly sarcastic lyrics mocking the US government’s misplaced priorities became their rallying cry: “If you’re asking me, the biggest problem is TikTok It’s not global warming, not access to healthcare—welfare, boring! Corruption at the top, citizens getting shot, With all that’s going on, now’s the perfect time for banning TikTok.”\nHundreds of thousands of US TikTok users also flocked to another Chinese-owned platform, RedNote, in a defiant move meant to show just how little they cared about the national security concerns lawmakers said motivated their decision to ban TikTok. “I don’t fucking care that China has my data, are you joking?” TikTok creator Imani Barbarin said in a video that received nearly 1 million likes. “Everybody has my data.”",

Learn more.\nEarlier this month, Native unveiled a Dunkin’-themed personal care line: a sugary spread of body washes, deodorants, lotions, shampoos, and conditioners in the familiar (to some) scents of Vanilla Sprinkle, Strawberry Frosted, Blueberry Cobbler, and Boston Kreme. Social media, as always, was split. Half of the internet rushed to snag a bottle (or five), while the other half dunked on the idea of smelling like Ben Affleck’s breakfast order.\nThis isn’t Native’s first bite at the food collab apple. Its partnership with Mexican soda juggernaut Jarritos—still available for purchase—turned nostalgic soft drinks into skin-friendly suds. Dove, not to be outdone, teamed up with Crumbl Cookies to launch a limited-edition lineup of soaps, scrubs, and deodorants in Strawberry Crumb Cake, Lemon Glaze, and Confetti Cake. Dove even swapped its signature white packaging for Crumbl’s bubblegum pink, a first for the brand.\nIt’s absurd. It’s viral. And it’s working. The food-beauty crossover is suddenly everywhere. It is the allure of nostalgia, the pull of meme culture, and the sticky-sweet scent of capitalism wafting through the air. Most importantly, we are eating it up.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year.

As early as 1975, Lip Smacker debuted its first flavor collaboration with Dr. Pepper, transforming lip balm into a collectible. The trend—what we now call “gourmand” scents, which is to say, synthetic scents that smell like delicious food—was popularized by Thierry Mugler's iconic Angel perfume, which has been described as getting hit in the face with a ball of cotton candy.\nBy the early 2000s, the trend had trickled down as tweens hoarded Lip Smackers in flavors like Fanta and Skittles, while Bath & Body Works Cucumber Melon body spray ruled girls’ locker rooms (if you know, you know). In the 2010s, brands like Too Faced leaned into the aesthetic with palettes shaped like chocolate bars. Even Dunkin’—back when it was still calling itself Dunkin’ Donuts—dipped its toes into the trend in 2019 with a nail polish line.\nBut in 2023, we moved from food-inspired aesthetics to actually wanting to look like food, with trends like cinnamon cookie butter hair, blueberry milk nails, and glazed doughnut skin. Today, anything goes: Velveeta hair dye, dill-pickle-flavored lube, and Hellman’s parfum de mayonnaise—the rule seems to be the more unhinged, the better.\nFor millennials and zillennials, these products are a sensory trip down memory lane, reviving the candy-scented mall staples of our youth. For Gen Z, it’s a clash of high and low—a clean beauty brand like Native rubbing shoulders with a fast food institution like Dunkin’.\nSo Happy Together\nTikTok, with its algorithmic obsession with the absurd, thrives on these edible beauty launches. The marketing strategy borrows liberally from streetwear’s scarcity playbook, implementing limited-edition drops designed to create urgency and exclusivity. But unfortunately, these products aren’t built to last. They’re flashpoints for FOMO-prone shoppers and sentimentalists looking to romanticize their routines. For Gen Z, the more bizarre the concept, the faster it seems to circulate.\nFood and beverage (F&B) licensing is a lucrative avenue for these partnerships. According to Licensing International’s 2023 Global Licensing Industry Study, F&B grew by 5.3 percent, and the cosmetic industry is dipping its manicured fingers into the pie. Everyone benefits from these symbiotic relationships, as food franchises use the shareability of #BeautyTok to sprinkle their branding into new markets.\nThe result is a syrupy cocktail of millennial nostalgia and Gen Z irony that generates free advertising via memes, TikTok reactions, and social media discourse.\nSo, what’s next? Crunchwrap-scented cologne? Hot Cheetos-flavored toothpaste? Perhaps a McRib collagen serum? As brands push the boundaries of absurdity, the question isn’t whether they’ll go too far, it’s when we hit our breaking point. Novelty has a shelf life.\nWithout meaningful innovation, the joke risks wearing thin, much like some of these franchises themselves. In the meantime, though, there’s a cautionary tale: The punch line here is the consumer, not the product. We don't want to wake up tomorrow smelling like Cheetos and pickles and realize that the joke’s on us.",

    "content_text": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\nFirefighters battling the deadly wildfires that raced through the Los Angeles area in January 2025 have been hampered by a limited supply of fresh water. So, when the winds are calm enough, skilled pilots flying planes aptly named Super Scoopers are skimming off 1,500 gallons of sea water at a time and dumping it with high precision on the fires.\nUsing seawater to fight fires can sound like a simple solution—the Pacific Ocean has a seemingly endless supply of water. In emergencies like Southern California is facing, it’s often the only quick solution, though the operation can be risky amid ocean swells.\nBut seawater also has downsides.\nSalt water corrodes firefighting equipment and may harm ecosystems, especially those like the chaparral shrublands around Los Angeles that aren’t normally exposed to seawater. Gardeners know that small amounts of salt—added, say, as fertilizer—does not harm plants, but excessive salts can stress and kill plants.\nWhile the consequences of adding seawater to ecosystems are not yet well understood, we can gain insights on what to expect by considering the effects of sea level rise.\nA Seawater Experiment in a Coastal Forest\nAs an ecosystem ecologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, I lead a novel experiment called TEMPEST that was designed to understand how and why historically salt-free coastal forests react to their first exposures to salty water.\nSea-level rise has increased by an average of about 8 inches globally over the past century, and that water has pushed salty water into US forests, farms, and neighborhoods that had previously known only fresh water. As the rate of sea level rise accelerates, storms push seawater ever farther onto the dry land, eventually killing trees and creating ghost forests, a result of climate change that is widespread in the US and globally.\nIn our TEMPEST test plots, we pump salty water from the nearby Chesapeake Bay into tanks, then sprinkle it on the forest soil surface fast enough to saturate the soil for about 10 hours at a time. This simulates a surge of salty water during a big storm.\nOur coastal forest showed little effect from the first 10-hour exposure to salty water in June 2022 and grew normally for the rest of the year. We increased the exposure to 20 hours in June 2023, and the forest still appeared mostly unfazed, although the tulip poplar trees were drawing water from the soil more slowly, which may be an early warning signal.\nThings changed after a 30-hour exposure in June 2024. The leaves of tulip poplar in the forests started to brown in mid-August, several weeks earlier than normal. By mid-September the forest canopy was bare, as if winter had set in. These changes did not occur in a nearby plot that we treated the same way, but with fresh water rather than seawater.\nThe initial resilience of our forest can be explained in part by the relatively low amount of salt in the water in this estuary, where water from freshwater rivers and a salty ocean mix. Rain that fell after the experiments in 2022 and 2023 washed salts out of the soil.\nBut a major drought followed the 2024 experiment, so salts lingered in the soil then. The trees’ longer exposure to salty soils after our 2024 experiment may have exceeded their ability to tolerate these conditions.\nSeawater being dumped on the Southern California fires is full-strength, salty ocean water. And conditions there have been very dry, particularly compared with our East Coast forest plot.\nChanges Evident in the Ground\nOur research group is still trying to understand all the factors that limit the forest’s tolerance to salty water, and how our results apply to other ecosystems such as those in the Los Angeles area.\nTree leaves turning from green to brown well before fall was a surprise, but there were other surprises hidden in the soil below our feet.\nRainwater percolating through the soil is normally clear, but about a month after the first and only 10-hour exposure to salty water in 2022, the soil water turned brown and stayed that way for two years. The brown color comes from carbon-based compounds leached from dead plant material. It’s a process similar to making tea.\nOur lab experiments suggest that salt was causing clay and other particles to disperse and move about in the soil. Such changes in soil chemistry and structure can persist for many years.\nSea-Level Rise Is Increasing Coastal Exposure\nWhile ocean water can help fight fires, there are reasons fire officials prefer freshwater sources—provided fresh water is available.\nUS coastlines, meanwhile, are facing more extensive and frequent saltwater exposure as rising global temperatures accelerate sea level rise that drowns forests, fields, and farms, with unknown risks for coastal landscapes.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIf you've got yourself a Kindle for e-book reading—maybe a brand-new model like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition or Kindle Colorsoft—then you'll know these devices are brilliantly simple in terms of their interfaces and controls. The focus is on the text and whatever you happen to be reading.\nBehind the simple and friendly interface though, the Kindle has more features and tricks than you might expect. Sure, these e-readers aren't going to compete with iPads for functionality, but there's a lot you can do with them—from customizing the reading experience to getting content other than ebooks onto the screen.\n1. Look Up Words\nDon't be flummoxed by unfamiliar words you come across while reading. You can get definitions for anything onscreen just by pressing and holding on the word. When the definition appears, you can swipe to the left to see if there's a Wikipedia entry for the word, and swipe left again to have the word translated into another language.\n2. Send Web Articles to Your Kindle\nYou can also use your Kindle to catch up on your online reading, by sending web articles to the device. Perhaps the easiest option is the official Kindle extension for Google Chrome—as long as you only want to send articles from a desktop web browser. Once you're signed into your Amazon account, article transfers only take a few clicks.\nThe Kindle extension is quick and free, but it doesn't always get web page formatting right, and it doesn't work on mobile. Instapaper does a better job with its own Kindle-sync service, but you need the $6-per-month premium plan to access it. Push to Kindle is good too, but a $3-per-month subscription is required to send more than 10 articles per month.\n3. Take a Screenshot\nYou can take screenshots on a Kindle, if you want to show off your library or share a passage from a book on social media, for example. Just tap two diagonally opposite corners, right in the corner. The screen flashes, and the screengrab is saved. Connect your Kindle up to a computer with a USB cable, and you'll find all your screenshots saved in their own dedicated folder.\n4. Sort Your Ebooks Into Collections\nAs you add more and more ebooks (and web articles) to your library, it can start to get a bit unwieldy—and sorting through it to find your next read becomes more difficult. You can mitigate this to some extent by creating collections. These are essentially folders to sort titles into, whether it's by genre, by author, or how soon you want to read them.\nTo get started, from the Kindle’s homepage tap the three dots in the top right, then Create a Collection. Give your collection a name, and mark it as a favorite if you want (which makes it appear more prominently across various screens). You can then opt to sort the Library page by collections—just tap the sort-by icon, the three horizontal lines in the top right.\n5. See Book Covers More Often\nIf you miss the old experience of seeing the cover every time you close your paper book, you can get the digital equivalent by setting the cover of the ebook you're currently reading as the Kindle screensaver. From the home screen, tap the three dots (top right), then choose Settings > Screen and brightness and enable the Show covers on lock screen option.\n6. Change the Screen Warmth\nIf you have a Kindle Paperwhite, Oasis, or Colorsoft, you can access a warmth setting for the screen—this changes the tint of the display, so your eyes don't have to strain so much when reading text. To find the relevant settings from the homepage, tap the three dots (top right), then Settings > Screen and brightness > Brightness and warmth.\nThis can be especially useful late at night, when you might be reading in the dark, but you can use it anytime and in any scenario you like. Adjust the Warmth slider as needed, and turn on the Warmth schedule toggle switch to get the display to adjust automatically based on the time of day. You can set start and end times, and a level of warmth.\n7. Check Your Progress\nTap down in the bottom-left corner of the screen to change how your progress through the current ebook is indicated. You can see your current page number (based on font size and page settings), your current reading location as a fixed number, the reading time remaining in the current chapter, and the reading time remaining for the whole ebook. These times get adjusted dynamically as your Kindle tracks how quickly you’re progressing through each book.\n8. Install the Other Kindle Apps\nBesides using the Kindle device, you can also install Kindle apps for Android and iOS, as well as Windows and macOS. There's even a web app for reading in the browser. While the reading experience on these other screens isn't quite as good as it is on a dedicated e-reader, as long as you use the same Amazon account, all of your reading across all of these devices will be synced up.\nThat means you can grab five minutes of reading time on the bus on your phone, even if you don't have your actual Kindle; or you can get through a few pages between meetings on your laptop. When you pick up your e-reader again, you'll find your reading position updated, and it's a simple trick for getting through your list of ebooks more quickly.\n9. Get a Text Style You’re Comfortable With\nTap near the top of the page when reading a book, then tap the Aa icon, and you can access a range of options to get the text onscreen looking exactly the way you want. You're able to adjust the spacing between lines, the alignment of paragraphs, the style and size of the main font, and even the size of the page margins.",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><figure class=\"CneAudioEmbedFigure-bWHoMv hIHLrt\" data-testid=\"cne-audio-embed-figure\"></figure><p class=\"paywall\"><span class=\"lead-in-text-callout\">If you've got</span> yourself a Kindle for e-book reading—maybe a brand-new model like the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-2024/\">Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/kindle-colorsoft/\">Kindle Colorsoft</a>—then you'll know these devices are brilliantly simple in terms of their interfaces and controls. The focus is on the text and whatever you happen to be reading.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Behind the simple and friendly interface though, the Kindle has more features and tricks than you might expect. Sure, these e-readers aren't going to compete with iPads for functionality, but there's a lot you can do with them—from customizing the reading experience to getting content other than ebooks onto the screen.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class=\"paywall\">1. Look Up Words</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Don't be flummoxed by unfamiliar words you come across while reading. You can get definitions for anything onscreen just by pressing and holding on the word. When the definition appears, you can swipe to the left to see if there's a Wikipedia entry for the word, and swipe left again to have the word translated into another language.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">2. Send Web Articles to Your Kindle</h2><p class=\"paywall\">You can also use your Kindle to catch up on your online reading, by sending web articles to the device. Perhaps the easiest option is <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/chrome\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/chrome\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/chrome\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the official Kindle extension</a> for Google Chrome—as long as you only want to send articles from a desktop web browser. Once you're signed into your Amazon account, article transfers only take a few clicks.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">The Kindle extension is quick and free, but it doesn't always get web page formatting right, and it doesn't work on mobile. <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.instapaper.com/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.instapaper.com/\" href=\"https://www.instapaper.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instapaper</a> does a better job with its own Kindle-sync service, but you need the $6-per-month premium plan to access it. <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.pushtokindle.com/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.pushtokindle.com/\" href=\"https://www.pushtokindle.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Push to Kindle</a> is good too, but a $3-per-month subscription is required to send more than 10 articles per month.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>Use the Kindle Chrome extension to send articles to your e-reader.</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">David Nield</span></div></figure><h2 class=\"paywall\">3. Take a Screenshot</h2><p class=\"paywall\">You can take screenshots on a Kindle, if you want to show off your library or share a passage from a book on social media, for example. Just tap two diagonally opposite corners, right in the corner. The screen flashes, and the screengrab is saved. Connect your Kindle up to a computer with a USB cable, and you'll find all your screenshots saved in their own dedicated folder.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">4. Sort Your Ebooks Into Collections</h2><p class=\"paywall\">As you add more and more ebooks (and web articles) to your library, it can start to get a bit unwieldy—and sorting through it to find your next read becomes more difficult. You can mitigate this to some extent by creating collections. These are essentially folders to sort titles into, whether it's by genre, by author, or how soon you want to read them.</p><p class=\"paywall\">To get started, from the Kindle’s homepage tap the three dots in the top right, then <strong>Create a Collection</strong>. Give your collection a name, and mark it as a favorite if you want (which makes it appear more prominently across various screens). You can then opt to sort the Library page by collections—just tap the sort-by icon, the three horizontal lines in the top right.</p></div></div></body></html>",

Essential oils have been promoted as “immune support” for people trying to prevent Covid, and a huge body of evidence-less products have sprung up for people who want to “detox” from the effects of Covid vaccines or being near people who have been vaccinated. (Vaccine detox was promoted by some in the alt-wellness world even before Covid.)\n“Wellness influencers are always leveraging tragedies,” DeMille points out, “but typically they’re personal tragedies”—say, telling sick people to try their products while undergoing cancer treatments or chronic illness.\n“Leveraging a community tragedy isn’t that long of a walk,” she adds.\nAs climate disasters continue to happen more frequently—and the world faces a new potential pandemic in the form of bird flu—business looks extremely good for wellness influencers adept at turning disease and disasters into marketing hooks.",

    "content_text": "As the Biden administration comes to a close, the White House released a 40-page executive order on Thursday aimed at shoring up federal cybersecurity protections and placing guardrails on the US government’s use of AI. WIRED also spoke with outgoing US ambassador for cyberspace and digital policy, Nathaniel Fick, about the urgency that the Trump administration not cow to Russia and China in the global race for technical dominance. Outgoing FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel details to WIRED the threats facing US telecoms, at least nine of which were recently breached by China’s Salt Typhoon hackers. Meanwhile, US officials are still scrambling to get a handle on multiple espionage campaigns and other data breaches, with new revelations this week that a breach of AT&T disclosed last summer compromised FBI call and text logs that could reveal the identity of anonymous sources.\nHuione Guarantee, the massive online marketplace that researchers say provides an array of services to online scammers, is expanding its offerings to include a messaging app, stablecoin, and crypto exchange and has facilitated a whopping $24 billion in transactions, according to new research. New findings indicate that GitHub’s efforts to crack down on the use of deepfake porn software are falling short. And WIRED did a deep dive into the opaque world of predictive travel surveillance and the companies and governments that are pumping data about international travelers into AI tools meant to detect people who might be a “threat.”\nBut wait, there's more! Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\nUS Names One of the Chinese Hackers Allegedly Behind Massive Salt Typhoon Intrusions\nChina spies, the US spies, everybody spies. Mutual espionage is a geopolitical game played by virtually every nation in the world. So when the US government singles out a single hacker for espionage-focused intrusions, naming him and targeting him with sanctions, he must have spied aggressively—or effectively—enough to have made powerful people very angry.\nThe US Treasury on Friday imposed sanctions on Yin Kecheng, a 39-year old Chinese man accused of being involved in both the breach of nine US telecommunications companies carried out by the Chinese hacker group known as Salt Typhoon, as well as another recent breach of the US Treasury. In a statement about the news, Treasury alleges that Yin is affiliated with China’s Ministry of State Security and has been a “cyber actor” for over a decade. It also imposed sanctions on Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology, a company that Treasury says is also associated with Salt Typhoon.\nSalt Typhoon’s breach of US telecoms gave Chinese hackers enormous access to the real-time texts and phone calls of Americans, and was reportedly used to spy on president-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect JD Vance, among other targets. FBI director Christopher Wray has called the telecom breaches China’s \"most significant cyberespionage campaign in history.”\nChina’s Silk Typhoon Hackers Targeted Sanctions and Intelligence in Treasury Breach\nAs the Treasury hits back at China’s spy operations, it’s also still working to determine the scope of the intrusion some of those same hackers carried out inside its network. An internal Treasury report obtained by Bloomberg found that hackers had penetrated at least 400 of the agency’s PCs and stolen more than 3,000 files in a recent breach. The espionage-focused intrusion appears to have gone after sanctions and law-enforcement related information, the report found, as well as other intelligence materials. Despite that vast access, the intruders didn’t gain access to Treasury’s emails or classified portions of its network, the report states, nor did they leave behind malware that would suggest an attempt at maintaining longer-term access.\nFBI Uninstalls Chinese PlugX Malware From Thousands of Machines\nThe Justice Department revealed this week that the FBI carried out an operation to delete a specimen of malware known as PlugX from 4,200 computers around the world. The malware, which was typically transmitted to computers via infected USB drives, has persisted for at least a decade and been used at times by Chinese state-sponsored hacker groups to target Chinese dissidents. In July of last year, cybersecurity firm Sekoia and French law enforcement took over the command-and-control server behind the malware. This week, the FBI obtained a court order that allowed the bureau to send a self-destruct command to the software on infected machines.\nVictims of “PowerSchool” Edtech Data Breach Say “All” of Their Student and Teacher Info Was Stolen\nAfter news earlier this week of a cyberattack in December that breached the US education technology platform PowerSchool, school districts targeted in the intrusion told TechCrunch on Thursday that attackers gained access to “all” stored student and teacher data in their accounts. PowerSchool is used by more than 60 million K-12 students in the US. Hackers gained access to the information by stealing login credentials that gave them access to the company’s customer support portal. The attack has not yet been publicly linked to a specific perpetrator. PowerSchool has not yet disclosed the exact number of victim schools nor whether all of its customers were affected.",

Meanwhile, US officials are still scrambling to get a handle on multiple espionage campaigns and other data breaches, with new revelations this week that a breach of AT&amp;T disclosed last summer <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-likely-stole-fbi-call-logs-from-att-that-could-compromise-informants/\">compromised FBI call and text logs that could reveal the identity of anonymous sources</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Huione Guarantee, the massive online marketplace that researchers say provides an array of services to online scammers, is expanding its offerings to include a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-black-box-of-predictive-travel-surveillance/\">messaging app, stablecoin, and crypto exchange and has facilitated a whopping $24 billion in transactions</a>, according to new research. New findings indicate that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/githubs-deepfake-porn-crackdown-still-isnt-working/\">GitHub’s efforts to crack down on the use of deepfake porn software are falling short</a>. And WIRED did a deep dive into the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-black-box-of-predictive-travel-surveillance/\">opaque world of predictive travel surveillance and the companies and governments that are pumping data</a> about international travelers into AI tools meant to detect people who might be a “threat.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">But wait, there's more! Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">China spies, the US spies, everybody spies. Mutual espionage is a geopolitical game played by virtually every nation in the world. So when the US government singles out a single hacker for espionage-focused intrusions, naming him and targeting him with sanctions, he must have spied aggressively—or effectively—enough to have made powerful people very angry.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">The US Treasury on Friday imposed sanctions on Yin Kecheng, a 39-year old Chinese man accused of being involved in both the breach of nine US telecommunications companies carried out by the Chinese hacker group known as Salt Typhoon, as well as another recent breach of the US Treasury. In a statement about the news, Treasury alleges that Yin is affiliated with China’s Ministry of State Security and has been a “cyber actor” for over a decade. It also imposed sanctions on Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology, a company that Treasury says is also associated with Salt Typhoon.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Salt Typhoon’s breach of US telecoms gave Chinese hackers enormous access to the real-time texts and phone calls of Americans, and was reportedly used to spy on president-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect JD Vance, among other targets. FBI director Christopher Wray has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86w2evj05do\">called</a> the telecom breaches China’s \"most significant cyberespionage campaign in history.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">As the Treasury hits back at China’s spy operations, it’s also still working to determine the scope of the intrusion some of those same hackers carried out inside its network. An internal Treasury report obtained by Bloomberg found that hackers had penetrated at least 400 of the agency’s PCs and stolen more than 3,000 files in a recent breach. The espionage-focused intrusion appears to have gone after sanctions and law-enforcement related information, the report found, as well as other intelligence materials. Despite that vast access, the intruders didn’t gain access to Treasury’s emails or classified portions of its network, the report states, nor did they leave behind malware that would suggest an attempt at maintaining longer-term access.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The Justice Department revealed this week that the FBI carried out an operation to delete a specimen of malware known as PlugX from 4,200 computers around the world. The malware, which was typically transmitted to computers via infected USB drives, has persisted for at least a decade and been used at times by Chinese state-sponsored hacker groups to target Chinese dissidents. In July of last year, cybersecurity firm Sekoia and French law enforcement took over the command-and-control server behind the malware. This week, the FBI obtained a court order that allowed the bureau to send a self-destruct command to the software on infected machines.</p><p class=\"paywall\">After news earlier this week of a cyberattack in December that breached the US education technology platform PowerSchool, school districts targeted in the intrusion told TechCrunch on Thursday that attackers gained access to “all” stored student and teacher data in their accounts. PowerSchool is used by more than 60 million K-12 students in the US. Hackers gained access to the information by stealing login credentials that gave them access to the company’s customer support portal. The attack has not yet been publicly linked to a specific perpetrator. PowerSchool has not yet disclosed the exact number of victim schools nor whether all of its customers were affected.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "As the United States scrambles to kick China out of its communications networks, Jessica Rosenworcel, the outgoing Democratic chair of the Federal Communications Commission, says it’s vital for her Republican successor to maintain strong oversight of the telecommunications industry.\nThe government is still reeling from the Chinese “Salt Typhoon” hacking campaign that penetrated at least nine US telecom companies and gave Beijing access to Americans’ phone calls and text messages and the wiretap systems used by law enforcement. The operation exploited US carriers’ shockingly poor cybersecurity, including an AT&T administrator account that lacked basic security protections.\nTo prevent a repeat of the unprecedented telecom intrusion, Rosenworcel used the waning days of her FCC leadership to propose new cybersecurity requirements for telecom operators. On Thursday, the commission narrowly voted to approve her proposal. But those rules face a bleak future, with president-elect Donald Trump preparing to take office and control of the FCC transferring to commissioner Brendan Carr, a Trump ally who voted against Rosenworcel’s regulatory plan.\nIn an interview days before Trump’s inauguration, Rosenworcel is adamant that regulation is part of the answer to America’s telecom security crisis. And she has a stern message for Republicans who think the solution is to let the telecoms police themselves.\n“We are wrestling with what has been described as the worst telecommunications hack in our nation's history,” she says. “Either you take serious action or you don't.”\n“The Right Thing to Do”\nRosenworcel’s plan consists of two steps. First, the FCC formally declared that the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which required telecom companies to design their phone and internet systems to comply with wiretaps, also requires them to implement basic cyber defenses to prevent tampering. Next, the FCC proposed requiring a wider range of companies regulated by the commission to develop detailed cyber risk-management plans and annually attest to their implementation.\nThe outgoing chairwoman describes the rules as a commonsense response to a devastating attack.\n“In the United States in 2025, it would shock most consumers to know that our networks do not have minimum cybersecurity standards,” Rosenworcel says. “We're asking the carriers to develop a plan and certify they follow that plan. That's the right thing to do.”\nAbsent these standards, she adds, “our networks are going to lack the protection they need from nation-state threats like this in the future.”\nBut Republicans are unlikely to embrace the new regulations on telecom networks. The powerful telecom industry tends to staunchly oppose any new regulations, and Republicans almost always side with the industry in these debates.\nSenator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who now chairs the Commerce Committee, called Rosenworcel’s plan “a Band-Aid at best and a concealment of a serious blind spot at worst” during a hearing in December.\nCarr—who last month called Salt Typhoon “deeply concerning”—voted against Rosenworcel’s proposal, along with his fellow Republican commissioner Nathan Simington. Carr’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment about the new regulations. But he has repeatedly criticized Rosenworcel’s approach to enforcing rules on the telecom industry, accusing her of overreach and warning that the FCC must rein itself in or face pushback from courts.\nOnce Carr takes over as FCC chairman, he could call a new vote of the commission to rescind Rosenworcel’s regulations. Or he could let Republican lawmakers do it for him—the GOP-controlled Congress is already planning to undo another FCC rule and might be happy to add this one to their list.\nRosenworcel dismisses the idea that her plan is radical. “We are not reinventing the wheel here,” she says. The new cyber requirements would be pegged to existing consensus standards from the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n“Voices from the left and the right have called this the worst telecommunications hack in our nation's history,” Rosenworcel says. “It deserves a serious response.”\nModernizing an Old Law\nOne potential challenge facing Rosenworcel’s plan is that it hinges on the 30-year-old CALEA, which says almost nothing about cybersecurity.\nSection 105 of the law does require telecoms to ensure that wiretaps “can be activated only in accordance with a court order or other lawful authorization,” which Rosenworcel reads as a requirement to protect telecom networks from unauthorized access. But after the US Supreme Court’s recent ruling that courts shouldn’t defer to agencies as the experts in their policies, the FCC will almost certainly face an industry lawsuit as it tries to implement Rosenworcel’s plan.\nCarr may have opposed the proposal in part for that reason. He has repeatedly cheered court decisions invalidating Biden administration tech policies and the FCC’s own previous actions, and in congressional testimony last July, he cited the risk of courtroom setbacks in opposing FCC subsidies for school and library Wi-Fi hot spots (the FCC program that Congress is preparing to invalidate). “Following the Supreme Court’s decision,” he said, “courts will not defer to an FCC decision to read into the Communications Act a grant of authority that Congress did not provide.”\nRosenworcel defends the use of CALEA, saying “we have to step back and look at it from a broader point of view.” Section 105 clearly supports the conclusion that “every telecommunications carrier has a legal obligation to secure their networks against unlawful access and interception,” she argues.\nThe chairwoman admits that her proposal is “a modern way to think about” CALEA, but she says her staff “worked closely with our general counsel's office” to ensure its legality.\n“This is the right and proper interpretation of the law that meets the moment we're in and the threats we face,” she says.\nNew Sheriff in Town\nAs the Rosenworcel era gives way to the Carr era at the FCC, one open question is how the commission’s relationship with the telecom industry will change, and how that will affect the companies’ commitment to improving cybersecurity.\nBusinesses typically have friendlier relationships with independent regulators when they’re led by Republicans, who tend to favor hands-off approaches to overseeing their industries. From that perspective, telecom firms—which slammed the FCC for its recently thwarted attempt to reinstate net neutrality—are likely to welcome Carr’s promises to rein in the commission’s “overreach.”\nBut it is unclear how that shift will affect the incentives driving telecoms’ investments in better cybersecurity practices. Security experts have already expressed concerns about the broader Trump administration’s likely retreat from Biden-era cyber rules for critical infrastructure operators. A similar trend could play out with the FCC in the telecom space.\nUncertain Future for an Ambitious Agenda\nEven beyond Salt Typhoon’s breach of US telecom systems, there are many questions about how the FCC will tackle cybersecurity after Rosenworcel departs.\n“One of the hallmarks of my tenure has been that we put network security and national security front and center,” she says. “I've been in and around the FCC for a long time, and this issue has never had top-tier billing like it has during my time here.”\nRosenworcel’s initiatives included banning Chinese wireless firms from providing services in the US, prohibiting telecom equipment manufacturers linked to foreign adversaries from selling their products in the US, and running a multibillion-dollar program to help US carriers “rip and replace” that risky equipment.\nUnder Rosenworcel, the FCC also proposed rules to secure the internet’s traffic-routing system, protect undersea cables from tampering, and update 16-year-old data-breach notification procedures; launched a privacy and data protection task force; created a pilot program to help schools and libraries improve their cyber defenses; and fined the major US wireless carriers for selling access to customers’ locations. Most recently, Rosenworcel worked with the White House to launch an FCC-run security labeling program for internet-of-things devices.\nThe rip-and-replace program is an especially ambitious effort. More than 100 US wireless carriers have reported using equipment made by risky companies like China’s Huawei. But Rosenworcel is confident that the program—which recently received a $3 billion infusion from Congress—is on the right track. “We're doing a good job working with carriers to take this equipment out,” she says.\nRosenworcel isn’t worried that carriers will simply refuse to participate. “If you have this equipment in your networks, you can't get funds from FCC programs,” she says. “Right there, you have a pretty powerful incentive.” She thinks that incentive will be especially strong for the most vulnerable organizations: the small, rural carriers that heavily depend on federal subsidies.\nThe IoT labeling program, known as the US Cyber Trust Mark, might be even more ambitious, given that its goal is to completely change how consumers and businesses think about the importance of cybersecurity in home appliances. But Rosenworcel says a lot of manufacturers are “very excited” about getting their products tested and marked with the federal seal of approval, because “they see it as a way to differentiate their products in the marketplace.”\nAs for consumers, Rosenworcel admits that they may not start shopping based on security right away, but she compares the program to Energy Star, which launched in 1992 and is now a household name. “This is an iterative process,” she says. “It's going to create its own momentum over time, and these are just early days.”\nWhile a group of FCC-designated organizations devise specific testing criteria for the program, Rosenworcel is concerned that other countries may leap ahead with their own security labels. South Korea and Singapore signed an agreement in December 2023 to mutually recognize each other’s labels. The US and the European Union are working on similar reciprocity. “There will be a race globally to develop these kind of marks,” Rosenworcel says. “This is an area where I think the US should really invest some time, energy, and effort, because I would like us to lead.”\nEscaping the “Analog Era”\nAs she counts down her final days atop the FCC, Rosenworcel is preoccupied with how Salt Typhoon has highlighted alarming vulnerabilities in systems that underpin American prosperity.\n“Network security is national security,” she says. “Communications is an input in everything we do in day-to-day life. You don't have health care, manufacturing, energy, transportation, any of it without secure communications.”\nThose dependencies have put the US in increasing jeopardy as foreign government hackers exploit these networks’ complexity and inconsistency.\n“We have portions [of networks] that are gleaming new and operate on internet protocols, and we've got others that are built for the analog era,” Rosenworcel notes. “There are consequences to having networks like this that are overseen by commercial actors … Some equipment and facilities have not been updated.”\nRepublicans may be tempted to leave it up to the industry to shore up these vulnerabilities. But Rosenworcel says that would be a costly mistake.\n“We have a choice to make,” she says. “We take action to prevent this from happening in the future, or we turn the other way, cross our fingers, and hope it never happens again. I like hope, but hope isn't a plan. And when you look at the scope of the threats that we're facing, it would be foolhardy to just rely on hope at this point.”",

    "content_text": "The US Supreme Court upheld a law on Friday that could result in a ban on TikTok in the United States this Sunday.\n“There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,” the court's unanimous opinion reads. “But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.”\nFor more than five years, US government officials have tried to ban or force a sale of TikTok, accusing the Chinese-owned company of sharing American user data with the Chinese government and filling feeds with pro-China propaganda. Congress and agencies like the FBI have not provided the public with much information that confirms these allegations, but pursued a variety of different methods to ban TikTok.\nResponding to the decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew released a video on the platform thanking incoming president Donald Trump for supporting the app. \"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform,” Chew said. “One who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspective connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process.\"\nChew did not comment on whether TikTok would officially shut down on Sunday, but said “Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery, as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come.”\nIn 2020, former president Donald Trump first attempted to ban TikTok through a failed executive order. Ultimately, President Joe Biden signed into law a bill on April 24, 2024, requiring TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app to an American owner by January 19 or be removed from US app stores. In a rush to stave off the ban, TikTok and a group of creators quickly filed lawsuits against the Justice Department, arguing that the law, the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, violates their First Amendment rights.\nIn Friday’s oral arguments, TikTok’s lawyer Noel Francisco and Jeffrey Fisher, who represents the creators, attempted to drive home that argument. For the government, solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the law did not violate the free speech rights of the defendants, and instead severed the app from ByteDance and Chinese influence.\n“Without doubt, the remedy Congress and the President chose here is dramatic,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a concurring opinion. “Whether this law will succeed in achieving its ends, I do not know. A determined foreign adversary may just seek to replace one lost surveillance application with another. As time passes and threats evolve, less dramatic and more effective solutions may emerge.”\nIn its opinion, the court casts doubt on TikTok’s central argument that the law violated the company’s free speech rights, writing that the “challenged provisions are facially content neutral.” The justices wrote that the law does not appear to regulate the speech of TikTok or its creators, and instead targets the app and ByteDance’s corporate structure.\n“It is not clear that the Act itself directly regulates protected expressive activity, or conduct with an expressive component,” the opinion reads. “And it directly regulates Bytedance Ltd. and TikTok only through the divestiture requirements.”\nThe justices note that their decision should be seen as “narrowly focused” and applies strictly to TikTok. “TikTok’s scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the Government’s national security concerns,” the opinion reads.\nThe law allows Biden to extend the January 19 deadline an additional 90 days so long as ByteDance is nearing a sale. As of Wednesday, the Biden administration is reportedly searching for ways to save the app, but it has not disclosed anything publicly. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED on Friday. A handful of US-based financiers have lined up to buy the app, including former LA Dodgers owner Frank McCourt. Kevin O’Leary, or “Mr. Wonderful,” of Shark Tank fame, has signed on to McCourt’s proposal and recently met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago.\n“We have a formal offer on the table with ByteDance. We are ready to work with the company and President Trump to complete a deal. Together, we can transition TikTok to a clean tech stack and turn this national security problem into a big win for Americans,” McCourt said in a statement responding to the decision on Friday.\nWhile rumors have spread that ByteDance could be pursuing a sale with Elon Musk, TikTok and its owner have not confirmed any of these reports.\nOn Thursday, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer joined a growing chorus of US lawmakers, many of whom voted in favor of the ban, looking to give the company more time to find a suitable buyer.\nDespite being the first president to try banning TikTok, incoming president Donald Trump has suggested that he would try to broker a deal that could save the app once he returns to the White House. In an amicus brief filed last month, Trump asked the court to pause the law from going into effect to allow for him to find a “political resolution” to save it. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is reportedly attending Trump’s inauguration on Monday.\nTrump said that he spoke with Chinese president Xi Jinping over the phone in a Friday morning Truth Social post. “It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately. We discussed balancing Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects.”\n“The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it,” Trump wrote in another Truth Social post on Friday. “My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!”\n“By refusing to block this ban, the Supreme Court is giving the executive branch unprecedented power to silence speech it doesn’t like, increasing the danger that sweeping invocations of ‘national security’ will trump our constitutional rights,” Patrick Toomey, deputy director of the ACLU’s National Security Project said in a statement on Friday.\nUnless TikTok decides to shut down the app on its own, US users will likely be able to use it for at least the near future. The law forbids mobile app stores from providing access to TikTok and would make it difficult for new users to download the app. TikTok will continue to work for users who already have the app on their phone, but they will no longer have access to updates, which could make TikTok glitchier and possibly unusable over time.",

    "content_text": "There was a time when Mark Zuckerberg didn’t regard mainstream media as the enemy. He even allowed me, a card-carrying legacy media person, into his home. In April 2018, I ventured there to hear his plans to do the right thing. It was part of my years-long embed into Facebook to write a book. For the past two years, Zuckerberg’s company had been roundly criticized for its failure to rein in disinformation and hate speech. Now the young founder had a plan to address this.\nPart of the solution, he told me, was more content moderation. He was going to hire many more humans to vet posts, even if it cost Facebook considerable capital. He would also amp up efforts to use artificial intelligence to proactively remove harmful content. “It is no longer enough to give people tools to say what they want and then just let our community flag them and try to respond after the fact,” he told me as we sat in his sunroom. “We need to get in there more and just take a more active role.” He admitted he had been slow to realize how damaging toxic content was on Facebook, but now he was committed to fixing the problem, even though it might take years. “I think we're doing the right thing,” he told me, “It’s just that we should've done it sooner.”\nSeven years later, Zuckerberg no longer thinks more moderation is the right thing. In a five-minute Reel, he characterized his actions to support it as a regretful cave-in to government jawboning about Covid and other subjects. He announced a shift away from content moderation—no more proactive takedowns and downranking of misinformation and hate speech—and the end of a fact-checking program that aimed to refute lies circulating on his platforms. Fact checks by trusted sources would be replaced by “community notes,” a crowdsourcing approach where users provide alternate views on the veracity of posts. That technique is the exact thing that he told me in 2018 was “not enough.” While he admits now his changes will allow “more bad stuff,” he says that in 2025 it is worth it for more “free expression” to thrive.\nThe policy shift was one of several moves that indicated that, whether or not Zuckerberg wanted to do this all along, Meta is positioning itself in sync with the new Trump administration. You’ve heard the litany, which has become a meme in itself. Meta promoted its top lobbyist, former GOP operative Joel Kaplan, to chief global affairs officer; he immediately appeared on Fox News (and only Fox News) to tout the new policies. Zuckerberg also announced that Meta would move employees who write and review content from California to Texas, to “help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content.” He disbanded Meta’s DEI program. (Where is Sheryl Sandberg, who was so proud of Meta’s diversity effort. Sheryl? Sheryl?) And Meta changed some of its service terms specifically to allow users to degrade LGBTQ people.\nNow that it’s been a week since Meta’s turnaround—and my first take at Zuckerberg’s speech—I am particularly haunted by one aspect: He seems to have downranked the basic practice of classic journalism, characterizing it as no better than the nonreported observations from podcasters, influencers, and countless random people on his platforms. This was hinted at in his Reel when he repeatedly used the term “legacy media” as a pejorative: a force that, in his view, urges censorship and stifles free expression. All this time I thought the opposite!\nA hint of his revised version of trustworthiness comes from the shift from fact-checkers to community notes. It’s true that the fact-checking process wasn’t working well—in part because Zuckerberg didn’t defend the checkers when ill-intentioned critics charged them with bias. It’s also reasonable to expect community notes to be a useful signal that a post might be fallacious. But the power of refutation fails when participants in the conversation reject the idea that disagreements can be resolved by convincing evidence. That’s a core difference between fact-checking—which Zuckerberg got rid of— and the community notes he’s implementing. The fact-checking worldview assumes that definitive facts, arrived at via research, talking to people, and sometimes even believing your own eyes, can be conclusive. The trick is recognizing authorities who have earned public confidence by pursuing truth. Community notes welcome alternate views—but judging which ones are reliable is all up to you. There’s something to the canard that an antidote to bad speech is more speech. But if verifiable facts can’t successfully refute easily disproven flapdoodle, we’re stuck in a suicidal quicksand of babel.\nThat’s the world that Donald Trump, Zuckerberg’s new role model, has consciously set about to realize. 60 Minutes reporter Leslie Stahl once asked Trump why he insulted reporters who were just doing their job. “You know why I do it?” he responded. “I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you.” In 2021, Trump further revealed his intent to benefit from an attack on truth. “If you say it enough and keep saying it, they’ll start to believe you,” he said during a rally. A corollary to that is if social media promotes falsehoods enough, people will believe those as well. Especially if formerly recognized authorities are discredited and demeaned.\nThat discrediting is exactly what Zuckerberg and his host Joe Rogan engaged in during a 3-hour conversation in Rogan’s Austin, Texas, podcast studio. This was Zuckerberg’s only appearance to explain his actions, another sign that he’s not kowtowing to a media establishment that he no longer feels is trustworthy or worth paying attention to. Zuckerberg and Rogan went on at length about how podcasters and influencers were more popular than mainstream reporters, because no one trusts those institutions anymore, and celebrated statistics that indicate that many people get their news from social media these days. (Though it’s still far from the dominant source.)\nLook, I am a fan of podcasts, especially the epic multi-hour interviews like Rogan’s. But as a replacement for reported news? That’s a disaster. Reporters make countless phone calls, dig through mountains of documents, and travel all over the globe to try to make sense of the world. Podcasters glean their knowledge from those reports—and maybe just as much from biased grifters, random anecdotes, and paranoid visions. Also, as interviewers, some podcasters are entertaining but not rigorous in posing tough questions. No wonder Zuckerberg chose Rogan as the single place to defend his decisions. Rogan didn’t challenge him on whether his decisions were a sop to the incoming president—he congratulated him.\nIn the same week that Rogan’s podcast dropped, Peter Thiel—the billionaire VC who led Facebook’s initial funding—published a piece in the Financial Times that resonated with the Zuckerberg/Rogan theory that the media shrouds things in darkness rather than sunlight. Thiel adopted a friend’s terminology to include the media in a sweeping conspiracy called The Distributed Idea-Suppression Complex that limits public discussion. He chortled that the internet, presumably under Trump’s influence, is helping “our liberation from the DISC prison.” (Somehow the Financial Times, which is as legacy as the media gets, escaped this prison to publish Thiel’s piece.)\nThiel’s examples of media suppression were a few cases where mainstream media–though not all of it– exercised perhaps too much caution, like the JFK assassination or, more recently, Covid. But on every single day, the thousands of journalists who still have jobs seek truth by gathering facts, whether it’s to locate a mayor’s nighttime peregrinations or to show how the FBI could have acted faster to stop a notorious swatter targeting high schools. Without facts, we cannot determine whether a cabinet nominee is worthy of a position, whether it’s proper to aid an ally, or why fighting fires in Southern California is so difficult. Of course I’m biased, but this seems rather obvious. The practice of journalism is already threatened by a post-internet failure of its traditional business models. What it didn’t see coming was a horrifyingly effective political attack on its very foundation.\nAnd now the guy who runs the biggest social networks in the world—and boasted on Rogan that because he can’t be fired, he will do anything he damn wants—has cast his lot with those who seek to tumble the distressingly vulnerable house of facts. Yes, it’s tough to control disinformation at scale. But Zuckerberg has accumulated over $200 billion of personal riches by building a platform that is part of the problem. He owes us something better than forcing his 3 billion users to sift out facts from lies, all while waving a checkered flag to the liars.\nZuckerberg knows better—after all, he let me collect facts on his company for three years. Afterwards, he messaged me congratulations. He didn’t agree with all my conclusions and said I didn’t get everything right (no examples), but he noted that he appreciated the time and effort I spent to produce a nuanced account. You know, what journalists do. On the Rogan show, Zuckerberg talked a lot about restoring masculinity to corporate culture. Maybe he should man up and fight for truth.\nTime Travel\nIn our 2018 interview, Zuckerberg was excited about building up the company’s content moderation forces and using AI to proactively take down content like hate speech and misinformation—a policy that he slammed the brakes on earlier this year. At the time, the company faced a crisis over its hosting of fake news during the 2016 election.\nBefore we wrap up I ask him—has this crisis made Facebook different?\nHis answer is both no—the mission is the same—but, in a way, yes. \"I really think the biggest shift is around being more proactive, around finding and preventing abuse. The big learning is that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility … It is no longer enough to give people tools to say what they want and then just let our community flag them and try to respond after the fact. We need to take a more active role in making sure that the tools aren't misused.\"\nZuckerberg recognizes the difficulty of remaking his systems to proactively catch harmful content. \"I think this is about a three-year transition to really build up the teams, because you can't just hire thirty thousand people overnight to go do something,” he says. \"You have to make sure that they're executing well and bring in the leadership and train them. And building up AI tools—that's not something that you could just snap your fingers on either … We'll never be fully done. But I do really think that this represents a pretty major shift in the overall business model and operating model of the company.\"\nAsk Me One Thing\nPetros asks, “Is AI model collapse similar to inbreeding?”\nThanks for the question, Petros. It's always tricky to anthropomorphize digital phenomena with actual biology. (This from a guy who wrote a book called Artificial Life.) But when you talk about AI model collapse, you are indeed referring to something that in the broadest sense can be understood by referencing a human condition. But let me back up for the uninitiated. We’ve seen the boom in AI large language models enabled by a massive influx of data to train them—basically as much human knowledge as can be input. So much that it looks like we’re running out of human-generated content to train the most recent generations of models.\nOne potential solution would be for the models themselves to create content—they can do this forever. But there are indications that if you do this a lot, it degrades the output. People have compared it to a snake eating its own tail. That’s why in the last few months I’ve seen the word ouroboros many times more than I have in my entire previous life. So in the same rough way that we talk about artificial neural nets as analogous to the networks in the brain, you can say that a collapse due to an overuse of synthetic data is like inbreeding.\nSome scientists think there’s a way around this. But I am just as happy that these limits exist. It puts a premium on quality human-created content—and incentivizes AI companies to pay for it.\nSubmit your questions in the comments below, or send an email to mail@wired.com.

    "content_text": "In olden times, people dug holes in the ground to look for gold. They called it mining. But why is gold valuable, anyway? Well, mostly because humans decided it was valuable. Yeah, but why gold? Well, one cool thing about element 79 is that it doesn't interact with the oxygen in the air, so it stays shiny all the time. Also, it's rare enough to be a status symbol. But really, money is just a social convention—we decide to make stuff worth other stuff.\nWhat about cryptocurrency? This is also made up by humans. You can “mine” crypto using a computer to do pointless, gnarly computations. These systems are usually set up so that it takes more computational power as more currency is mined, so the early coins are easily obtained and the later ones are more difficult. This also makes it like gold mining—after people find the easy stuff, you have to spend more to get more. But what happens when you use computers to solve massive problems? It's all about heat and energy. Real heat and energy.\nA Raspberry Pi Monero Miner\nTo really understand crypto mining, you sort of need to mine some crypto. So that’s what I did, using a tiny, cheap, single-board computer called a Raspberry Pi to mint Monero cryptocurrency. Yeah, this tiny setup is like digging for gold with a teaspoon, but it’s fine for studying the physics involved.\nOnce I get this beast of a machine running, I can take some measurements. In particular, I can determine the power it uses as well as the thermal output. In physics, power is the rate of energy change in units of watts (1 watt = 1 joule per second). For an electrical device, power can be calculated as the product of the input electrical current (I) and the voltage (ΔV):\nI know the Raspberry Pi runs at 5 volts, so I can just measure the electric current going into it to get the power. My meter registered a current of 0.62 amps, which gives a power of 3.1 watts. That’s 3.1 joules of energy used every second that it runs. But where does that energy go? Is there energy in cryptocurrency? No, it's all converted to thermal energy. Can we measure it? Yes we can.\nTo measure the thermal energy created, I put my Raspberry Pi in an insulated container with 1,000 milliliters of water. (Don't worry, the Pi was in a zip-lock bag so it wouldn't get wet.) Now I can measure the temperature of the water as crypto is mined. Here's the temperature as a function of time for a little over one hour of run time.\nAfter the first 20 minutes, the water temperature seemed to increase at a fairly constant rate of 0.0006 degrees Celsius per second. This increase in temperature means there is an increase in thermal energy, which we can calculate as:\nHere m is the mass of the stuff (in this case, water), and C is the specific heat capacity—the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of that substance by 1 degree Celsius. For water, C is 4.186 joules per gram per degree Celsius. So, with 1,000 ml of water and my rate of temperature change, I get that the water requires a power of 2.51 joules every second (or 2.51 watts).\nOh, look at that. Even with this rudimentary measurement system, this is pretty close to the power going into the Raspberry Pi. The difference is probably due to imperfect insulation. So you can see that the cryptocurrency power is just thermal energy. Honestly, I'm surprised it worked so well.\nShow Me the Money!\nAlthough it's possible to run a crypto miner as a way to warm your house, that's probably not why people do it. What’s the payoff? Well, let's do some quick calculations. I ran my Raspberry Pi miner for 12 hours. How much money did that produce? Wait for it … 0.00000006 XMR. Converting this to US dollars, it's 0.0012 cents (not dollars). Yes, this would be a slow way to amass a fortune. If I ran it for 12,000 hours, I still couldn’t buy a piece of chewing gum. Probably not even used chewing gum.\nAnd that’s not even accounting for the cost. I mean, mining isn't free—you have to pay for the electricity. The average cost of electricity in the US is 16.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. If I run my miner at 3 watts for 12 hours, that would be 24 watt-hours, or 0.024 KWh. Using the price of electricity, this would cost 0.41 cents. Let me just do some quick math here. Yup, 0.41 cents is more than the money I created. I'm no financial expert, but this seems like a bad business model.\nOf course, no one but a physicist would mine crypto on a Raspberry Pi. There are fancy mining machines (costing thousands of dollars) that let you mint coins faster and with less energy. The other thing to consider is the future price of a cryptocurrency. Even if the cost exceeds the reward today, maybe one day it could be worth much more. Finally, a crypto miner could be in a location with cheaper electricity. It's even possible to run a miner on solar.\nHowever, don't forget that for every joule of energy you put into a miner, you are going to produce 1 joule of thermal energy. You have to get rid of that heat, or it will cause problems for your computers. But cooling systems use more energy, and that can make it difficult to produce profitable currency.\nBut it must work, since there's quite a bit of mining in the US. In 2024, it was estimated that 2.3 percent of electrical energy went into cryptocurrency. That's quite a bit, and I'm really not sure it's the best use of our energy supply—especially since crypto is just a made-up thing.",

    "content_text": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\nSeverance, which imagines a world where a person’s work and personal lives are surgically separated, returns Friday for its long-awaited second season. While the concept of this gripping piece of science fiction is far-fetched, it touches on a question neuroscience has been trying to answer for decades: Can a person’s mind really be split in two?\nRemarkably, “split-brain” patients have existed since the 1940s. To control epilepsy symptoms, these patients underwent a surgery to separate the left and right hemispheres. Similar surgeries still happen today.\nLater research on this type of surgery showed that the separated hemispheres of split-brain patients could process information independently. This raises the uncomfortable possibility that the procedure creates two separate minds living in one brain.\nIn season one of Severance, Helly R (Britt Lower) experienced a conflict between her “innie” (the side of her mind that remembered her work life) and her “outie” (the side outside of work). Similarly, there is evidence of a conflict between the two hemispheres of real split-brain patients.\nWhen speaking with split-brain patients, you are usually communicating with the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls speech. However, some patients can communicate from their right hemisphere by writing, for example, or by arranging Scrabble letters.\nA young patient in one study was asked what job he would like in the future. His left hemisphere chose an office job making technical drawings. His right hemisphere, however, arranged letters to spell “automobile racer.”\nSplit-brain patients have also reported “alien hand syndrome,” where one of their hands is perceived to be moving of its own volition. These observations suggest that two separate conscious “people” may coexist in one brain and may have conflicting goals.\nIn Severance, however, both the innie and the outie have access to speech. This is one indicator that the fictional “severance procedure” must involve a more complex separation of the brain’s networks.\nAn example of a complex separation of function was described in the case report of Neil, in 1994. Neil was a teenage boy who had a number of difficulties following a pineal gland tumor. One of these difficulties was a rare form of amnesia. It meant that Neil could not recall the events of his day or report what he had learned in school. He had also become unable to read, although he could write, and he was unable to name objects, although he could draw them.\nAstonishingly, Neil was able to keep up with his education. Researchers became interested in how he was able to complete his schoolwork despite having no memory of what he was learning. They quizzed him about a novel he was studying at school, Cider With Rosie by Laurie Lee. In conversation, Neil could not remember anything about the book—not even the title. But when a researcher asked Neil to write down everything he could remember about the book, he wrote “Bloodshot Geranium windows Cider with Rosie Dranium smell of damp peppar [sic] and mushroom growth”—all words connected to the novel. As Neil could not read, he had to ask the researcher: “What did I write?”\nNeil was also able to write down other memories that were thought to be lost, including meeting a man with gangrene in a hospital. In each case, he was unaware of his own memory until he wrote it down and had it read back to him. Neil’s case is a staggering example. It suggests that it is possible to have rich memories that are inaccessible to our consciousness.\nIn Severance, Irving’s (John Turturro) outie can access memories of his innie’s work environment through painting. He paints the long hallways of the Severed floor (where his innie works), despite having no conscious memory of them. Perhaps then, in the show, the severance procedure involves blocking conscious access to memory in the same way that this access was blocked in Neil.\nWhich brain regions might be core to the TV show’s severance procedure? The region most associated with remembering the events of the work day is the hippocampus—and, interestingly, this same brain region also supports the representation of space.\nThe fact that the same neural structure supports both remembering that a new colleague just joined your team and representing the layout of the office suggests that the hippocampus might be a good target for this fictional procedure.\nIn Severance, the switch between innie and outie occurs at the boundary to the office—the elevator doors. This is reminiscent of “the doorway effect,” the phenomenon in which walking through a doorway makes you forget something.\nThe hippocampus segments our experience into episodes for later recall. Entering a new space is an indicator that a new episode has started, which leads to increased forgetting of information that spans these episodes. The effect is subtle, however. Although you might sometimes walk into the kitchen and forget why you went in, you don’t forget that you have children—unlike the dramatic effect caused by the show’s severance procedure. Perhaps, in Severance, the hippocampus’ interest in spatial boundaries triggers the switch between innie and outie.\nUnfortunately, there are two crucial flaws with the idea that the show’s severance procedure could involve a simple snip to the hippocampus.\nFirst, it’s not just episodic and spatial memory that is divided in Severance. The workers have a great deal of semantic knowledge (facts about Lumon, the company they work for, and its founder, for example) that is inaccessible to their outies. They also form emotional memories linked to the rewards they get for hard work and the punishments that they receive in the break room. These forms of memory rely on far more than the hippocampus, and the hippocampus itself is part of a brain-wide episodic memory network that is activated during episodic memory retrieval.\nThe second flaw is that memory itself is not an isolated process. It is closely connected to perception, attention, language, and many other processes. The human memory system is far too complex to be entirely split in two—but as Severance shows, it’s fun to think about the possibilities.",

    "content_text": "Observing the planets is one of the most awe-inspiring ways to witness the magic of the night sky—and there’s no better way to view them than in a planetary alignment. This is where multiple planets line up next to each other.\nOn January 21, six planets—Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—will be visible simultaneously in the sky, and their alignment will be easily visible from almost all parts of the globe. But if you miss the chance to observe the night sky on January 21, don’t worry: There is plenty of time to see this planetary parade.\nThe alignment will be visible for about a month, until mid to late February. The planets’ positions will, however, shift over this time, so their positions on January 21 will not be the same as their positions in late February.\nWhile conjunctions of two planets are somewhat common, alignments of five or more are quite rare. There will be two more planetary alignments featuring five or more planets this year, but after that, the next alignment of five or more planets won’t happen until 2040.\nHere’s everything you need to know to see this planetary alignment.\nHow to Watch\nTo get the best view, allow 20 to 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark. You’ll want to see this planetary alignment after the sun has set and from a location far away from artificial light, which makes it hard to see objects in the night sky.\nMars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, Saturn, and Venus will appear in an arc from east to west. You can spot four of these planets with your naked eyes; however, two of them—Uranus and Neptune—require a good pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope. Exactly where in the night sky to look for each planet on the 21st is outlined below, but if you’re not sure how to find them, don’t worry—apps like Stellarium can help you easily locate the planets and other celestial objects.\nWhen to Watch\nThe best time to view the planets is shortly after sunset, because three of them—Venus, Saturn, and Neptune—set between approximately 9 and 10:30 pm local time. Note that the exact time each planet rises and sets will vary slightly according to your location on Earth; you can use a website like Time and Date to find the exact timings for where you are.\nIt’s best to start skywatching earlier in the evening if you can, because Venus, Saturn, and Neptune will move lower toward the horizon before setting, and so will become more and more difficult to see as the evening goes on.\nMars\nOn January 21, Mars will be in the east, directly under the constellation Gemini. Mars has just reached opposition—meaning the Earth is directly between it and the sun—so the Red Planet will appear at its biggest and brightest and will be visible all night.\nMars is easily visible to the naked eye. But if you use a backyard telescope, you’ll be able to see its north polar ice cap, which spans more than 600 miles, and the Vallis Marineris, the largest canyon in the solar system, which runs along Mars’ equator and is over 1,800 miles long.\nJupiter\nJupiter will be to the west of Mars, in the constellation Taurus. Jupiter is easily visible to the naked eye. However, a pair of high-powered binoculars will allow you to see Jupiter’s moons and possibly its cloud bands.\nA backyard telescope will allow you to see the giant planet in even greater detail. Look for Jupiter’s cloud bands and its stunning Red Spot, an anticyclone that is over 10,000 miles wide—1.3 times the width of Earth. The Red Spot isn’t always visible from Earth, because Jupiter’s days are about 10 hours long, meaning the storm spends a sizable portion of time facing away from Earth on a lot of nights. You can use this calculator from Sky & Telescope to see when it might be visible from your location.\nJupiter will be visible for most of the night: It rises in the mid to late afternoon on January 21 and sets between about 3 and 5 am on January 22, depending on your exact location.\nUranus\nOn the 21st, Uranus will be about 50 degrees to the west of Jupiter and slightly below it. Uranus will appear to be near the Pleiades, a bright star cluster that is visible to the naked eye.\nYou will need a pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope to see Uranus, as it’s too dim to easily see with the naked eye. Through such equipment, Uranus looks like a star with a pale blue tint. Although Uranus has rings, they are too faint to see, even with viewing equipment. However, if you have a powerful backyard telescope, you could potentially see its moons.\nUranus rises in the early to mid afternoon and sets between approximately 2 and 3 am local time on January 21–22. The presence of moonlight makes this planet impossible to view, so plan on viewing Uranus before the moon rises (which will be at around midnight).\nNeptune\nVenus, Saturn, and Neptune will be clustered above the constellation Aquarius, near the western horizon. Neptune will be about 9 degrees above and slightly to the east of Venus (that’s roughly the size of a fist held at arm’s length).\nNeptune is only visible through a pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope. Through a pair of high-powered binoculars, Neptune looks like a star. Neptune also has rings, but those rings won’t be visible through amateur stargazing equipment.\nIf you have a very powerful backyard telescope and dark skies, you might be able to see Neptune’s largest moon, Triton. However, Triton will not be visible through most backyard telescopes.\nNeptune rises between about 9:30 and 10:30 am and sets between about 9:30 and 10:30 pm local time, so plan on viewing it shortly after sunset before it sinks low on the horizon.\nVenus and Saturn\nVenus and Saturn will be low in the sky toward the west. Both Venus and Saturn are easily visible to the naked eye—Venus is the second-brightest object in the night sky, second to the moon.\nVenus and Saturn will appear closest together on January 17–18, when they will be just 2 degrees apart in a conjunction. On the 21st, they will remain close together—about 3 degrees apart—so you probably will be able to see both of them together through the lenses of high-powered binoculars or a telescope.\nVenus is too bright for you to see any details on its surface; however, you can spot Saturn’s moons and rings through a pair of skywatching binoculars or a telescope.\nVenus and Saturn rise shortly before 10:30 am local time and set between 9:30 and 10:00 pm, so you’ll want to start skywatching earlier in the evening to see these planets before they vanish below the horizon.\nViewing Conditions\nOn January 21, the moon will be a waning gibbous—so about 52 percent illuminated. However, the moon will not rise until shortly after midnight local time, so it will not interfere with your ability to see the planetary alignment if you’re viewing shortly after sunset.\nViewing conditions will remain ideal throughout the rest of January (providing there isn’t cloud cover). The illuminated part of the moon will get smaller and smaller until the new moon on January 29, and the moon will rise after midnight and in the early morning hours throughout the rest of the month, creating the perfect opportunity for skywatching after sunset. However, viewing conditions will rapidly deteriorate in the first half of February, when the moon will be fuller and visible after sunset.",

You can spot four of these planets with your naked eyes; however, two of them—Uranus and Neptune—require a good pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope. Exactly where in the night sky to look for each planet on the 21st is outlined below, but if you’re not sure how to find them, don’t worry—apps like <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://stellarium-web.org/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://stellarium-web.org/\" href=\"https://stellarium-web.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stellarium</a> can help you easily locate the planets and other celestial objects.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">When to Watch</h2><p class=\"paywall\">The best time to view the planets is shortly after sunset, because three of them—Venus, Saturn, and Neptune—set between approximately 9 and 10:30 pm local time. Note that the exact time each planet rises and sets will vary slightly according to your location on Earth; you can use a website like <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/\" href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/night/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Time and Date</a> to find the exact timings for where you are.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It’s best to start skywatching earlier in the evening if you can, because Venus, Saturn, and Neptune will move lower toward the horizon before setting, and so will become more and more difficult to see as the evening goes on.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Mars</h2><p class=\"paywall\">On January 21, Mars will be in the east, directly under the constellation Gemini. Mars has just reached opposition—meaning the Earth is directly between it and the sun—so the Red Planet will appear at its biggest and brightest and will be visible all night.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Mars is easily visible to the naked eye. But if you use a backyard telescope, you’ll be able to see its <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/northern-ice-cap-of-mars/\">north polar ice cap, which spans more than 600 miles</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/valles-marineris-grand-canyon-of-mars/\">Vallis Marineris</a>, the largest canyon in the solar system, which runs along Mars’ equator and is over 1,800 miles long.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Jupiter</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Jupiter will be to the west of Mars, in the constellation Taurus. Jupiter is easily visible to the naked eye. However, a pair of high-powered binoculars will allow you to see Jupiter’s moons and possibly its cloud bands.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A backyard telescope will allow you to see the giant planet in even greater detail. Look for Jupiter’s cloud bands and its stunning Red Spot, an anticyclone that is <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/jupiters-great-red-spot-swallows-earth/#:~:text=wide%20as%20Earth.-,Measuring%20in%20at%2010%2C159%20miles%20(16%2C350%20kilometers)%20in%20width%20(,taken%20by%20astronomer%20Christopher%20Go.\">over 10,000 miles wide</a>—1.3 times the width of Earth. The Red Spot isn’t always visible from Earth, because <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/jupiter-facts/\">Jupiter’s days are about 10 hours long</a>, meaning the storm spends a sizable portion of time facing away from Earth on a lot of nights. You can use <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/interactive-sky-watching-tools/transit-times-of-jupiters-great-red-spot/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/interactive-sky-watching-tools/transit-times-of-jupiters-great-red-spot/\" href=\"https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/interactive-sky-watching-tools/transit-times-of-jupiters-great-red-spot/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this calculator from Sky &amp; Telescope</a> to see when it might be visible from your location.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Jupiter will be visible for most of the night: It rises in the mid to late afternoon on January 21 and sets between about 3 and 5 am on January 22, depending on your exact location.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Uranus</h2><p class=\"paywall\">On the 21st, Uranus will be about 50 degrees to the west of Jupiter and slightly below it. Uranus will appear to be near <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/science/explore-the-night-sky/hubble-messier-catalog/messier-45/\">the Pleiades</a>, a bright star cluster that is visible to the naked eye.</p><p class=\"paywall\">You will need a pair of high-powered binoculars or a backyard telescope to see Uranus, as it’s too dim to easily see with the naked eye. Through such equipment, Uranus looks like a star with a pale blue tint. Although Uranus has rings, they are too faint to see, even with viewing equipment. However, if you have a powerful backyard telescope, you could potentially see its moons.</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nMichael Lohscheller, the new CEO of Polestar, the Sweden-based, China-controlled electric car company, yesterday claimed in a strategic review that “2025 will be the best year in the [company’s] history.” That’s largely because, profitwise, 2024 wasn’t great for Polestar, 2023 could hardly be described as stellar, and 2022 was nothing to write home about. 2021 and prior? Sadly, more of the same.\nPolestar—which started life in 2005 as the brand name for a Volvo-tuning, gasoline-powered Swedish motorsports team, then transformed into an EV marque when Volvo bought the team 10 years later—has operated independently of Volvo since 2017, and it has yet to turn a profit. It sold 44,851 cars in 2024, 12,548 of these in Q3, and on the bottom line of that period, Polestar's $323 million net loss works out to the brand losing more than $25,740 for every EV it sold.\nIn yesterday’s review, Lohscheller claimed Polestar would grow sales by 30 to 35 percent in the coming three years, and he expects positive free cash flow “after investments” in 2027, which is two years later than the company’s previous break-even prediction.\nConfirmation of the Polestar 7, an EU-manufactured compact SUV to be produced (perhaps in Slovakia) in two years or so, wasn’t enough to calm Wall Street jitters, and shares slumped by 14 percent soon after the strategic review went online. Since going public in June 2022, Polestar’s US-listed shares have declined 90 percent.\nIn December, Polestar secured $800 million from several banks with 12-month terms, and it is seeking an additional loan of $400 million. Majority-owned by Chinese billionaire Li Shufu, founder and chair of Geely—which means “lucky” in Mandarin—Polestar has suffered delays in rolling out new models and seen increased competition in the marketplace.\n“Geely will continue to support Polestar’s development and strategy implementation, including working with Polestar to secure additional equity and debt funding,” Daniel Donghui Li, Geely’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.\n“We manufacture regionally for the different regions in the world, so [we have] to be protected and make sure that we don’t depend on sudden changes,” Lohscheller stressed in yesterday’s review. “There are more offers in the market, so it becomes much more competitive,” he admitted.\n“That's good for customers, because they have more choices, but for us it means there is more pricing pressure. We have to make sure that we have a cost-competitive product—and that’s exactly what we will do going forward. And that’s why the platform strategy is of highest importance, because efficiencies have to increase, and costs have to come down.”\nLohscheller, the former boss of Opel, has been in the job for just four months, replacing Thomas Ingenlath. More of a traditional finance-focused auto CEO than design-led Ingenlath, Lohscheller has been tasked with increasing sales, but this was made harder when, earlier this week, the outgoing Biden administration announced a ban on Chinese car sales.\n“We don’t want 2 million Chinese cars on the road and then realize … we have a threat,” said US commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, citing national security concerns. Late last year, Raimondo proposed a ban on Chinese automotive software starting in the 2027 model year, with a ban on Chinese-made hardware beginning in 2029.\nPolestar makes the Polestar 3 in a South Carolina factory, and last year warned that any sales ban “shuts down the operations of a lawfully organized US company with substantial US investments.”\n“The US is an important market for us,” Kim Palmer, Polestar head of PR, tells WIRED. Suggesting the speccing of non-Chinese software and other materials, Palmer adds: “We are in advanced stages to adapt our future models to make sure they comply with the regulation in terms of hardware, software, and suppliers.”\nNevertheless, Lohscheller may have to ask the Trump administration for dispensation to sell its US-manufactured cars in the US. Trump’s antipathy toward EVs is well known, but it’s unclear how much of America’s EV policy will be influenced by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n“It’s an unusual conflict of interest to see the CEO of Tesla in any way involved with EV policy for the entire country,” said Peter Wells, a business professor and director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff University in Wales, UK. “There’s an enormous potential for Musk to rewrite the rules to suit Tesla’s best interests.”\nIf this proves to be the case, it could be mighty hard for Polestar to get dispensation. Perhaps that’s why, in his presentation, Lohscheller stressed Polestar’s pivot into France. A trademark dispute with Citroen—the company claimed the Polestar logo was too similar to its own—previously prevented Polestar from selling in the French market.\nHowever, there’s a potential snafu. Would-be Polestar purchasers don’t yet qualify for France’s EV subsidy. “Polestar is not on the list of companies which have been approved by France to have qualified for their ecological bonus,” says Wells. “That’s not to say they couldn’t be on it in the future, but if they can’t get qualified for that scheme, they’ve got an incentive problem.”\nLochscheller said that 2024 had been a transition year for Polestar, and that now the company would revert to a more traditional dealership-based sales model.\n“A lot of things need to change,” said Lochscheller, “starting with sales and distribution. I call it from showing to active selling. The company has done a good job setting up the direct-to-consumer baseline, now the key task is making sure that the active selling through retail partners is improving.” More showrooms, then, and less reliance on online sales—old-school thinking.\n“Our [retail] footprint is growing,” said Lochscheller, citing the fact that there are now 25 Polestar showrooms in Sweden, 20 more than last year, and 20 showrooms in the UK, up from eight last year.\n“By expanding dealership sales, Polestar can reach more customers, thereby increasing overall sales volume,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, publisher of the Kelley Blue Book vehicle valuer, tells WIRED. “Customers are more likely to invest in a brand they can interact with and rely on,” she says.\nWells agrees: “Polestar, under new leadership, is now finally going to focus on being better at retail, and being better at bringing the revenues in. They’re going back to the traditional [automotive] sales model and presenting themselves to consumers in a less exotic way.”\nLochscheller, Wells says, is instilling in Polestar a “sense of conservatism, an attempt to cut costs, drive up volumes, adopt a more traditional marketing strategy, and generate enough revenue to survive.”\nPolestar cars are available in 27 countries. Production of the Polestar 4 will start in South Korea in the second half of 2025. Polestar 5, a Porsche Taycan-rivaling GT, is due to go on sale later this year and is built on the brand’s first bespoke EV architecture. The proposed Polestar 7 could do well in the US, claims Streaty. “Developing a vehicle in the premium compact SUV segment is a smart move,” she says.\nWith break-even still at least two years away, Polestar will likely need additional financing to see it through to profitability. But Polestar—reliant on support from its ultimate Chinese owner—may not have two years, claims Wells. “The Chinese EV market is booming, but there’s lots of competition, with rampant price cutting. The risk for Polestar is that their financial support may not last. Polestar might become an extravagance too far for Geely. Market conditions are moving faster than company strategic plans.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThere still might be some deus ex machina that saves TikTok—or at least puts things on hold—but for now the imminent ban on the social media app has been upheld by the US Supreme Court.\nSo what about all those videos you’ve posted ? They might be vacation vlogs, scathing reaction videos, or just lighthearted memes, but you likely worked hard on them, and it would be a shame to lose them.\nJust to be clear, under the terms of the ban, existing users will still be able to use TikTok; you just won’t get software updates. So if you want to download those videos for safekeeping, you’re not necessarily under the gun to get it done by Sunday. Then again, TikTok’s lawyer told the court it would “go dark” on Sunday if the ban were not overturned … No one knows what that means.\nYou should be able to download any video you’ve published to the platform. You can also download other creators’ videos if they’ve made the videos public and enabled the privacy setting that lets other users download their clips. If you follow our steps below and don’t see the option to save locally, it’s likely the creator has restricted the sharing permissions.\nIf you’re a creator who wants to back up your own clips, or you just want to hoard your all-time TikTok faves, here’s how.\nJanuary 2025: This article was updated to reflect current information and details about downloading TikTok videos.\nSave TikTok Videos to Your Phone\nFor most people, TikTok is a purely mobile experience: They watch, create, and post videos entirely with their phones. If you’re a mobile-first TikTok creator, then the videos you’ve shot may already be saved somewhere on your phone. But maybe you’ve switched phones, or you’ve deleted local copies of those old videos to free up space. If your videos are only stored in TikTok’s cloud, you can still likely download all of them onto your phone.\nIt’s a bit easier to download videos onto a computer than it is to get them onto your phone. There are a few extra steps on mobile, so if you have dozens or even hundreds of videos to back up, maybe follow the instructions listed further down that explain how to get the videos onto your computer instead.\nHere are the instructions for iPhones and Android devices:\nGo to any TikTok video. On your own videos, tap the three dots in the lower-right corner of the screen. For videos by other creators that are available to download, tap the arrow-shaped Share button in the same area.\nA series of gray icons will appear along the bottom of the screen. Tap the one that says Save Video.\nA percentage counter will appear onscreen, indicating that the app is processing the video. This usually goes very quickly, so you might not even see it, but that depends on the speed of your connection.\nNext, an array of sharing options pop up. Scroll to the right and click the three dots. Here, you can choose the email option to send the file to yourself as an attachment, or upload it to a cloud service like Google Drive. There will be even more options based on your smartphone’s apps. Look for any options that allow you to save the video locally.\nOn Android, the best option for saving a video to your phone will be labeled Files by Google. Tap this icon to download the video to your phone, then use Android’s built-in Files app to browse your downloads. On iOS, look for the option Save to Files, then choose to save the video either in your device’s internal storage or in your iCloud drive.\nDownload TikTok Videos to Your Computer\nThe simplest option for collecting your work is to download the videos from TikTok’s website or desktop app. This process is very easy compared to the mobile option.\nGo to your favorite video on TikTok.com and right-click on it. If you’re looking at your own video and you’re logged in to your account, or if the video’s creator has marked their posts as downloadable, there will be an option in the right-click menu that says Download Video.\nClick that option.\nCongrats, you’ve done it! The video will be saved as an MP4 in your downloads folder.\nIf you don’t see the option to download the video when you right-click, that probably means the creator hasn’t shared the video publicly or has chosen to disallow downloads.\nUse Screen Record\nIt’s not the tidiest option, but you can also record a copy of the video via screen record on your phone. Screen record basically takes a video screenshot; once turned on, it will record whatever is playing on your screen until you hit Stop. Play the TikTok clip while screen recording and you’ll have a quick-and-dirty copy saved to your device.\nYou’ll need to play the video all the way through in real time. Keep in mind that this will capture everything that happens on the screen while you’re recording, so if a notification pops up or you swipe to another app, that will all be in the video. It also means you’ll still see all the menu buttons and text that are normally around the edges of the screen in a TikTok video, so it won’t be a perfectly clean copy, nor the best quality, but it may be better than nothing.\nYou can record your screen on iOS and on Android phones with Android 11 or higher.\nTo do this on iOS 18, first swipe down from the top right of your screen to access the Control Center. If you already see a gray circle with a white dot icon there, this is what you need to tap to start recording. If you don't, click and hold a blank space to edit your controls. Click Add a Control, and find it manually or search for it.\nOn older versions of iOS, you will have to do this slightly different, by heading to Settings > Control Center and pressing the + icon next to Screen Recording.\nFor Android users, swipe down from the top of your screen to bring up your notifications and settings screen. From there, you might have to expand the menu at top and swipe through your settings widgets. Look for Screen Record. Tap that and you’ll have options to record device audio as well as whether to show touches on the screen. Tap Start to record.\nWhat’s With the Watermark?\nIf you’ve downloaded your videos, you probably noticed the faint TikTok watermark in the frame. This watermark will appear in any videos you’ve published as well as in videos you download from other creators. Unfortunately, there’s no official way to download a video directly from the platform after it’s been posted without that watermark being applied. If a video is still in your drafts in the TikTok app—meaning you’ve shot and edited it but not posted it yet—you can select the Save Video option and download a version of it without the watermark.\nIn general, if you’re creating videos, your best bet is to use a separate video editing app to edit your video before posting it online. That way you’ll always have the original cut and not have to worry about whether your distribution platform—and all your hard work—is about to suddenly go poof.",

It also means you’ll still see all the menu buttons and text that are normally around the edges of the screen in a TikTok video, so it won’t be a perfectly clean copy, nor the best quality, but it may be better than nothing.</p><p class=\"paywall\">You can record your screen on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/ios/\">iOS</a> and on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/android/\">Android</a> phones with Android 11 or higher.</p><p class=\"paywall\">To do this on <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935\" href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a> 18, first swipe down from the top right of your screen to access the <strong>Control Center.</strong> If you already see a gray circle with a white dot icon there, this is what you need to tap to start recording. If you don't, click and hold a blank space to edit your controls. Click <strong>Add a Control</strong>, and find it manually or search for it.</p><p class=\"paywall\">On older versions of iOS, you will have to do this slightly different, by heading to <strong>Settings &gt; Control Center</strong> and pressing the + icon next to <strong>Screen Recording</strong>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">For <a href=\"https://support.google.com/android/answer/9075928?hl=en\">Android</a> users, swipe down from the top of your screen to bring up your notifications and settings screen. From there, you might have to expand the menu at top and swipe through your settings widgets. Look for <strong>Screen Record</strong>. Tap that and you’ll have options to record device audio as well as whether to show touches on the screen. Tap Start to record.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">What’s With the Watermark?</h2><p class=\"paywall\">If you’ve downloaded your videos, you probably noticed the faint TikTok watermark in the frame. This watermark will appear in any videos you’ve published as well as in videos you download from other creators. Unfortunately, there’s no official way to download a video directly from the platform after it’s been posted without that watermark being applied. If a video is still in your drafts in the TikTok app—meaning you’ve shot and edited it but not posted it yet—you can select the Save Video option and download a version of it without the watermark.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In general, if you’re <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-upgrade-youtube-recording-setup/\">creating videos</a>, your best bet is to use a separate video editing app to edit your video before posting it online. That way you’ll always have the original cut and not have to worry about whether your distribution platform—and all your hard work—is about to suddenly go poof.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "The Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu—better known internationally as RedNote—is scrambling to boost its ability to moderate English-language content after hundreds of thousands of American users suddenly joined the platform in anticipation of TikTok potentially being banned in the United States on Sunday.\nWIRED identified a handful of job listings posted to recruitment platforms by tech outsourcing companies in China this week for content moderators who can help manage the unexpected influx of English videos and posts being uploaded to Xiaohongshu. (There were also several new recruitment notices posted looking for content moderators who can work in Chinese, the platform’s default language.)\nVXI Global Solutions, an American customer service company that has operated in China since the early 2000s, posted job vacancies on the recruitment websites Zhilian Zhaopin and BOSS Zhipin, specifying that candidates would be “moderating the videos by accounts of foreign friends on Xiaohongshu.” The recruiter even labeled one of the listings “Xiaohongshu overnight urgent recruitment—TikTok refugee moderation, short-term [contracts] accepted.”\nJinhui Rongzhi Technology, an IT service outsourcing company, and Transn, an AI-powered translation service provider, also posted similar recruitment notices this week looking for English-speaking content moderators to work for Xiaohongshu. WIRED contacted the three companies to confirm the validity of the listings. None of them responded in time for publication. Xiaohongshu also did not immediately return a request for comment.\nThe salary for the jobs range from 4,500 RMB to 8,000 RMB a month (about $600 to $1,100). Applicants are required to demonstrate their English language skills and prove they passed a proficiency exam. One listing noted that the position must be filled within three days, and candidates need not apply if they can’t start immediately.\nChina’s Cyberspace Administration, the country’s top internet watchdog, has reportedly already grown concerned about content being shared by foreigners on Xiaohongshu. CAC warned the platform earlier this week to “ensure China-based users can’t see posts from US users,” according to The Information.\nSocial media platforms in China are legally required to remove a wide range of content, including nudity and graphic violence, but especially information that the government deems politically sensitive. Platforms like Xiaohongshu rely on large teams of contractors managed by outsourcing companies to do both routine enforcement as well as respond to emergency situations.\n“RedNote—like all platforms owned by Chinese companies—is subject to the Chinese Communist Party’s repressive laws,” wrote Allie Funk, research director for technology and democracy at the nonprofit human rights organization Freedom House, in an email to WIRED. “Independent researchers have documented how keywords deemed sensitive to those in power, such as discussion of labor strikes or criticism of Xi Jinping, can be scrubbed from the platform.”\nBut the influx of American TikTok users—as many as 700,000 in merely two days, according to Reuters—could be stretching Xiaohongshu’s content moderation abilities thin, says Eric Liu, an editor at China Digital Times, a California-based publication documenting censorship in China, who also used to work as a content moderator himself for the Chinese social media platform Weibo.\nLiu said it’s nearly impossible for Xiaohongshu to quickly recruit so many moderators who speak English. “Content moderation isn’t something you can just do through translation tools. It’s a very sophisticated job,” that “requires the person to speak the relevant languages.”\nLiu reposted a screenshot on Bluesky showing that some people who recently joined Xiaohongshu have received notifications that their posts can only be shown to other users after 48 hours, seemingly giving the company time to determine whether they may be violating any of the platform’s rules. This is a sign that Xiaohongshu’s moderation teams are unable to react swiftly, Liu says.\nChina Digital Times previously published a 2020 internal instruction manual for Xiaohongshu content moderators that explained how they should respond to “sudden incidents.” Liu notes that Xiaohongshu is not an app commonly used for political discussions, but nevertheless, the manual shows that moderators were told to be prepared for any accidental political content users might share. Regarding the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, the document asks that moderators be careful to ensure that travel photos from the city don’t include landmarks like the Pillar of Shame, which commemorated lives lost in the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, or depict demonstrators on the streets, Liu says.\nAs in other parts of the world, content moderation is one of the most tedious and low-paying jobs in China’s tech industry. Social media platforms often outsource the role to companies that hire moderators on a contract basis, allowing tech giants to avoid providing the same benefits to these workers as they do to full-time employees.\nWhile the majority of the new TikTok refugees still appear to be enjoying their time on Xiaohongshu, some have already had their posts censored. Christine Lu, a Taiwanese-American tech entrepreneur who created a Xiaohongshu account on Wednesday, says she was suspended after uploading three provocative posts about Tiananmen, Tibet, and Taiwan. “I support more [Chinese and American] people engaging directly. But also, knowing China, I knew it wouldn’t last for long,” Lu tells WIRED.\nThe fact that Americans are now flocking to a domestic Chinese social media platform that blatantly removes content deemed unacceptable by the Chinese government demonstrates the ineffectiveness of trying to ban a single app like TikTok in the first place, says Funk. “A more sustainable approach to dealing with the potential risks presented by TikTok, RedNote, or any Chinese-owned app is passing legislation that strengthens data privacy and cybersecurity and requires social media platforms to operate with more transparency,” she says.",

    "content_text": "A crypto investor has brought a class action lawsuit against Pump.Fun, a platform for launching and investing in meme-inspired cryptocurrencies, after suffering trading losses.\nRepresenting the plaintiffs are Wolf Popper and Burwick Law, the two firms handling a separate class action brought by investors in December over a memecoin launched by web personality Haliey Welch, better known as the Hawk Tuah girl, which collapsed in value soon after trading began. (Welch was not named as a defendant in that suit.)\n“These ‘emperor’s new clothes’ crypto schemes can’t keep masquerading as legitimate finance, leaving the vulnerable in the lurch,\" says Max Burwick, founding partner at Burwick Law.\nPump.Fun was a hit when launched in January 2024, giving people a way to launch memecoins—highly volatile cryptocurrencies that typically have no inherent purpose beyond speculation—instantly and at no cost. The new lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Southern District of New York, alleges that Pump.Fun has operated as an unregistered securities issuer and seller. In making marketing claims that downplay the likelihood of losing money trading memecoins, the complaint alleges, the platform also put investors at heightened financial risk.\nSeparately, the lawsuit alleges that these memecoin platforms, like Pump.Fun, are designed in such a way as to incentivize pump-and-dump activity. “Early investors or insiders artificially inflate token prices through coordinated buying and promotional campaigns, then sell their holdings at peak prices, causing the token's value to collapse and leaving later investors with substantial losses,” the complaint claims.\nThe complaint points to the circumstances around the launch of a particular Pump.Fun memecoin—PNUT, which references the celebrity squirrel euthanized last year in New York—to evidence its claims.\nPump.Fun did not respond to a request for comment. But in an interview with WIRED last year, Noah Tweedale, one of the three Pump.Fun cofounders named in the suit, refuted the idea that the platform stands to benefit from regular investors losing money. “The idea with Pump was to build something where everyone was on the same playing field,” Tweedale said. “I want to stress, we don’t want people to lose money on our platform. It doesn’t benefit us by any means.”\nMore than 6 million unique memecoins have been launched through Pump.Fun, the most successful of which are valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. The memecoin market is now worth in excess of $100 billion in aggregate, market data shows.\nIn its first 12 months in operation, Pump.Fun is reported by third parties to have generated more than $350 million in revenue, taking a 1 percent cut of trades. The platform is on pace to make more than $1 billion in revenue in 2025.\nHowever, the lawsuit brought by the crypto investor—which follows reports of unethical trading activity, criticism relating to content moderation, and a warning issued against Pump.Fun by the UK financial regulator—could threaten to put a dampener on the runaway growth.\nThe lawsuit hinges on the idea that memecoins should in some circumstances be classified as securities, a particular type of investment instrument. The complaint claims that by failing to register token sales with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the relevant US financial regulator, Pump.Fun allegedly violated securities laws and denied investors the disclosures required of regulated entities.\nWhether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities is a long-running debate that has spawned a mess of litigation between the SEC and cryptocurrency companies. Though the SEC has not pursued many memecoin-related cases to date, in the lawsuit against Pump.Fun, the crypto investor alleges that all memecoins issued through the platform resemble securities by virtue of the way they are marketed.\n“This largely turns on the question of an expectation of returns through marketing promises,” says Burwick. “The issue with almost every memecoin is: How was this marketed?” Essentially, if a creator or issuing platform suggests that a coin is headed to the moon, Burwick believes it is a security.\nIn the interview with WIRED, Tweedale rejected the idea that memecoins might fall under the purview of the SEC. “Memecoins being securities is a joke. That can’t be the case,” he said.\nElsewhere, the lawsuit alleges that Pump.Fun essentially gamified the trading experience and engaged in a \"sophisticated marketing campaign\" that combined \"promises of exponential returns, luxury lifestyle imagery, and coordinated social media promotion,” which had the effect of obfuscating the risk profile of memecoin investing.\nThe architecture of the Pump.Fun platform, which relies upon a mathematical mechanism known as a bonding curve to eliminate the cost of issuing a memecoin for creators, amplifies the potential financial harm by creating a dynamic whereby early buyers benefit disproportionately, the investor has alleged.\nMeanwhile, in failing to verify the age or identity of its users, Pump.Fun exposes minors and inexperienced investors to both financial risk and the explicit material rife on the platform, the complaint alleges. In December, Tweedale told WIRED that Pump.Fun plans to introduce age restrictions but provided no further specifics.\nMemecoin trading has frequently been compared to gambling at a casino. But the metaphor is ill-fitting, Burwick claims, because it erases the responsibility to investors that should be borne by the platforms through which memecoins are issued.\n“This is not a casino … Retail investors are sold an opportunity to make a return on their investment, but the reality is that they have an entire system they are playing against. They don’t understand how heavily the odds are stacked against them,” says Burwick. “Pump.Fun is not gambling—it’s the illegal issuance of securities.”",

A document seen and first reported by Bloomberg indicates that the bureau has been scrambling to mitigate any potential fallout that could lead to revelations about the identities of anonymous sources connected to investigations.\nThe breached data didn't include the content of calls and texts, but Bloomberg reports that it would have shown communication logs for agents' mobile numbers and other phone numbers they used during the six months period. It is unclear how widely the stolen data has spread, if at all. WIRED reported in July that after the hackers attempted to extort AT&T, the company paid $370,000 in an attempt to have the data trove deleted. In December, US investigators charged and arrested a suspect who reportedly was behind the entity that threatened to leak the stolen data.\nThe FBI tells WIRED in a statement: “The FBI continually adapts our operational and security practices as physical and digital threats evolve. The FBI has a solemn responsibility to protect the identity and safety of confidential human sources, who provide information every day that keeps the American people safe, often at risk to themselves.”\nAT&T spokesperson Alex Byers says in a statement that the company “worked closely with law enforcement to mitigate impact to government operations” and appreciates the “thorough investigation” they conducted. “Given the increasing threat from cybercriminals and nation-state actors, we continue to increase investments in security as well as monitor and remediate our networks,” Byers adds.\nThe situation is surfacing amid ongoing revelations about a different hacking campaign perpetrated by China's Salt Typhoon espionage group, which compromised a slew of US telecoms, including AT&T. This separate situation exposed call and text logs for a smaller group of specific high-profile targets, and in some cases included recordings as well as information like location data.\nAs the US government has scrambled to respond, one recommendation from the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been for Americans to use end-to-end encrypted platforms—like Signal or WhatsApp—to communicate. Signal in particular stores almost no metadata about its customers and would not reveal which accounts have communicated with each other if it were breached. The suggestion was sound advice from a privacy perspective, but was very surprising given the US Justice Department's historic opposition to the use of end-to-end encryption. If the FBI has been grappling with the possibility that its own informants may have been exposed by a recent telecom breach, though, the about-face makes more sense.\nIf agents were following protocol for investigative communications strictly, though, the stolen AT&T call and text logs shouldn't pose a big threat, says former NSA hacker and Hunter Strategy vice president of research Jake Williams. Standard operating procedure should be designed to account for the possibility that call logs could be compromised, he says, and should require agents to communicate with sensitive sources using phone numbers that have never been linked to them or the US government. The FBI could be warning about the AT&T breach out of an abundance of caution, Williams says, or it may have discovered that agents' mistakes and protocol errors were captured in the stolen data. “This wouldn't be a counterintelligence issue unless someone was not following procedure,” he says.\nWilliams adds, too, that while the Salt Typhoon campaigns are only known to have impacted a relatively small group of people, they affected many telecoms, and the full impact of those breaches still may not be known.\n“I worry about the FBI sources who might have been affected by this AT&T exposure, but more broadly the public still doesn't have a full understanding of the fallout of the Salt Typhoon campaigns,” Williams says. “And it seems that the US government is still working on getting a grasp of that as well.”",

    "content_text": "Jonathan Lachman, the previous head of special projects at OpenAI, recently left to join a new artificial intelligence research lab founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, according to two people familiar with the discussions. It’s the most high-profile hire Murati has made since leaving OpenAI in September last year to start the much-hyped venture, which is focused on the exploration of so-called artificial general intelligence.\nMurati has poached roughly 10 researchers and engineers in total so far from competitors including OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind. Her startup is still in its early stages—it doesn’t have a name, nor a firm product direction, according to two people familiar with the company.\nMurati and Lachman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed Lachman’s departure.\nMurati departed OpenAI less than a year after CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the company’s board of directors in late 2023. In the turmoil that followed, the board briefly appointed Murati, who then served as the company’s chief technology officer, as interim CEO.\nThe move was a blow to Altman. “I was like, that feels really bad,” he told podcaster Lex Fridman last March. He described Murati’s promotion as “the low point” of the dramatic leadership crisis that briefly consumed OpenAI. Less than a week later and after more than 730 OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Altman was reinstated as CEO.\nAltman and Murati continued to work closely together at OpenAI after the incident. “She did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos,” Altman told Fridman on the podcast. When Murati stepped down from the company 10 months later, she thanked Altman in her goodbye letter.\n“There’s never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes,” she wrote in the note to OpenAI employees, which she later posted on X. She added that she was “stepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.” A month later, Reuters reported that Murati was trying to raise over $100 million to fund a mysterious new company, though that figure had not been finalized.\nOpenAI’s vice president of research, Barret Zoph, and chief research officer, Bob McGrew, both left around the same time as Murati. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and chief scientist, followed suit in May of last year. He went on to found Safe Superintelligence, a startup focused on AI safety. Within three months, Sutskever’s startup had raised $1 billion. Anthropic, a major OpenAI competitor, was also founded by former OpenAI executives and has raised billions of dollars in funding, including $8 billion from Amazon.",

    "content_text": "As the rate of humanity’s data creation increases exponentially with the rise of AI, scientists have been interested in DNA as a way to store digital information. After all, DNA is nature’s way of storing data. It encodes genetic information and determines the blueprint of every living thing on earth.\nAnd DNA is at least 1,000 times more compact than solid-state hard drives. To demonstrate just how compact, researchers have previously encoded all of Shakespeare’s 154 sonnets, 52 pages of Mozart’s music, and an episode of the Netflix show “Biohackers” into tiny amounts of DNA.\nBut these were research projects or media stunts. DNA data storage isn’t exactly mainstream yet, but it might be getting closer. Now you can buy what may be the first commercially available book written in DNA. Today, Asimov Press debuted an anthology of biotechnology essays and science fiction stories encoded in strands of DNA. For $60, you can get a physical copy of the book plus the nucleic acid version—a metal capsule filled with dried DNA.\nTo encode the book in DNA, Asimov Press worked with Boston-based company Catalog, which created approximately 500,000 unique DNA molecules to encode the 240 pages in the book, representing 481,280 bytes of data.\nTraditional DNA data storage works by converting a digital file’s binary code of 0s and 1s into As, Cs, Gs, and Ts—the building blocks of DNA. Custom DNA strands are chemically synthesized letter by letter to match the desired sequence.\nCatalog instead uses a method called combinatorial assembly, which the company likens to the Gutenberg printing press. Similar to how movable letters can be arranged to form words, Catalog created an alphabet of DNA pieces that can be assembled to represent bits. The company manufactures those DNA snippets en masse and then uses enzymes to encode information into them. David Turek, Catalog’s chief technology officer, said it cost in the low thousands of dollars to encode the book in DNA and make 1,000 copies.\n“This is a case where you encode something in DNA once and you can make as many replicas as you want using the tools of molecular biology,” he says. “It’s fairly easy to do this in volume.”\nIn 2023, French company Biomemory started offering a $1,000 DNA storage card that allows customers to store roughly one kilobyte of data, equivalent to a short email, of their choosing. At the time, CEO Erfane Arwani told WIRED that the offering was an experiment to gauge consumer interest in DNA data storage. “We wanted to demonstrate that our process is ready to be shown to the world,” he said.\nThe cards were pricey, though, because synthesizing DNA is still a fairly slow and costly process. Catalog claims its combinatorial approach is more efficient. Making identical copies of the same book also drove the price down.\nAfter Catalog did the encoding, the DNA molecules were dried into a powder and shipped to France, where biological storage firm Imagene packaged the molecules into stainless steel capsules with an inert internal atmosphere, meaning there is no oxygen or moisture inside. In this state, the DNA inside can be preserved for thousands of years.\nData stored in DNA is “read” with a sequencing machine, which determines the order of those As, Cs, Gs, and Ts. San Francisco–based sequencing company Plasmidsaurus was tapped to do this decoding, and the DNA sequence is available to customers that purchase the book.\n“So often, biotechnology is hidden, kind of behind the curtains,” says Niko McCarty, founding editor of Asimov Press. He and editor-in-chief Xander Balwit conceived of the DNA book project because they “wanted people to feel biotechnology.” He says Asimov Press has sold nearly 500 preorders so far.\nThe ability to put a capsule full of DNA on a shelf or in a drawer and forget about it is a major part of its appeal as a storage medium. Turek says DNA could potentially replace sprawling, energy-guzzling data centers. Unlike storing data on servers, which requires constant energy use, DNA can sit on a shelf for years without needing energy until that data is retrieved. Of course, it means DNA isn’t the ideal medium for storing data that’s accessed often. But researchers imagine that it could be an ideal way to preserve large amounts of archival data.\n“This is going to be a technology that really attacks the energy problem quite head on,” Turek says.",

    "content_text": "Finally—after years of rumors and months of leaks, Nintendo has confirmed the biggest open secret in gaming: The Switch 2 is releasing this year.\nThe announcement doesn’t come as a surprise—especially in the wake of CES 2025, where several peripheral makers were bold enough to display replicas of the unrevealed hardware to showcase their Switch 2 accessories—but you might be shocked at just how closely the upcoming Switch 2 sticks to the form and function of its predecessor.\nAt a glance, the reveal video shows a … slightly bigger Switch. It's still a hybrid console, alternating between a portable handheld gaming device and a home entertainment system that outputs to your big-screen TV via a docking station. It still has a pair of detachable Joy-Con controllers that seem to still function as two independent controllers for the ever-present, on-the-go multiplayer. It runs Mario Kart! For all intents and purposes, this is Switch 2: Switch Harder.\nIn an industry where generational leaps are usually accompanied by the breathless espousing of new features and ever more powerful hardware, the Switch 2 reveal feels oddly restrained. Even the Sony PlayStation 5 Pro, a mid-generation upgrade, had more hype surrounding its announcement. Nintendo has rarely played that game though—arguably the last time it did was way back in the SNES era, where it boasted of the 16-bit console’s “Mode 7” graphics prowess over the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive—here in 2025, it doesn't need to. The reason is simple: The existing Switch is already a market leader, so why change what works?\nIt's hard to overstate the impact the Switch has had on the gaming industry since its launch in 2017. Not only has it become one of the best-selling consoles of all time—146.2 million units sold globally as of September 2024, putting it behind only the PlayStation 2 and the Nintendo DS handheld, though it may overtake even those by the end of its life cycle—but it's almost single-handedly driven the renewed surge in gaming handhelds.\nThe launch of Valve's Steam Deck in 2022 was the biggest reaction to the success of the Switch, and its became an immediate hit, allowing players to take their bulging (and often untouched) Steam libraries with them. Like the Switch, the Steam Deck supported docked output to a TV, either through Valve's peripheral or one made by various third-party manufacturers. From Steam Deck, we saw the arrival of rival handheld gaming PCs, from Lenovo's Legion Go to Asus’ ROG Ally X or MSI's Claw, with more on the way.\nEven Microsoft is planning some sort of handheld Xbox, which would see it entering a corner of the gaming industry it has never dabbled in, even though the company's gaming boss, Phil Spencer, says such a gadget is likely years away. Sony, meanwhile, already twice-burned with gaming handhelds in the form of the PSP and PS Vita, was so surprised by the popularity of its PS Portal device—launched as a “remote viewer” accessory for PS5—that it keeps updating it to add more dedicated gaming features (even if those ambitions aren't quite panning out just yet).\nWhile almost all of these devices have considerably more power than the now-aged Nintendo Switch, they all emerged in response to Nintendo tapping into a gamer's desire for home console-quality gaming on the go. None of them have replicated the simplicity of being able to seamlessly transition between home and portable play.\nBesides, the futility of endlessly chasing higher specs and bigger numbers is something industry figures have been quietly acknowledging since the launch of the original Switch. As far back as 2020, former Xbox marketing lead Albert Penello said hardware refreshes were “less necessary,” while Spencer told Bloomberg, “We're not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles.\"\nPower and specs be damned—everyone else is playing catch-up to the experience the Switch delivers, so why should Nintendo change what works for the Switch 2?\nSwitching It Up\nThat's not to say the Switch 2 won't offer any improvements over the Switch 1. Although Nintendo hasn't confirmed any specifications yet—don't expect those details until the dedicated Nintendo Direct broadcast on April 2—a few things are immediately apparent from the reveal.\nMost prominent is the aesthetic change—the Switch 2 is nearly all black, with only color highlights for the Joy-Con controllers. Those highlights keep the iconic red/blue split of the original Switch, but overall the new hardware has a less toylike, more grown-up appearance.\nNext are the overhauled Joy-Con controllers themselves. In addition to being slightly bigger to match the larger screen—a design choice sure to be welcomed by anyone whose hands have cramped up trying to use an existing Joy-Con as a single controller—they now snap into a recessed bracket in the main console rather than sliding into place as with the current Switch. This appears to lend credence to long-running rumors that the new controller grips would utilize a magnetic connection to hold them in place.\nOther redesigned Joy-Con elements include more prominent shoulder triggers for use when connected to the console and the addition of an inward-facing trigger that looks tricky to reach in console mode but may function independently when detached. Meanwhile, the (presumably) magnetic connection affords a raised row with integrated miniature shoulder buttons. There also seems to be some new sensor integrated here, which may prove to offer rumored mouselike features for the Joy-Cons. A couple of shots of both Joy-Cons sliding around a flat surface also point in this direction—and if so, could a Switch keyboard be far behind?\nWe also see an extra button on the face of the right-hand Joy-Con, beneath the Home button. While this is unlabeled in the teaser, it could see some form of “C-button” functionality, which Nintendo used in various forms on the N64 and GameCube in the past. It's also worth noting one particularly pointed shot focused on the left Joy-Con thumbstick rotating—could this be intended to highlight improved thumbsticks for the new generation, possibly incorporating Hall effect technology? Given the drift issues that plagued the original Switch, it'd be a smart move on Nintendo's part.\nThe biggest changes to the main console itself, beyond the increased physical size, are the addition of an extra USB-C port on the top and a new U-shaped kickstand. While the former is an excellent addition, opening up the potential to support more accessories, the latter looks a little flimsy—better than the nub that propped up the original Switch but less sturdy than the Switch OLED’s solid back-panel kickstand.\nSpeaking of the OLED Switch, and judging purely from the chunky bezel shown in the Switch 2 reveal, the new console may be reverting to an LCD panel. Again, this has been rumored for a while, but it will be hard not to see it as a bit of a step backward.\nThe best takeaway from the reveal, though, is Nintendo immediately confirming backward compatibility with existing Switch games, both physically and digitally (albeit with a few as-yet -unspecified exclusions). That's fantastic news for players who've spent the better part of a decade building up their libraries, and another example of Nintendo's quiet confidence and sense of continuity. When you've racked up 1.3 billion software sales for your incredibly successful platform, why risk alienating those customers?\nAnd that's seemingly Nintendo's strategy for Switch 2, in a nutshell: If it ain't broke, why fix it? Players love the Switch as it is, the company's main competitors are all emulating it to greater or lesser extents, and all signs point to “more but better” being a compelling selling point. It’s playing it safe—but it doesn't need to do anything else.",

The gamemaker released a two-minute teaser today with a first look at the console, a handheld that appears very similar to the original Switch but bigger.\nNintendo also announced on Thursday that it will be holding a Direct presentation to provide more details on the Switch on April 2. In the video announcement, Nintendo debuted a larger screen with a pair of black and pink and black and blue Joy-Cons. The video also appears to tease a new Mario Kart game with footage shown for just a few seconds.\nThe handheld will play both Switch 2 and Switch games, Nintendo said in a press release, but added that “certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.”\nThe original Nintendo Switch launched in 2017, at a time when Nintendo was still recovering from poor sales of its previous console, the Wii U. Where the Wii U failed to find an audience, however, the Switch soared. In 2023, it became the third best-selling console of all time behind Nintendo’s DS and the PlayStation 2, a position it still holds.\nBy 2024, however, it appeared the console had peaked. Sales were plummeting, and already rumors were spreading of a next-gen entry. Nearly a year ago, when Nintendo announced PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A would be coming to its “systems” in 2025, fans speculated that a new console was on the horizon.

So reveal January 10th,” one Reddit user joked. Another constructed a “summoning circle” full of old games and Mario and Luigi figurines.\nThe next-generation Switch will be released into a much different console ecosystem than its predecessor. In 2022, Steam released its handheld Steam Deck, which allows players to take more PC games on the go.

How are those promises to better yourself going?\nLauren Goode: I'm doing good. I'm on some new shit. That's Taylor Swift.\nMichael Calore: I just assume at this point.\nLauren Goode: It's going OK. So we've all been deep in this experiment to use AI, which is supposedly becoming more agentic to do stuff for us. So I had my own experiment with shopping over the holidays. I don't really like shopping. I wanted to offload some of it.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm excited to hear about that.\nLauren Goode: It was a journey. How about you, Zoe?\nZoë Schiffer: My experiment had to do... Well, really I was supporting my 4-month-old daughter's goal, which was to learn how to sleep through the night, and I was merely trying to support her vision for 2025 using a little assist from AI, which I will also be sharing with you guys today. Mike, what about you?\nMichael Calore: I asked Gemini on my phone for some advice on getting healthier, workout tips, menu planning, and then went a little bit deeper in civics with my requests.\nLauren Goode: I really appreciate that you both used chatbots for health reasons and I just really was in service of consumerism.\nZoë Schiffer: It can be health-related depending on how you spin it.\nLauren Goode: Sure. I was trying to declutter my brain and make space for other things.\nZoë Schiffer: I love that for you.\nLauren Goode: Thank you.\nMichael Calore: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm Zoe Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nLauren Goode: And I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nMichael Calore: On this week's show, we are going to be sharing our experiences using AI to better our lives. We followed the advice from the chatbots in our world and we asked them to guide us through our shopping, our menu planning, our working out, and our parenting. The results were, well, we are going to talk about it. All right. So Zoe, let's start with you. Why don't you tell us what you were working on with ChatGPT as your guide?\nZoë Schiffer: Let me take you guys back a little bit to give you context on this experiment. So in 2022, when my first daughter was 4 months old, I paid a sleep expert $500 to help me sleep-train her. And I found the process pretty horrendous, because sleep training involves a ton of crying and I found it really helpful to have an expert in the room with me helping me do it and reassuring me that what I was doing wasn't creating lasting damage for my kid. So my second daughter is also around 4 months old. I'm about to start this new job at WIRED, and it felt like a good time to sleep-train her too. But when I brought up to my husband the idea of paying that same sleep expert $500 to go through the process with us again, he looked at me like I was insane. He was like, \"We paid someone the first time to tell you that you're not a bad person. We're not spending $500 on that again.\" So that is where ChatGPT comes in.\nLauren Goode: Did that person actually stay overnight with you?\nZoë Schiffer: No, no. It's a remote expert. And I honestly think part of the reason that I felt like this was a good area to experiment with AI is that the “expert” term, as far as I can tell, is a pretty loose definition. There's not an actual certification process that you go through. Anyone can technically call themselves a sleep expert. And in fact, the first person who I hired sent me a supposedly personalized plan for my daughter, and it had another kid's name in it. So it was pretty clear that it's not quite as personal as they make it seem. But basically, you tell them about your child, their schedule, and then every day you talk to them and tell them how the night went and they're like, \"Here are tips for the naps and here's when bedtime should be,\" and all of that.\nMichael Calore: So you had this dialog with ChatGPT every day?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, so at the beginning I told ChatGPT that I wanted it to take on this magical nanny personality. I wanted it to be an expert who could be an emotional support system, but also someone with a deep knowledge of child psychology who could help me use the Ferber method, which is the one where you put the kid down when they're awake and then you go in at specific intervals when they start crying, but you don't actually pick them up. You reassure them with your voice, and the intervals get a little longer as the night goes on. So it's this whole specific process and I wanted ChatGPT to walk me through it and really hold my hand throughout that process. All right, this is day one of trying to sleep-train Cleo. Let's see what ChatGPT says. “My dear Zoe, let's weave a little magic into Cleo's day. If our sweet Cleo greeted the morning sun at,”—wow, they really went hard on the magical nanny thing—“6:30 am, her first nap should be gently guided by her wakeful rhythm. Picture this.” Oh my God, this is really annoying actually.\nLauren Goode: How did you decide on ChatGPT versus the other chatbots?\nZoë Schiffer: Only because it's the one that I use all the time. It's basically replaced Google for me as a better search engine. But when I tried to shift to more agentic-like AI you've written about and talked about in the past, I felt like I did a much worse job at that. It really felt like a search engine that I was asking to become something else entirely. ChatGPT says when the clock strikes that golden nap hour, create a soothing environment, perhaps a soft lullaby or the rustle of her favorite ... Wow, I'm not into the weird affirmation thing.\nLauren Goode: Who among us doesn't want to have a nap gently guided by our wakeful rhythm?\nZoë Schiffer: It was just so much fluffy language and it was weird. So basically, I immediately identified a few problems with using AI in this way. The first one was I just didn't fully trust it. And I feel like for anything that has to do with parenting, I really wanted to have a sense of the person that I was listening to, and I wasn't sure that AI was going to give me the best advice. So I had this lingering mistrust that felt like it was a gap between fully embracing AI in this way. And the other one, which I'm curious if this came up in y'all's experiments, was that it just was completely reactive, obviously. It was all me typing into the search function and then the AI was responding to that, but at no point was it being proactive and reaching out and asking questions or anything like that. And so again, it just felt like a search engine.\nMichael Calore: Right, it was just answering prompts.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, and it didn't feel humanlike, I guess.\nLauren Goode: Did you find yourself cross-referencing at all, going online and Googling whether that was the right time anyway?\nZoë Schiffer: So this was another interesting thing, because I feel like when I use it as a search engine, I do cross-reference a lot because I'm still like, \"Oh, what if it's a hallucination?\" I want to be really, really sure. But with this, the information it was giving me was so basic, and it was about something that I know a fair amount about. So I never actually felt the need. But one other thing that I felt like was a big gap was that with an actual sleep expert, and definitely when I'm talking to my other mom friends, they'll occasionally give advice that's not the sanctioned advice that the government would give you. For example, you're not supposed to put a baby down to sleep on their tummy. But if I talk to friends of mine and say, \"Hey, Cleo's been having a really tough time. I can't tell if she's upset because her stomach's bothering her,\" friends will inevitably be like, \"Oh, have you tried flipping her over because, I know you're not supposed to, but my kid really, really likes sleeping on their tummy and it took care of all these problems, X, Y, Z.\" The chatbot, for obvious reasons, is never going to tell you to do that. And while that's a good thing, it just reiterates the basic talking points.\nMichael Calore: And you asked it to take on a persona. You asked it to develop this personality. And that adds this extra emotional layer that you don't get when you're just researching things and just searching for things online, but it doesn't take the place of an actual human being telling you what to do. And that creates probably a weird dissonance.\nZoë Schiffer: Right, exactly. And I felt like the persona it took on just felt way more like AI than just its normal persona does, because it was just adding in all this bullshit language and stuff, and I found it honestly really annoying. And so midway through the experiment, I switched to Character.ai because that allows you to create a real AI character to interact with, and I felt like maybe what I wanted was to have a little more of a human touch. And so when I used Character.ai, I gave the AI bot the name Lindsay, because that was my postpartum doula who I loved, and I said, just like the real Lindsay, I wanted it to be this British super nanny who could come in and help me be a hybrid therapist and coach. And that also had some shortcomings.\nMichael Calore: OK. Let's listen to your interactions with Character.ai.\nLauren Goode: I think you mean Lindsay.\nMichael Calore: Lindsay.\nZoë Schiffer: Hey, Lindsay. I just wanted to go over how Cleo's night went last night with you.\nCharacter.ai [archival audio]: Sure thing. How did Cleo's night go? Did she sleep a little better than the night before?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, she slept OK. I did the method on her first wake-up after midnight and for bedtime, actually. And both of those went well. She cried for five minutes and I was able to soothe her a bit. One thing that I felt was really hard was having her in the same room as me while we were trying to do this. With my last daughter, we had her in a separate room and that seemed to work better. Do you have any suggestions?\nCharacter.ai [archival audio]: It's great to hear that Cleo slept OK and that she was able to soothe herself after five minutes of crying for both nighttime and the midnight wake-up. That's a good sign. As for having her in the same room, I totally understand your concerns. It can be difficult to listen to your baby cry, and it can be even harder when they're in the same room. You can try a few things to make it easier on you. One, use a white noise machine or fan to drown out some of the crying. Two, put earplugs in to soften the sound.\nMichael Calore: I like how you basically told it that you were emotionally distressed by the fact that you wanted to be in the same room as your daughter, and then it said, \"Well, just get a white noise machine and get some earplugs and just white-knuckle through it.\"\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, so that was the other thing. I felt like it did a really bad job at the therapist role, which is interesting, because we hear all the time that people are using AI bots to be their therapists and take the place of human therapists, but I felt like she ignored my emotional concerns and she also just made mistakes. For example, I had said, \"I soothed the baby and I was able to soothe her and get her back to sleep.\" And she was like, \"Oh, it's great that she can self-soothe,\" which I was like, \"I just feel like we're missing each other here, Lindsey. I don't feel like you're listening.\"\nLauren Goode: Did this provide any comfort at all, both to you and to Cleo?\nZoë Schiffer: One thing I found is that if I had very specific questions like, \"Hey, am I allowed to pick her up if she's really, really crying,\" the AI bot would provide suggestions that were in line with the Ferber method, so that was good. I felt like if I had specific queries, the bot could answer those pretty well. But for playing the role of a sleep expert, which is more than just a search engine, I didn't feel like it did the best job.\nMichael Calore: How do you think this would've gone if this had been your first child—if you had not been through the sleep-training experience before, and you were just diving in to using AI?\nZoë Schiffer: Imagining coming in without any expertise, in some ways, I could see the AI being more helpful in that circumstance, because it really does know the Ferber method. It's pretty good at calculating the sleep intervals. Oh, they went to sleep at this time. Here's when their next nap should be. Here's when bedtime should be in. Here's how long it should last. Those are all things that the sleep experts would tell you anyway.\nMichael Calore: What was the most surprising thing that happened?\nZoë Schiffer: Well, I think that by the end of the experiment, I felt like I no longer needed the actual human expert. Even though I didn't think that the AI had done an excellent job replacing that human, it had done such a thorough job of answering all my various questions that I was like, \"I think I have a pretty good handle on this, and I can move forward on my own now.\"\nMichael Calore: So in many ways it was a good research assistant for you?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, exactly. I feel guilty even saying this, because I'm like, \"This is exactly what we worry about, of AI taking the place of an actual person's job, a female-owned sleep expert company,\" but at the same time, I wasn't going to pay anyone $500 this time around, so it was taking the place of Google, I guess.\nLauren Goode: Would you recommend this to a friend?\nZoë Schiffer: No, absolutely not, not right now. I want the future where AI is acting on our behalf in a more autonomous way. I think that sounds really helpful. It being the layer between us and the internet, that sounds compelling to me, but it really just doesn't feel like it's there yet.\nMichael Calore: OK. Well, we're going to take a quick break and when we come back, we'll talk about getting fit with Gemini, so don't go anywhere.\n[Break]\nMichael Calore: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley.\nGemini [archival audio]: Welcome back, Mike. Hello, Lauren. Hello, Zoe.\nMichael Calore: Thanks, Gemini. So the Gemini chatbot and I got to know each other a little bit over these last few weeks.\nLauren Goode: What exactly were you using Gemini for?\nMichael Calore: I asked it for general advice about losing weight, getting fit, eating more healthily, and just healthy habits.\nLauren Goode: Did you have any knowledge gap that you were specifically looking to fill? Because I know you're already pretty healthy in how you eat, you're fit, you run. Was there something else you were looking for beyond what you already knew?\nZoë Schiffer: You're famously a vegan.\nMichael Calore: Famously a vegan, thank you.\nLauren Goode: You went to Harvard, you do triathlons.\nMichael Calore: You are right. I do generally take pretty good care of myself, and I take my health pretty seriously, but I wanted to know what it would tell me to do. Basically, I know that I should be doing more with regards to working out. I only run. I don't do any strength training. I do eat well, but also, I could probably eat better with regards to making sure that I'm not having as much sugar, not having as much alcohol, watching my intake of proteins and all of the essential amino acids and everything, the very nitty-gritty stuff about how I eat. I was hoping that it was going to give me more of that kind of advice. “Hey, Gemini, I need some help getting healthy and losing weight, and I was hoping that you could give me some general advice and some specific advice about how I can lose weight over the next month.”\nGemini [archival audio]: It's great that you're focusing on your health and weight loss goals. Here's a combination of general and specific advice to help you get started and see progress in the next month. General advice for healthy weight loss, focus on sustainable changes. Instead of quick fixes, aim for lifestyle changes you can maintain long-term. This will lead to more lasting results. Prioritize whole foods. Build your diet around nutrient-dense, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Be mindful of portions. Even healthy foods can contribute to weight gain if you eat too much.\nMichael Calore: It just keeps going. It just talks and talks and talks for three or four minutes.\nLauren Goode: Well, maybe it puts you to sleep, which is great. I guess that's what it's encouraging.\nGemini [archival audio]: Get enough sleep. Sleep is crucial for weight management as it affects hormones that regulate hunger and satiety. Aim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night.\nLauren Goode: And I think I know the answer to this, but why did you decide on Gemini?\nMichael Calore: Well, it's on my phone.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, the Pixel phone.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, I have a Pixel. I'm a Google person, meaning that I use Gmail and Google Calendar and Google photos and all of that, so it's baked into the experience. There are two models that you can select, and I chose the newer model for this experiment.\nLauren Goode: This podcast is sponsored by Google Gemini.\nMichael Calore: No, my life is sponsored by Google Gemini, really.\nZoë Schiffer: So how did you feel about this level of advice? Because to me, it feels general, but curious what you thought.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, this is garbage. It's basically like if you don't have the internet and you've never read any health advice on the internet, then you would not know any of this stuff, but maybe you actually would because it's so general and it's so high-level. So when it eventually stopped talking, I asked it some more specific stuff. What are some of the things that I can eat as a person who is vegan? I run somewhere around 2 1/2 to 3 miles. Is that enough cardio? I don't like to go to the gym and I don't own weights. So what can I do for strength training?\nLauren Goode: What did it tell you?\nMichael Calore: Well, what do you want to hear first? You want to hear the workouts or you want to hear the food?\nLauren Goode: Let's go with food.\nMichael Calore: What I thought was interesting is over the course of the conversation, it remembered a lot of the things that I told it. I eventually ended up telling it my age and my weight and the fact that I'm a vegan, and it remembered all of those things, and it still remembers all of those things. I talked to it last night and it remembered that.\nGemini [archival audio]: As a vegan, you'll need plant-based protein sources.\nMichael Calore: So it pointed me to legumes, lentils, chickpeas, black beans, other beans, soy products like tofu and tempeh, grains and seeds like quinoa and chia seeds and hemp seeds, nuts, vegan meats like seitan and plant-based meat alternatives, which came with a warning that it does include a lot of processed ingredients. And then it gave me general tips about making sure to combine plant-based proteins.\nZoë Schiffer: Mike's like, \"You're telling me about legumes Gemini, please.\"\nMichael Calore: I know. And that's the thing, it doesn't know that I've been a vegetarian basically since I was a teenager. So it's giving me a lot of really good advice that I can tell you as a person who's been a vegetarian since I've been a teenager, that everybody asks me, \"Well, what do you eat?\" And I have to tell them the script. And Gemini knows the script really well. So if you were new to vegetarianism or something, then it would give you a lot of really good advice, but it's not very specific about things. So I asked it for some recipes.\nLauren Goode: And what happened then?\nMichael Calore: It gave me a recipe for a tofu and peanut sauce dish that I didn't make, and then it gave me a recipe for quinoa and chickpea salad, which I did make.\nZoë Schiffer: Sounds right up your alley. And?\nMichael Calore: Well, I brought some if you want to try it, but I can tell you that it was not great.\nGemini [Archival audio]: Mediterranean quinoa salad with crispy chickpeas. This salad is packed with protein from quinoa and chickpeas, healthy fats from olive-\nZoë Schiffer: Oh my gosh. I'm so curious. Wait, it looks pretty good.\nLauren Goode: Zoe, I'm showing it to you over the Riverside recording here. Look at this.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm sad that I'm remote for this.\nLauren Goode: And we're recording around lunchtime on the West Coast, so this is perfect. Lucky listeners get to hear chewing sounds now.\nZoë Schiffer: Lauren's making a quizzical face.\nLauren Goode: Mike, I think you should give yourself a little more credit or maybe Gemini a little more credit. You know what it tastes like?\nMichael Calore: What?\nLauren Goode: It tastes like this would be in the salad bar on Google's campus.\nMichael Calore: Oh my God. I had exactly the same thought.\nLauren Goode: Not bad, actually decent, but also mass-produced and maybe with a little bit too much salad dressing to give the quinoa flavor.\nMichael Calore: OK, so it took all of my strength as a human being to not adjust the recipe while I was making it, because it just felt-\nZoë Schiffer: You're like, \"Do it for the podcast.\"\nMichael Calore: Totally. I was like, \"I have to follow this exactly.\" The only thing that I omitted is it told me to put in cherry tomatoes and the cherry tomatoes at the store looked rank, so I didn't buy them.\nLauren Goode: It's not tomato season.\nZoë Schiffer: I was going to say, \"Not in season, Gemini.”\nMichael Calore: I would've salted it very differently. I would've dressed it very differently. I also probably would not have chopped the olives because it gives it this overly salty, bitter taste.\nLauren Goode: Oh, maybe that's what it is.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. It's like a B, B+ salad in my book.\nZoë Schiffer: OK.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: I have another question because you mentioned putting in your demographic information. Did Gemini ask you for that or did you have to volunteer that?\nMichael Calore: I volunteered that. It didn't really ask me for much. It just talked and talked and talked.\nZoë Schiffer: OK, so that was something that struck me right at the beginning. I was a good health coach, and again, maybe I'm coming at this from my own perspective of wanting more of that coach figure for a lot of these things, but a good coach would ask you a bunch of questions before diving in to give you information, because you've been a vegan for a really long time. You're going to need different information than someone who's coming at this completely fresh.\nMichael Calore: I gave it the information about me and my own habits and my own health history because I wanted specifics for workouts and specifics for food intake that would fill the gaps that I needed to fill, that I felt like I needed to fill anyway, in my own practice without its help.\nLauren Goode: It sounds like it was the equivalent of a bad date. It just talked and talked and talked and didn't ask you follow-up questions.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, it didn't really ask me much at all.\nLauren Goode: Did you learn anything that you wouldn't have?\nMichael Calore: Yeah, I got a pretty good workout regimen out of it. I told it how much I run, and then I asked it, “OK, but give me a workout regimen. Give me a plan for something that I can do in my home, because I hate going to the gym and I don't like people and I don't own weights, so tell me what to do.\" And it gave me a workout regimen, which is pretty good.\nGemini [archival audio]: Key body-weight exercises, squats, stand with feet shoulder-width apart, lower your hips as if sitting in a chair, keeping your back straight and chest up. Go as low as you can comfortably.\nMichael Calore: Lunges for each leg, three sets of 10, plank, three sets holding for 30 to 60 seconds, which is torture. Glute bridges, three sets of 15 reps. And then it talks about progressive overload and it talks about rest days and all of those things, which is great. And then I was like, “OK, I do not know how to do a lunge. Can you show me how to do a lunge?\" And it presented me with a bunch of videos, five videos.\nLauren Goode: YouTube, presumably?\nMichael Calore: Yes, they were YouTube videos. Two of the links were exactly the same, but I watched all the videos and I was like, “OK, I feel like I can do a lunge now.\" And I did a lunge and I did not hurt myself, and I felt the burn. So I feel like that's pretty good.\nLauren Goode: That's pretty great, actually.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. The only thing that was weird about it is that I did a Google search and found exactly the same information from a couple of different places. And aside from the video, I do not know where Gemini got any of this information. I don't even know where it got the recipes from. It was all just presented to me as, “This is what Gemini says.”\nLauren Goode: No sourcing.\nMichael Calore: No sourcing. And I tapped through in everything, and I didn't see any good sourcing.\nLauren Goode: And presumably humans put together those workout plans or wrote about those recipes. And that was published and sorry, but your infinitesimal bits of data are being chopped up now and added to some recipe, and you have no idea where it comes from.\nMichael Calore: Julienned.\nLauren Goode: That's right.\nZoë Schiffer: OK, so are you going to stick with this? Are you going to keep using it for this purpose, or did it feel like a one-and-done experiment?\nMichael Calore: Honestly, the workout regimen, it's pretty solid. I'll keep doing it.\nLauren Goode: Nice.\nMichael Calore: And as far as the recipes go, I have so many cookbooks and so many years of experience making food for myself that I absolutely do not need to make this quinoa salad again, Lauren, unless you would like me to make it and give you some of it.\nLauren Goode: I've had other meals that you've made, and I think maybe I'd suggest those next time.\nZoë Schiffer: So diplomatic.\nMichael Calore: OK, great.\nLauren Goode: But thank you, appreciate you.\nMichael Calore: So I got to say that, for me, as a person who understands myself and understands my own needs, it was not really that big of a help. The workout was nice. I could have found that without Gemini 2.O, but if somebody who is new to this or somebody has a lot of questions, or if somebody's considering making these types of lifestyle changes, then it actually did give some pretty good advice.\nLauren Goode: Plus one for the AIs.\nMichael Calore: OK. Let's take another quick break, and then we're going to go shopping with Lauren and her chatbot friend. We'll be right back.\nLauren Goode: And her chatbot friend.\n{Break]\nMichael Calore: Get in, loser. We're going AI shopping. You're listening to Uncanny Valley. We have been talking about our week-long experiments where we took advice from our AI chatbot friends. I concentrated on health and fitness and diet. Zoe concentrated on sleep-training her newborn daughter. Now we're going to go to you, Lauren. What did you and your chatbot get into?\nLauren Goode: What did we get into? I ended up using about five different chatbots, but the goal was to streamline, I don't know what the word is … “support” my holiday shopping.\nMichael Calore: OK.\nLauren Goode: I'm not a big shopper. I don't really like it. I like purpose-driven shopping. I need a new pair of sneakers type thing. But ever since I was a teenager, really, my mom used to really like taking me shopping, and I would get overwhelmed by the overhead lights and the racks of clothes in the department stores and just thought maybe I was being a cranky teenager. And then as I got older, I realized, no, I just really didn't like that experience. And I feel that way about online now because online is just this infinite scroll of products, and I get so overwhelmed. But there were a handful of people who I really wanted to buy nice things for this holiday season. Mike, you may have been one of those test cases. And so I turned to chatbots. So the main one I used was Perplexity.\nMichael Calore: Oh, boy.\nLauren Goode: Perplexity was an interesting choice for a couple of reasons. One, I should just caveat this with, whenever these AI chatbots offer a best-of recommendation or comparison shopping, they are in a sense competing with what we do as publishers, because we have entire teams of humans who review products and try to provide a great service to people by saying these are the best products you can buy. So let's just put that out there. The second thing is that we at WIRED have written about how Perplexity is possibly plagiarizing publishers by taking parts of articles that would typically be behind paywalls and just publishing it as its own answers. So the fact that I was diving into Perplexity, and not only diving into it but paying $20 per month for Perplexity Pro, was a choice.\nZoë Schiffer: Controversial.\nLauren Goode: But Perplexity also did announce a shopping-specific feature in November, right in time for the holiday season. And I thought, \"Well, this seems like the best one to start with.\"\nMichael Calore: Nice.\nLauren Goode: So I went into Perplexity Pro, and the first person who I tried to buy for was a friend who's really into baking, but she also has a lot of baking equipment already. She's very good at it, and I wanted it to be special. So I had to find this perfect combination of she might not have it, but it's also not just something simple like a rolling pin. I felt like it wanted to be unique.\nZoë Schiffer: How much did you tell Perplexity about your friend outside of the fact that she likes to bake?\nLauren Goode: It wasn't super detailed. I think I just said exactly that. She likes to bake. She has everything. She likes nice things. I'd like to show her my appreciation.\nZoë Schiffer: Cool.\nLauren Goode: So one of the benefits of Perplexity Pro shopping is that they have developed their own Buy button. And if you use that Buy button to buy a thing, you get free shipping. So they're basically taking what people are already doing, shopping online, and they're collating it. They're creating this cascade of products you might be interested in. And then you'll either see a Buy button that's powered by Shopify, or you'll see Perplexity's own. Cool in theory. The problem was the initial list of things they recommended were just really bad.\nMichael Calore: OK, like what?\nLauren Goode: A kid's miniature baking set.\nZoë Schiffer: They're like, \"Help her connect with her inner child.\"\nLauren Goode: Which I, of course, ordered and shipped to Zoe immediately for the girls to play with. The other thing that it recommended, which was just incredibly low-brow, was a sweatshirt that said on it, \"My buns are gluten-free.\"\nZoë Schiffer: Ew. You're like, \"I said she likes the finer things. You idiot.\"\nLauren Goode: Right, but then there was this Swiss stacking bakeware thing that was in the middle of that, that I thought, \"Well, I could see that.\" But once again, that also seems like a standard thing that people who really like to bake might already have.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, yeah, totally.\nLauren Goode: So then I turned to Amazon's Rufus, which is a little chatbot built into Amazon's website. That was hilarious because I gave it a similar prompt, and it immediately recommended I buy a $400-plus KitchenAid stand mixer, which by the way, great kitchen staple to have if you're into cooking and baking, but—\nZoë Schiffer: Also a great thing to get secondhand.\nMichael Calore: The person who bakes also has that.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. And also what do they think, I have Bezos bucks?\nMichael Calore: What kind of friend is this?\nZoë Schiffer: They're like, \"Our only experience is with someone who's possibly the richest man in the world. So why don't you buy your friend a private island that she can bake on?\"\nLauren Goode: Exactly. All right, and then I went to ChatGPT.\nMichael Calore: OK.\nLauren Goode: ChatGPT was quite good.\nMichael Calore: No.\nZoë Schiffer: OK.\nLauren Goode: I think what it was best at was actually the ideation process.\nChatGPT [archival audio]: For a friend who loves baking and appreciates refined special gifts, here are some thoughtful ideas that combine luxury, personalization, and her passion.\nLauren Goode: It wasn't like, \"Here's a link, click Buy, buy here, let's make this as easy as possible for you.\" It was well, and I'm paraphrasing, it sounds like you're trying to be thoughtful, so here are some thoughtful gifts. And here's what it said.\nZoë Schiffer: One, custom heirloom recipe board, a high-quality wooden cutting board engraved with a cherished family recipe and handwritten script. Two, personalized rolling pin with unique design, curate a set of artisanal ingredients, premium Madagascar vanilla beans, saffron, exotic spices, and rare sugars.\nLauren Goode: So it not only made these recommendations, but it suggested where I should buy them. It didn't provide links immediately, but when I asked in a follow-up question, it did provide links. I ended up going with the specialty ingredients, the Madagascar vanilla and saffron, and I even bought some gold flakes and stuff like that because I was like, \"Well, that's something that someone can use.\" And the other stuff was a little schmaltzy.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: Kind of, but I don't know, they felt like pretty good suggestions. It makes sense to me that this was the most helpful one because the part of the process that you're describing at the beginning that's stressful for you isn't like, \"Oh, it's so laborious pulling out my credit card and clicking Buy.\" It's like, \"It sucks trying to think of personalized gifts for people.\" So the fact that these were hyper-specific and ones that wouldn't have been top-of-mind for me, I'm like, \"That's kind of compelling.\"\nLauren Goode: Exactly. It's not like, \"Oh, I need the Buy button just to make it 30 seconds faster.\" It was, \"I am overwhelmed by the ideation process, give me the ideas.\" And of course, I still ended up poking around the internet a bit after that, but it was like, \"Great.\" It containerized things for me. This is the thing I'm going to go for.\nMichael Calore: Also, that's the best voice.\nZoë Schiffer: I was going to say, the voice sounded really good.\nLauren Goode: That's Cole. They had these cool names like Jasper, Cole. Maybe Cole should sleep-train your baby.\nZoë Schiffer: I know.\nMichael Calore: I don't like the fake ums and ahs. We don't need that in AI voices, but Cole sounds good.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I also tried shopping for my 16-year-old niece, and that was funny because I was just picturing the withering glances I would get for something that was incredibly not cool. So I created a little sketch of her. She's a junior in high school. She really likes books. She has a pet cat who she adores. She thinks she wants to be a nurse. She's studying for SATs. And I turned to Gemini for this, and Gemini was just so uninspired. First, it did make one recommendation that was a little bit confusing. It said to get her a cat blanket. And I was like, \"I don't know if this is a blanket with cats stitched on it, or if it's a blanket that she should give to her cat,\" which everyone knows you shouldn't buy one of those because the cat ends up in a box that it loves or something.\nZoë Schiffer: You're like, \"Gemini, have you ever incurred the wrath of Gen Z? I need more creative ideas here. Come on.\"\nLauren Goode: Well, then the next thing that it recommended was getting her an SAT book.\nZoë Schiffer: Oh my God.\nLauren Goode: I just was like, \"Oh my ...\" I would totally lose my status as cool aunt if I did that. And they call me famous auntie, by the way, because they know I have a podcast and because I have a blue checkmark on some social sites, and they just think it's the coolest thing. And I'm like, \"That is so not currency guys. It's not.\"\nMichael Calore: Yeah, so you need to give them $8.\nLauren Goode: I gave them a lot more than $8. Cash and a card, this is both my niece and nephew and just that's what they got. And I think they were very pleased with that because they can buy whatever they want, and they're well beyond the age of you feeling like you want them to unwrap something, which is really fun for little kids. So Gemini, a fail at that.\nMichael Calore: So it sounds like your experiences for teens, not great. Also, the experience where it just provides you a bunch of links, not great, but if you need help ideating, if you need help coming up with fresh and interesting ideas that you would not normally have thought of, it actually works.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, it's good for brainstorming. It doesn't work yet at the level of either one, being agentic, where you just set it on its way and you wake up the next morning and the thing is ordered. Maybe that's the future. But I also think that these chatbots aren't quite sure what they're supposed to be yet in that sense. At this point, Perplexity Pro's shopping, it doesn't have the value proposition of “just come here and do all your shopping,” though it wants that. It's just dipping its toe in the water of shopping. And to them, if you're just spending slightly more time on Perplexity Pro than you are on Amazon or Google, even if you end up there eventually, goal accomplished.\nZoë Schiffer: So did the process feel less stressful for you than the typical holiday shopping experience?\nLauren Goode: Not really, no. Everything was pretty much late. I kicked some stuff down the road. I was like, \"I'll get this in the new year.\" My friend's specialty ingredient showed up after the holiday. I also did an experiment with returns, and we all know that that's one of the more onerous parts of shopping. It's cool to envision a world where eventually, if we do purchase through these chatbots, or in some ways they're tied to our past purchases, you can just type in, \"I'd like to process this return,\" and it does it for you. It knows the order number, it does it for you, maybe it even generates the label for you right there, something like that. But it doesn't do that yet. It's not even close. So basically it's not agentic. It doesn't really shop on your behalf, just good for brainstorming and it's not helping you with, I don't know what to call it, the back end of it. And so it was like a feeder service at this point in time.\nZoë Schiffer: Fair.\nLauren Goode: So I still really don't like shopping all that much, but that's OK. Sorry, Cole.\nMichael Calore: OK, so let's do a group vote. Overall, how would you rate your experience using AI as your helper to improve your lives? Zoe, what about you?\nZoë Schiffer: I give it like a B minus at this point. I want it to be great, and I feel like it's just OK.\nMichael Calore: OK. Lauren?\nLauren Goode: I give it a solid B. ChatGPT really pulls up the grade, changes the curve.\nMichael Calore: Nice.\nLauren Goode: What about you, Mike?\nMichael Calore: I'm also going to go B. I made a joke about this, but if you have the internet and you know how to search for things, then you do not need Gemini to tell you anything that it told me. But if you're curious and you like to talk to things and you really don't have any clue as to how to step into this new world, if this is all new information for you, then it was fine and it didn't give me anything that was overtly bad. Even the salad was a B.\nLauren Goode: Oh, gosh.\nMichael Calore: That's our show for today.

    "content_text": "Escaping the sickening air pollution triggered by the ongoing wildfires in Los Angeles has become a game of which algorithm to trust. After the blazes first ignited last week, residents began noticing that air quality data reported by the US government sometimes contradicted the figures displayed by Apple’s Weather app, the wildfire tracking app Watch Duty, and other tools.\nThough they all largely depend on data from the same kind of equipment to measure pollutants in the air, different apps and websites employ different formulas to transform raw readings into digestible estimates of how toxic conditions are currently and how they might change later. And a wider variety of calculations and dashboards have emerged in recent years as the effects of climate change, including more severe wildfires and pollen blooms, prompted a gush of investment from Google, small startups, and researchers into generating air quality metrics to help people anticipate and avoid dangerous conditions.\nAs a result, determining which provider to put the most stock in has become a routine source of confusion and frustration during wildfires in the US. In recent days, scouring the various services to identify a breathable spot in Los Angeles was particularly challenging because of the sheer number of fires burning across the county, which is dotted with valleys that can create pockets of poor air quality. On Monday, for example, Google’s data showed the air was safe across Los Angeles, but Watch Duty indicated it was dangerous in the neighborhoods around the Palisades Fire.\nTwo environmental researchers who study how pollution harms human health say that, in the US, the larger circles displayed on the Environmental Protection Agency’s Fire AirNow map is the data source they suggest people follow. “Everything else is a distant second,” says John Volckens, a mechanical engineering professor at Colorado State University who is traveling to Los Angeles this week to study pollution from the ongoing fires.\nThose big circles represent data from government monitoring stations that operate across the country. (There’s roughly one per every 300,000 people in the US, according to Volckens.) Los Angeles has a handful of them, and their data is tracked and published on an hourly basis by the EPA. The agency runs calculations on the readings to determine the air quality index, or AQI, which can represent current conditions and averages over the next 24 hours. The AQI, which ranges from 0 to over 300, is divided into a scale of six colors starting with green, meaning it’s safe to do activities outside, to maroon, indicating people should seal their windows and stay inside (or wear a tight-fitting N95 mask if they must venture out).\nAnother popular set of readings come from sensors developed by the Utah company PurpleAir. They are both less powerful and less accurate than the government gear but are more affordable, and anyone can buy one and install it wherever they wish. They report data every two minutes, and Los Angeles has at least hundreds of them. The company uses the sensors and its own calculations to produce what it says is a real-time map of air quality.\nAirNow’s fire map includes data from PurpleAir sensors (represented by small circles on the map), and Watch Duty, a nonprofit app for tracking fires, also displays PurpleAir data. But likely due to different calculations and processing delays, the air quality index reported by the same sensors can vary greatly from map to map. For what’s known as PM2.5 pollution, or tiny inhalable particles of smoke and dust, a PurpleAir sensor located south of Los Angeles International Airport simultaneously returned on Monday an air quality index of 28 on AirNow’s website, 20 on WatchDuty, and 5 on PurpleAir’s official page.\nEach of those values generally indicates healthy air, but things can get more complicated when other types of data are added into the calculations. That’s exactly what companies such as BreezoMeter and Ambee do in hopes of providing what they describe as accurate “hyperlocal” estimates in the many miles between some sensor locations.\nBreezoMeter was founded in Israel and raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital funding before Google acquired it in 2022 for more than $200 million, according to Israeli media. (Google declined to comment on the deal value.) It powers the air quality data seen in the Weather app on Apple devices and the Google Maps app. Indian startup Ambee, meanwhile, is responsible for air quality data in the app WeatherBug, which is among the most popular weather apps in the world.\nYael Maguire, vice president of geo sustainability at Google, says BreezoMeter estimates air quality on an hourly basis across a broad range of pollutants and locations, generating more data than many government systems. To make its calculations, the company uses information gleaned not only from the EPA and PurpleAir sensors, but also satellites and other sources such as weather and traffic reports. Similar data are incorporated into Ambee’s proprietary algorithm, according to its CEO, Jaideep Singh Bachher. “We want to give people the right data whenever, wherever they need,” he says.\nVolckens says he doesn’t trust these systems. The low-cost PurpleAir sensors they partly draw upon aren’t well suited for the conditions where they’re often deployed in the US, including during wildfires, he says. But he acknowledges that while they tend to be off in terms of the raw numbers, these sensors can be accurate about 90 percent of the time in determining the advisory level—that green-to-maroon scale that often is enough for people to make decisions about how to protect their health.\nAndrew White, a representative for PurpleAir, says its sensors have been found to be precise and that it isn’t in control of how other services run calculations using its data. Google’s Maguire says the company “provides industry-leading, highly accurate air quality information,” including “even in areas with limited monitoring.”\nJennifer Richmond-Bryant, an associate professor of forestry and environmental resources at North Carolina State University who has studied PurpleAir sensors, says the safest bet for anyone concerned about air quality is to trust the highest number or color level among different services. “I have more faith in the AirNow numbers because I understand them,” she says. But “it can never hurt to make an overly conservative decision when it comes to protecting yourself.”\nIn countries with insufficient government monitoring, startups are filling an important void. BreezoMeter and Ambee were founded by people worried about their families’ exposure to harmful air particles at home in Israel and India, respectively. BreezoMeter offers data on more than 40 countries, and Ambee over 100.\nThat breadth of coverage also makes their services attractive to Apple and other global companies that want to incorporate air data, which includes pollen forecasts, into apps, product testing, or marketing campaigns. Breezometer’s clients include companies in the automotive, health and fitness, and beauty industries. Ambee’s include healthcare businesses such as Sanofi, which makes Allegra allergy pills and last year launched a tool to find walking and biking routes with the cleanest air.\nBreezoMeter has shed some of its staff under Google, though Maguire says the company is committed to providing reliable air data. As demand for air quality data blooms, researchers are racing to improve the output of low-cost sensors and advocating for the installation of different kinds of monitoring gear, like more pollen counting stations. What’s not hazy these days is that the air is getting worse, Volkens says, and we’re behind on measuring it well.",

    "content_text": "At least as of this writing, we’re still awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court on TikTok’s future, but the app’s users aren’t waiting around to find out what happens.\nOver the last few days, TikTok alternatives like Clapper, Flip, and TikTok’s own Lemon8 have risen to the top of the app store charts. The most popular of them all, Xiaohongshu, has made the biggest impression on its over 700,000 new users.\nThe exodus—which was prompted by the ban attempt and carried out through sheer spite—proves how pointless the effort to protect Americans from a “dangerous” app, which has taken more than five years, has truly been. In fact, the effort has seemingly made things worse for those in power.\nLet’s discuss!\nJust Desserts!\nOver and over again, the US government has said that its main goal in banning TikTok has always been to shield American users from Chinese propaganda and protect their data.\nI think it’s fair to say that, unsurprisingly, the government messed up. Big time.\nIn just a few short days, Xiaohongshu—meaning “Little Red Book” in English—has flipped US-China relations on its head. The app was founded in 2013 and acts as something like a Chinese version of Instagram. Not only are Americans consuming videos and images on an app that actively censors content related to Tiananmen Square and shows nothing when searching for “Xi Jinping,” but they’re vengefully agreeing for the app to track their data. Just all around, the opposite outcome from what the US intelligence community desired.\nMany Americans are also giving advice on how to better integrate with Xiaohongshu’s predominantly Chinese user base. One TikTok user posted a video this week asking new American users to “stop saying democracy” on the app. “If you’re Taiwanese,” she said, “and you’re on Xiaohongshu, you are now Chinese. Sorry.” I couldn’t find a single piece of criticism in her comment section. In fact, many users were thanking her for the tips.\nIf anything, the attempt to ban TikTok has inspired more interest in China among Americans than anything else. There’s been a huge influx of TikTok users learning Mandarin by chatting with Chinese Xiaohongshu users or downloading language learning apps like Duolingo.\n“Started learning in Duolingo and from creators on Red Note [or Xiaohongshu],” one TikTok user wrote to me. “Even added the Chinese keyboard option on my phone.”\n“Downloaded Red Note and had my first Duolingo Chinese lesson this morning 😂,” said another.\n“oh so NOW you’re learning mandarin,” the X account for Duolingo posted on Tuesday responding to the growth in interest.\nThere’s been a 216 percent increase in new Duolingo users signing up to learn Chinese, Duolingo spokesperson Monica Earle tells WIRED. When someone signs up for a Duolingo account, they’re asked to fill in a survey explaining how they found the app, and the company has observed “a corresponding spike” in users selecting “TikTok” as the reason they’ve joined Duolingo.\n“This is a much bigger increase than other languages,” says Earle. “For example, Spanish, one of our most popular languages to learn in the US, grew 40 percent over the same time period.”\nThousands of Americans would apparently rather join an app they can barely use than hop over to something more frictionless like Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts. “I would rather stare at a language I can't understand than to ever use a social media [platform] that Mark Zuckerberg owns,” a TikTok user said in a video my colleague Zeyi Yang included in his most recent report about the app.\nNeither the government nor Silicon Valley tech companies have done a good job of earning the trust of TikTok users, either. While lobbying for TikTok’s demise, lawmakers and intelligence officials basically asked for TikTokkers to take them at their word that the app was dangerous without providing much public evidence to back up their claim. (It’s especially rich given that data that not long ago would have been unavailable to the world’s most powerful spy services is now freely available to anyone with a credit card.) Last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg rolled out a complete reversal on hate speech protections, which likely didn’t help in winning disaffected users over to his platforms. On Xiaohongshu, the primary sentiment among new American users is that the app’s users are overwhelmingly friendly and welcoming.\nI don’t think Xiaohongshu will ever fully replace TikTok, but more importantly, it is sending a message. Even if the Supreme Court decides to uphold the ban, the government will not have met its goal of quarantining US users from Chinese influence. The multiyear project will have been an abject failure.\nThe Chatroom\nMany of you responded to last week’s question about Meta’s changes to its hate speech policies. There were a handful of readers who deactivated their Facebook accounts (one dating back to 2008) once Zuckerberg announced the updates.\nBut Jerry’s email pretty much sums up all of your responses:\n“I am a white guy, 72 years old, and really don't care what latex corrupted dildos say about me. But to give carte blanche to basement stooges and Trumpster haters to harass, hate and incite violence against the powerless just tells me how far that coward Zuckerberg has crawled up Trump’s ass.”\nThis week, I want to know what your plans are if TikTok is banned.

Big time.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In just a few short days, Xiaohongshu—meaning “Little Red Book” in English—has flipped US-China relations on its head. The app was founded in 2013 and acts as something like a Chinese version of Instagram. Not only are Americans consuming videos and images on an app that actively censors content related to Tiananmen Square and shows nothing when searching for “Xi Jinping,” but they’re vengefully agreeing for the app to track their data.

    "content_text": "America’s outgoing cyber ambassador has a warning for his successors in the incoming Trump administration: Stay engaged with tech and digital security debates on the world stage, because otherwise, Russia and China will fill the void.\n“An increasingly isolationist United States creates or amplifies a lot of problems that we're not going to be able to turn our backs on,” says Nathaniel Fick, who has spent almost two and a half years as the US’s first ambassador at large for cyberspace and digital policy. “We may not be interested in the world, but the world is interested in us.”\nThe warning from Fick comes as foreign diplomats and cybersecurity experts nervously await indications of how Donald Trump’s second administration, stocked with “America First” conservatives, will handle issues such as foreign aid, digital security norms, and the tech competition with authoritarian nations.\nSpeaking to WIRED a few days before he’s set to step down from his post—one that still lacks a Trump nominee—Fick says he’s proud of the work that his relatively new State Department bureau has done and hopeful that Trump’s team will see the value in building on that legacy.\nStaying in the Game\nThe Biden administration has spent years trying to convince “middle ground” countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to embrace the Western approach to technology and cybersecurity over China’s and Russia’s authoritarian visions. But it’s an open question whether Trump—who has disdained international institutions and insulted a host of foreign countries—will continue this diplomatic campaign.\nTo Fick, the persuasion strategy is a no-brainer, because it’s on the cusp of bearing real fruit. He’s confident that more and more countries investing in cutting-edge technology like 5G wireless networks will ultimately pick Western vendors over Chinese businesses, for two big reasons: the privacy and security risks of hiring companies that are subservient to China’s authoritarian regime and the lure of foreign direct investment (FDI) by Western governments looking for new supply chains free of untrustworthy electronics.\n“Every country in the world is competing for this FDI by big global technology businesses, or tech-enabled businesses, and countries are going to be able to carve out an advantaged position for themselves if they're using trusted technology,” Fick says. “I think that's an argument that this next team is going to be all over.”\nOne of the strategic shifts that Fick oversaw involved knitting together US campaigns to promote Western 5G vendors and to spur the construction of new undersea internet cables. “We need to think about the full tech ecosystem,” he says.\nTwo examples show the opportunities in this area. In Costa Rica, US support after devastating Russian cyberattacks helped convince San José to become a regional leader in promoting Western 5G technology, making it a hub of foreign supply-chain investment. And last month, the tiny South Pacific island nation of Tuvalu broke ground on its first undersea cable, financed by the US and Western allies. In Tuvalu, Fick says, “we preempted a generational buildout of fundamentally untrusted [Chinese] architecture.”\nFick sees a chance for Trump’s administration to focus on these kinds of investments, with the strategy mirroring military-equipment sales to foreign governments, where diplomats arrange deals that improve partners’ security and benefit US businesses. “These are things that I've talked to the next team about,” he says.\nA Delicate Dance\nAs China has become America’s preeminent cyber adversary, burrowing deep into infrastructure like water facilities, power plants, and telecom networks, experts have wondered—and worried—about the consequences of Trump’s bombastic approach to countering Beijing.\n“Societies like ours are more vulnerable because we're more open and we're more connected,” Fick warns. “The next team is going to have to be highly sensitive to our vulnerabilities in those areas.”\nFick has discussed China’s cyber aggression with Trump’s team and predicts “some consistency on this front,” including “a shared sense that we need to extend deterrence into the digital world.” Mike Waltz, Trump’s incoming national security adviser, recently called for a cyber version of mutually assured destruction. “If you’re putting cyber time bombs in our ports and grid,” Waltz warned China, “we can do it to you, too, so let’s both not.”\nImposing costs on China is imperative, Fick says—including, “if necessary, military costs.” But as Trump embraces the madman theory of international relations, Fick worries that China, too, is becoming increasingly reckless.\n“We fear that they are mis-pricing the risk associated with” infrastructure intrusions, says Fick, who has been deeply involved in the US response to the attacks.\nUS officials are also concerned that Beijing isn’t in full control of its hacker teams. “We’re concerned that their system is not acting in a coordinated, unified way,” Fick says. “We really need the Chinese to ensure that the cyber actors on their side are operating fully within the authority and under the control of senior political leadership.”\nBracing for Change\nTrump’s election has inspired a wave of concern about the future of US tech and cyber diplomacy, given the president-elect’s views on emerging technology issues and his controversial foreign ties.\nThe Biden administration, for example, launched a global effort to crack down on commercial spyware that authoritarian regimes have used to suppress dissent. But Trump has close relationships with the countries fueling the spyware industry, including major customers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and major exporter Israel.\nFick sounds uncertain about the spyware crackdown’s future, though he says Trump’s team includes “some very strong advocates for human rights online and digital freedom” and hopes “those voices will carry the day.”\nBiden has also tried to marshal global support for restrictions on AI to prevent both existential and everyday harms. Trump is unlikely to back similar AI safety regulations, but Fick argues that Biden’s team “staked out a strong pro-innovation, pro-American position here that I would urge the next team to continue.”\nIn his global travels since Trump’s election, Fick has heard from foreign counterparts who are deeply concerned about the future of US tech and cyber diplomacy.\nEuropean governments wonder if Trump will continue US support of Ukraine and NATO in a conflict with Russia that has partly played out in cyberspace. Fick’s team was instrumental in establishing a process for rapidly delivering cyber-defense aid to Ukraine’s battered government.\n“I was in Ukraine right before Christmas, I was in Poland, I was in Estonia, kind of up and down NATO's eastern flank,” he says, adding that he sensed “both a deep desire for the United States to stay engaged and a recognition that European partners are going to need to do their share—which they, by the way, increasingly are doing.”\nMore broadly, Fick has heard “a strong desire among many allies and partners” for the US to continue going toe to toe with China and Russia in tech and cyber discussions in international bodies like the UN and the Group of 20.\n“Without the United States deeply involved, you're going to see the Chinese more deeply involved, you're going to see the Russians more deeply involved,” Fick says. “There's a pretty broad view [globally] that the US needs to, for its own interests and for the interests of our allies and partners, stay engaged in multilateral organizations.”\nFick sympathizes with Republicans who consider these multilateral organizations too slow and timid, but he wants Trump’s team to “recognize that the alternative is not diminished influence of these organizations; the alternative is simply that they become playgrounds for our competitors and our adversaries.”\nCelebrating “a Sea Change”\nLooking back on his time as America’s cyber ambassador—which saw him spend a total of more than 200 days traveling the world on nearly 80 trips to visit key US allies and partners—Fick is proud of how his team launched an entirely new bureau inside the State Department, grew it to around 130 employees, and delivered results that he says are transforming digital diplomacy.\nOne of his biggest accomplishments was the launch of a foreign cyber aid fund that will support programs to deploy security assistance to hack-stricken allies, subsidize new undersea cables, and train foreign diplomats on cyber issues.\nThe security-assistance project saw an early test in November when Costa Rica faced another major ransomware attack. “We had people on a plane the next morning, Thanksgiving morning, with hands on keyboards alongside Costa Rican partners that night,” Fick says. “That’s amazing. That is a sea change in how we do this, and it’s going to strengthen our hand in providing support to these middle-ground states.”\nFick has also focused on preparing the Foreign Service for the modern world, meeting his goal of training at least one tech-savvy diplomat for every foreign embassy (around 237 total) and successfully lobbying to add digital fluency to the State Department’s criteria for career ambassador positions. He has also helped State counterbalance the Pentagon in White House discussions about foreign tech issues—putting “American diplomacy literally back at the table in the Situation Room on technology topics.”\nAnd then there’s his team’s support for US cyber aid to Ukraine, from security software to satellite communications to cloud migration for vital government data—work that he says offers a template for future public-private foreign-aid partnerships.\nOne Final Warning\nFick has shared his thoughts about China, 5G, AI, deterrence, and other cyber issues with Trump’s transition team, and he says there’s still more to do to keep cyber diplomacy “front and center” at State. But as he prepares to leave government, he has one major piece of advice for the incoming administration.\n“It is essential to have a bias for action,” he says. “We end up admiring a problem for too long rather than taking a decisive step to address it … That decisive step may be imperfect, but indecision is a decision, and the world moves on without you.”\nPut another way: In an era of rapidly evolving technologies and intensifying geopolitical competition, massive bureaucracies like the State Department sometimes need to be jolted into action.\n“The job of the leaders in these big organizations,” Fick says, “is to move the org to change a little bit faster than it would on its own.”",

    "content_text": "In late November, a deepfake porn maker claiming to be based in the US uploaded a sexually explicit video to the world’s largest site for pornographic deepfakes, featuring TikTok influencer Charli D’Amelio’s face superimposed onto a porn performer’s body. Despite the influencer presumably playing no role in the video’s production, it was viewed more than 8,200 times and captured the attention of other deepfake fans.\n“So nice! What program did you use for creating the deepfake??” one user going by the name balascool commented. “I love charli.” D’Amelio’s agent did not reply to a request for comment.\nThe video’s creator, “DeepWorld23,” has claimed in the comments that the program was a deepfake model hosted on developer platform GitHub. This program was “starred” by 46,300 other users before being disabled in August 2024 after the platform introduced rules banning projects for synthetically creating nonconsensual sexual images, aka deepfake porn. It became available again in November 2024 in an archived format, where users can still access the code.\nGitHub’s crackdown is incomplete, as the code—along with others taken down by the developer site—also persists in other repositories on the platform. A WIRED investigation has found more than a dozen GitHub projects linked to deepfake “porn” videos evading detection, extending access to code used for intimate image abuse and highlighting blind spots in the platform’s moderation efforts. WIRED is not naming the projects or websites to avoid amplifying the abuse.\n“It’s not easy to always remove something the moment it comes online,” says Henry Ajder, an AI adviser to tech companies like Meta and Adobe on the challenge of moderating open source material online. “At the same time, there were red flags that were pretty clear.”\nImplemented in June 2024, GitHub’s policy bans projects that are “designed for, encourage, promote, support, or suggest in any way the use of synthetic or manipulated media for the creation of nonconsensual intimate imagery or any content that would constitute misinformation or disinformation.”\nGitHub has disabled at least three repositories identified by WIRED in December 2024 and is clearly taking action on abusive code. But others have popped up elsewhere on the platform, including some with near-identical branding or clear descriptors as “NSFW,” “unlocked” versions, or “bypasses.”\n“We condemn using GitHub to post sexually obscene content and prohibit such conduct in our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policies,“ says Jesse Geraci, online safety counsel at GitHub. “GitHub conducts proactive screening for such content, in addition to actively investigating abuse reports, and we quickly take action where content violates our terms.”\nOne project identified by WIRED in December 2024 had branding almost identical to a major project—self-described as the “leading software for creating deepfakes”—which GitHub disabled for several months last year for violating its terms of service. GitHub has also since disabled this additional version.\n“It wasn’t hiding,” says Ajder. “It wasn’t particularly subtle.”\nHowever, an archived version of the major repository is still available, and at least six other repositories based on the model were present on GitHub as of January 10, including another branded almost identically.\nAll of the GitHub projects found by WIRED were at least partially built on code linked to videos on the deepfake porn streaming site. The repositories exist as part of a web of open source software across the web that can be used to make deepfake porn but by its open nature cannot be gate-kept. GitHub repos can be copied, known as a “fork,” and from there tailored freely by developers.\n“When we look at intimate image abuse, the vast majority of tools and weaponized use have come from the open source space,” says Ajder. But they often start with well-meaning developers, he says. “Someone creates something they think is interesting or cool and someone with bad intentions recognizes its malicious potential and weaponizes it.”\nSome, like the repository disabled in August, have purpose-built communities around them for explicit uses. The model positioned itself as a tool for deepfake porn, claims Ajder, becoming a “funnel” for abuse, which predominantly targets women.\nOther videos uploaded to the porn-streaming site by an account crediting AI models downloaded from GitHub featured the faces of popular deepfake targets, celebrities Emma Watson, Taylor Swift, and Anya Taylor-Joy, as well as other less famous but very much real women, superimposed into sexual situations.\nThe creators freely described the tools they used, including two scrubbed by GitHub but whose code survives in other existing repositories.\nPerpetrators on the prowl for deepfakes congregate in many places online, including in covert community forums on Discord and in plain sight on Reddit, compounding deepfake prevention attempts. One Redditor offered their services using the archived repository’s software on September 29. “Could someone do my cousin,” another asked.\nTorrents of the main repository banned by GitHub in August are also available in other corners of the web, showing how difficult it is to police open-source deepfake software across the board. Other deepfake porn tools, such as the app DeepNude, have been similarly taken down before new versions popped up.\n“There’s so many models, so many different forks in the models, so many different versions, it can be difficult to track down all of them,” says Elizabeth Seger, director of digital policy at cross-party UK think tank Demos. “Once a model is made open source publicly available for download, there’s no way to do a public rollback of that,” she adds.\nOne deepfake porn creator with 13 manipulated explicit videos of female celebrities credited one prominent GitHub repository marketed as a “NSFW” version of another project encouraging responsible use and explicitly asking users not to use it for nudity. “Learning all available Face Swap AI from GitHUB, not using online services,” their profile on the tube site says, brazenly.\nGitHub had already disabled this NSFW version when WIRED identified the deepfake videos. But other repositories branded as “unlocked” versions of the model were available on the platform on January 10, including one with 2,500 “stars.”\n“It is technically true that once [a model is] out there it can’t be reversed. But we can still make it harder for people to access,” says Seger.\nIf left unchecked, she adds, the potential for harm of deepfake “porn” is not just psychological. Its knock-on effects include intimidation and manipulation of women, minorities, and politicians, as has been seen with political deepfakes affecting female politicians globally.\nBut it’s not too late to get the problem under control, and platforms like GitHub have options, says Seger, including intervening at the point of upload. “If you put a model on GitHub and GitHub said no, and all hosting platforms said no, for a normal person it becomes harder to get that model.”\nReining in deepfake porn made with open source models also relies on policymakers, tech companies, developers and, of course, creators of abusive content themselves.\nAt least 30 US states also have some legislation addressing deepfake porn, including bans, according to nonprofit Public Citizen’s legislation tracker, though definitions and policies are disparate, and some laws cover only minors. Deepfake creators in the UK will also soon feel the force of the law after the government announced criminalizing the creation of sexually explicit deepfakes, as well as the sharing of them, on January 7.\nUpdate 1/21/25 9:40 am EST: This story has been updated to include a comment from GitHub.",

    "content_text": "The following is adapted from Gambling Man, my new biography of Masayoshi Son. As the Japanese founder and CEO of SoftBank, “Masa”—as he is known to friends and rivals alike—is probably the most powerful mogul of the 21st century who is not a household name. He was born in 1957 and grew up on the western island of Kyushu. Barely 5'5\", invariably dressed smart-casual, he lived for several years in California. Though his charm is legendary, he is easily bored. Visitors to his cavernous office in Tokyo, with its Putin-sized long table, can be given five minutes or two hours.\nMasa has been a software distributor, a dotcom investor, and a broadband and mobile phone operator. Now, through the SoftBank Vision Fund, he is the world’s largest venture investor. In the past two decades, he has invested in or controlled assets worth $1 trillion. This past December, he met with Donald Trump and pledged to invest $100 billion in the US.\nThere are a lot of stories about Masa (some told for the first time in the book): how he bankrolled Alibaba, China’s internet colossus, after a six-minute speed-dating session with Jack Ma; how he personally supersized hundreds of Silicon Valley startups; how he recruited ex-Googler Nikesh Arora with a $320 million remuneration package signed on a napkin. But my favorite might be this: how Masa plotted with Steve Jobs to take the iPhone global.\nAt the turn of the 21st century, Masa was the richest man in the world—for three days. After the dotcom crash, he lost 97 percent of his wealth. But he never abandoned his techno-optimism, launching a new broadband service in Japan under the Yahoo brand. His dream was to connect a mobile-phone operator to Yahoo broadband. That way, Japanese consumers could access data, images, and messages all on one digital device. The missing piece was a breakthrough consumer product to compete with his archrival, NTT Docomo, the dominant incumbent in Japan and the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. The man who supplied the answer was his old friend Steve Jobs.\nThe relationship between Masa and Jobs was a special one. Both were autocratic mavericks who possessed buckets of self-belief and an uncanny ability to anticipate the future. Both had a deep understanding of aesthetics, technology, and consumer behavior. Masa’s office in Tokyo once had 50 different telephone handsets mounted on a wall, allowing him to study each feature before deciding on SoftBank’s own product design. Masa loved to quote Jobs’ famous line from Apple’s 1997 Think Different advertising campaign: “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.”\nMasa first encountered Steve Jobs in the mid-1980s at the annual Comdex trade fair in Las Vegas. Sometime in the summer of 1998, they had their first serious conversation under a cherry tree at the Woodside, California, home of Larry Ellison, boss of the Oracle software group and a fellow Japanophile.\nEllison’s home was in fact more like a village, a compound of intricately fashioned wooden houses modeled after a Japanese emperor’s palace. The 23-acre estate took almost a decade to design and build, including a lake and a waterfall operated by an on-off switch. All the buildings were constructed without nails and had mud-plastered walls designed to withstand a 7.3 Richter-scale earthquake. In total, Ellison’s homage to Japanese culture and history was worth around $70 million.\nThe talk around the table that day was about crazy internet valuations in the stock market. But Masa and Jobs were more interested in what would happen after the dotcom bubble. “I said that I was focused on the internet—and he agreed the internet was the future,” Masa says. Both men grasped that a paradigm shift was coming. Movements in the Nasdaq were one thing; the advent of the networked world, in which Apple played a leading role as innovator and SoftBank the part of investor and operator, was quite another.\nApple was, by then, one of the world’s most valuable companies, with a suite of smash-hit products from Mac laptops to the iPod. Like Masa, Jobs was paranoid about rivals stealing his ideas. No Apple project was more top secret than the iPhone, the touchscreen smartphone that would sell billions and revolutionize personal communications.\nBy Masa’s account, on a visit to California, sometime in the summer of 2005, he showed Jobs his own sketch of a mobile-enabled iPod that had a large display and used the Apple operating system. The new device, he predicted, would be able to process data and images. Jobs pooh-poohed the idea but could not resist dropping hints about the iPhone.\nJobs: “Masa, don’t give me your shitty drawing. I have my own.”\nMasa: “Well, I don’t need to give you my dirty piece of paper, but once you have your product, give it to me for Japan.”\nJobs refused to reveal any more detail, but Masa spotted the flicker of a smile on the Apple boss’s face. After pressing him further, Masa wangled a follow-up meeting at Jobs’ Tudor-style country home in Palo Alto. At that meeting, Masa claims, Jobs agreed in principle to give SoftBank exclusive rights to distribute the iPhone in Japan. “Well, Masa, you are crazy,” said Jobs. “We have not talked to anybody, but you came to see me first. I’ll give it to you.”\nNothing was written down. There was no discussion of price or volume. Just a gentleman’s agreement, based on the assumption that Masa would have the financial wherewithal to build or acquire a mobile phone business. “It was super confidential. I never saw the product before it arrived in Japan [in 2008],” Masa claims. “Steve never even told me the name.”\nThe tale has a mythical quality. It assumes Jobs gave his word a full three years before Apple launched the iPhone in Japan. Yet that very promise may well have given Masa the confidence to buy Vodafone Japan, the British-owned “also-ran” that used football icon David Beckham in its marketing campaign. This was a highly leveraged deal—the biggest to date in Asia—but Masa gambled that he had a game-changing product in the pipeline. Whatever the precise chronology, Masa pulled off the distribution deal of the century, which enabled him to build a profitable consumer business in Japan, massively enhancing the SoftBank brand.\nOn March 17, 2006, Masa clinched his $17 billion deal to buy Vodafone Japan. Two weeks later, Jobs flew to Tokyo, where Masa challenged the Apple boss to uphold his end of the deal. “You didn’t give me anything in writing, but I made a $17 billion bet based on your word,” he said. “You had better feel a tiny bit of responsibility.” Jobs laughed and said, “Masa, you are a crazy guy. We will do what we discussed.”\nIn the spring of 2006 Masa was in an almighty hurry. Mobile phone users in Japan would soon be free to transfer their telephone numbers to rival operators. Unless SoftBank came out with a compelling new offer on price or product, it risked losing hundreds of thousands of customers to NTT Docomo and the number-two operator, KDDI.\nSteve Jobs was also racing against the clock. Three years earlier, he was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer, but he’d delayed opening his body for surgery, and the cancer had spread to his liver. From the day of his operation in October 2004, he knew he was living on borrowed time. In public, he insisted to colleagues and investors he was cured. In private, he was more focused than ever, devoting every hour to two secret projects, the iPhone and a new tablet computer called the iPad.\nApple launched its first iPhone, with low-capacity 2G technology, in the US in the summer of 2007. The device was incompatible with the more advanced technologies being used in Japan. For that reason, Japanese telecom giants saw Apple more as a designer and manufacturer of personal computers and music players. They couldn’t imagine the Americans producing a game-changing new consumer product in their space. By contrast, Masa grasped that Steve Jobs was about to become the disruptor-in-chief as faster technologies became ascendant not just in Japan but around the world.\nIn November 2007, the boss of AT&T, distributor of Apple’s 2G iPhone in the US, gave the game away. Speaking at the Churchill Club, a business event in Silicon Valley, Randall Stephenson let slip that Apple’s next iPhone would be 3G compatible. From then on, even as more than 2 million American consumers enjoyed a groundbreaking experience on a brilliant screen with a flick of their finger, the industry was abuzz with rumors of Apple’s next-generation product.\nWithin weeks, NTT Docomo’s CEO, Masao Nakamura, held talks with Jobs at Apple’s Cupertino headquarters, followed by Masa himself. This suggests that the exclusive iPhone distribution deal may not have been as watertight as Masa thought, though he later claimed that he was in regular touch with Jobs, exchanging ideas on features for the new iPhone. “I created all the characters, the emoticons that went in the iPhone,” he says. “I gave him many ideas.”\n(The claim is breathtaking, but Masa has always had an artistic bent. He is a decent amateur painter in the early Impressionist style. He also has a fine grasp of consumer behavior. How far Jobs listened to his Japanese friend is another matter.)\nBoth Masa and Docomo were desperate to get their hands on the new 3G-enabled product that was tri-band, operating on multiple networks and therefore capable of being rolled out all over the world. Docomo’s mobile phones operated on a 2-GHz network in Japan’s cities. Once in the countryside, where mobile phone towers were less prevalent, mobile users would flip to a more reliable “platinum band” 800‑MHz service. There was one drawback: NTT’s dual-band network had to be tested thoroughly to ensure the switch-over worked smoothly. The risk of a delayed iPhone rollout was therefore serious.\nBecause risk-averse Japanese regulators favored incumbents, SoftBank had to settle for the inferior 2.1-GHz spectrum, whose advantage was that it was single-band and nationwide, and therefore did not require a switchover.\nTechnology mattered, but personal chemistry counted even more. “There was a deep connection between Masa and Steve Jobs,” says Ron Fisher, SoftBank’s man in the US, who attended several meetings between the two men. “Jobs understood that when you are trying to change consumer behavior in a place like Japan, you need a maverick.”\nOn June 4, 2008, Masa announced that SoftBank would sell the iPhone, confirming he had beaten Docomo to the punch. The following month, SoftBank began distribution in Japan. By September 2011, when SoftBank lost its exclusivity over the iPhone, its market share had grown to 23 percent, up from 17 percent at the point when the mobile business was acquired from Vodafone. Steve Jobs’ decision to stake all on SoftBank was vindicated, but the success also pointed to Masa’s ability to scale up rapidly, overcoming a maze of logistical, regulatory, and marketing obstacles.\nThanks to the iPhone, Masa established SoftBank Mobile as the number one operator in Japan. This was the springboard for his acquisition of a controlling stake in Sprint in 2013, which later merged with T-Mobile, creating a third force in the US telecoms market. Along the way, he reverted from mobile operator to global tech investor. He snapped up Arm Holdings, the UK-based advanced chip designer, and tried to merge it with Nvidia, now the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia founder Jensen Huang remains a good friend and likes to remind Masa that he sold his 5 percent stake in 2019, missing out on an Alibaba-sized deal of a lifetime.\nMasa’s passion now is artificial general intelligence, whose impact, he believes, will exceed the microchip, the internet, and the mobile phone. “I have to be in this revolution,” he told me in our last interview in Tokyo. “I have to participate.”\nIn the summer of 2024, SoftBank invested $500 million in OpenAI. Before that, the Financial Times suggested that Masa was ready to put up $1 billion to develop “the iPhone of artificial intelligence” in partnership with Sam Altman and Jony Ive. This would be the first consumer device in the age of AI. If the vision comes off—and never write off Masayoshi Son—it would be a fitting legacy to his friendship and collaboration with his mentor-collaborator Steve Jobs.\nCopyright © 2025 by Lionel Barber.

    "content_text": "Four days before he leaves office, US president Joe Biden has issued a sweeping cybersecurity directive ordering improvements to the way the government monitors its networks, buys software, uses artificial intelligence, and punishes foreign hackers.\nThe 40-page executive order unveiled on Thursday is the Biden White House’s final attempt to kickstart efforts to harness the security benefits of AI, roll out digital identities for US citizens, and close gaps that have helped China, Russia, and other adversaries repeatedly penetrate US government systems.\nThe order “is designed to strengthen America’s digital foundations and also put the new administration and the country on a path to continued success,” Anne Neuberger, Biden’s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters on Wednesday.\nLooming over Biden’s directive is the question of whether president-elect Donald Trump will continue any of these initiatives after he takes the oath of office on Monday. None of the highly technical projects decreed in the order are partisan, but Trump’s advisers may prefer different approaches (or timetables) to solving the problems that the order identifies.\nTrump hasn’t named any of his top cyber officials, and Neuberger said the White House didn’t discuss the order with his transition staff, “but we are very happy to, as soon as the incoming cyber team is named, have any discussions during this final transition period.”\nThe core of the executive order is an array of mandates for protecting government networks based on lessons learned from recent major incidents—namely, the security failures of federal contractors.\nThe order requires software vendors to submit proof that they follow secure development practices, building on a mandate that debuted in 2022 in response to Biden’s first cyber executive order. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency would be tasked with double-checking these security attestations and working with vendors to fix any problems. To put some teeth behind the requirement, the White House’s Office of the National Cyber Director is “encouraged to refer attestations that fail validation to the Attorney General” for potential investigation and prosecution.\nThe order gives the Department of Commerce eight months to assess the most commonly used cyber practices in the business community and issue guidance based on them. Shortly thereafter, those practices would become mandatory for companies seeking to do business with the government. The directive also kicks off updates to the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s secure software development guidance.\nAnother part of the directive focuses on the protection of cloud platforms’ authentication keys, the compromise of which opened the door for China’s theft of government emails from Microsoft’s servers and its recent supply-chain hack of the Treasury Department. Commerce and the General Services Administration have 270 days to develop guidelines for key protection, which would then have to become requirements for cloud vendors within 60 days.\nTo protect federal agencies from attacks that rely on flaws in internet-of-things gadgets, the order sets a January 4, 2027, deadline for agencies to purchase only consumer IoT devices that carry the newly launched US Cyber Trust Mark label.\nAnother part of the order boosts CISA’s ability to watch for cyberattacks across the government by tapping into the security software that other agencies operate. It’s an attempt to reduce visibility gaps that adversaries have successfully exploited in many intrusions, especially the 2020 SolarWinds hack. The order requires agencies to give CISA direct access to their security platforms and to allow CISA to conduct unannounced threat-hunting activities on their networks.\n“If we find one particular technique that a foreign government is using to hack one particular federal agency,” Neuberger said, “this now … gives CISA centralized visibility to hunt across all agency systems to ensure we're defending against this attack broadly.”\nThe security risks and opportunities of AI play a major role in the executive order. The document directs the departments of Energy and Homeland Security to launch a pilot program to use AI to help protect energy infrastructure, with the goal of automating things like vulnerability detection and patching. The Defense Department would have to launch a program to use “advanced AI models” for cyber defense.\nBiden also wants DHS, Commerce, and the National Science Foundation to prioritize research on topics like how humans and AI tools can coordinate to analyze cyber threat data, how to ensure the security of AI-generated code, how to design secure AI models, and how to prevent and recover from cyber incidents involving AI systems.\nBiden’s order attempts to expedite agencies’ use of digital identity documents to streamline citizen services and reduce waste and fraud. The directive asks agencies to “consider accepting digital identity documents” as proof of eligibility for public benefits. Commerce would have 270 days to issue guidance to help agencies do so.\nOther provisions in the executive order require government recommendations for securing open-source software; updates to cyber requirements in contracts for space systems; contracting changes to ensure that new technology supports post-quantum cryptography; and the use of encryption in DNS technologies, email systems, and voice and video conferencing platforms. There is also a provision requiring OMB to help agencies reduce risks associated with concentration in the IT market—a not-so-veiled shot at Microsoft.\nThe order also lowers the bar for the government to be able to sanction people who launch cyberattacks on US critical infrastructure, potentially easing barriers to deploying one of Washington’s favorite responses to major hacks.",

    "content_text": "Today, the US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against farming equipment manufacturer Deere & Company—makers of the iconic green John Deere tractors, harvesters, and mowers—citing its longtime reluctance to keep its customers from fixing their own machines.\n“Farmers rely on their agricultural equipment to earn a living and feed their families,” FTC chair Lina Khan wrote in a statement alongside the full complaint. “Unfair repair restrictions can mean farmers face unnecessary delays during tight planting and harvest windows.”\nThe FTC’s main complaint here centers around a software problem. Deere places limitations on its operational software, meaning certain features and calibrations on its tractors can only be unlocked by mechanics who have the right digital key. Deere only licenses those keys to its authorized dealers, meaning farmers often can’t take their tractors to more convenient third-party mechanics or just fix a problem themselves. The suit would require John Deere to stop the practice of limiting what repair features its customers can use and make them available to those outside official dealerships.\nKyle Wiens is the CEO of the repair advocacy retailer iFixit and an occasional WIRED contributor who first wrote about John Deere’s repair-averse tactics in 2015. In an interview today, he noted how frustrated farmers get when they try to fix something that has gone wrong, only to run into Deere's policy.\n“When you have a thing that doesn’t work, if you’re 10 minutes from the store, it’s not a big deal,” Wiens says. “If the store is three hours away, which it is for farmers in most of the country, it’s a huge problem.”\nThe other difficulty is that US copyright protections prevent anyone but John Deere from making software that counteracts the restrictions the company has put on its platform. Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 makes it so people can’t legally counteract technological measures that fall under its protections. John Deere’s equipment falls under that copyright policy.\n“Not only are they being anti-competitive, it's literally illegal to compete with them,” Wiens says.\nDeere in the Headlights\nWiens says that even though there has been a decade of pushback against John Deere from farmers and repairability advocates, the customers using the company’s machines have not seen much benefit from all that discourse.\n“Things really have not gotten better for farmers,” Wiens says. “Even with all of the noise around a right to repair over the years, nothing has materially changed for farmers on the ground yet.”\nThis suit against Deere, he thinks, will be different.\n“This has to be the thing that does it,” Wiens says. “The FTC is not going to settle until John Deere makes the software available. This is a step in the right direction.”\nDeere’s reluctance to make its products more accessible has angered many of its customers, and even garnered generally bipartisan congressional support for reparability in the agricultural space. The FTC alleges John Deere also violated legislation passed by the Colorado state government in 2023 that requires farm equipment sold in the state to make operational software accessible to users.\n“Deere’s unlawful business practices have inflated farmers’ repair costs and degraded farmers’ ability to obtain timely repairs,” the suit reads.\nDeere & Company did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Instead, the company forwarded its statement about the FTC's lawsuit. The statement reads, in part: “Deere remains fully committed to ensuring that customers have the highest quality equipment, reliable customer service and that they, along with independent repair technicians, have access to tools and resources that can help diagnose, maintain and repair our customers’ machines. Deere’s commitment to these ideals will not waiver even as it fights against the FTC’s meritless claims.”\nElsewhere in the statement, Deere accused the FTC of \"brazen partisanship\" filed on the \"eve of a change in administration\" from chair Lina Khan to FTC Commissioner Andrew Ferguson. The company also pointed to an announcement, made yesterday, about an expansion to its repairability program that lets independent technicians reprogram the electronic controllers on Deere equipment.\nNathan Proctor, senior director for the Campaign for the Right to Repair at the advocacy group US PIRG, wrote a statement lauding the FTC’s decision. He thinks this case, no matter how it turns out, will be a positive step for the right to repair movement more broadly.\n“I think this discovery process will paint a picture that will make it very clear that their equipment is programmed to monopolize certain repair functions,” Proctor tells WIRED. “And I expect that Deere will either fix the problem or pay the price. I don’t know how long that is going to take. But this is such an important milestone, because once the genie’s out of the bottle, there’s no getting it back in.”\nUpdate, January 15 at 6:55 pm: This story was updated to include an excerpt from a statement Deere & Company forwarded to WIRED after we initially published the story.",

    "content_text": "Meta’s cascade of announcements this month on slashing diversity initiatives and relaxing hate-speech policies warned of a significant change in the lives of some of its employees. Teams that write and enforce rules for what can be posted on Instagram and Meta’s other services will be moved from California to Texas and other parts of the US to “help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, without elaborating.\nBut the actual number of employees that will have to relocate is limited, according to internal discussions described to WIRED by four current workers.\nLast Thursday during a town hall call for Meta employees working under Guy Rosen, the company’s chief information security officer, executives said that no one in Rosen’s organization would have to move to Texas, according to two people in attendance. This exempts from relocation employees who work on Meta's safety, operations, and integrity teams, which collectively help enforce the company's content policies.\nThe changes also do not affect a portion of Meta’s US-based content policy team, which works under chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan, because many members are already located outside of California, including in Washington, DC, New York City, and Austin, Texas, the employees say. That includes key decisionmakers such as Neil Potts, vice president of public policy. Many of the company’s content moderators are contractors based out of hubs beyond California such as San Antonio, Texas.\nFull-time employees who are asked to relocate from the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park will receive financial assistance to do so, according to one staffer familiar with the plans. Another described those that will be affected as “not a very big” team. It’s unclear whether some staffers located in Los Angeles will be subject to the moving order. Meta didn’t respond to requests for comment, including to specify how many contractors and employees based outside of Texas will be required to move.\nFor years, Republican politicians and other right-wing critics have claimed that Meta favors liberal voices on its platforms, while unfairly silencing minority opinions on issues such as vaccine safety and immigration. At times, blame for the alleged bias has been put on the notion that Meta’s decisionmakers are based in the San Francisco Bay Area, a liberal-leaning region where Donald Trump lost the vote in the past two presidential elections.\nWith Trump set to take office next week, Zuckerberg said he feels society has reached a cultural tipping point. “You got to do what you think is right,” he said last week on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during a nearly three-hour appearance that included a bathroom break. He started Meta to give people a voice, he said, and felt the company had drifted away from that mission in recent years. “I just have a much greater command now of what I think the policy should be, and, like, this is how it's going to be going forward,” he added. “We try to have policies that reflect mainstream discourse.”\nWhether shifting teams to Texas will be anything more than symbolic is unclear. Common sense suggests if a person in California exhibits some sort of political preference, moving them to Texas isn’t likely to reshape their viewpoints immediately.\nIn the same town hall call, company leadership described the Texas relocation as an attempt to address the perception problem with California. That reasoning frustrated employees, who believe Meta is harming its workforce to appease Trump, the three staffers told WIRED. Meta and Trump remain in litigation in a northern California federal court over the temporary suspension of his account following the January 6, 2021, riot on the US Capitol. Trump alleges his constitutional right to speech was violated. Zuckerberg recently met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida to mediate the lawsuit, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nThis week, Meta unveiled plans to cut 5 percent of its workforce starting in February. The company said it plans to refill those positions throughout the year—a move that could see more employees hired in Texas. After Meta's decision last week to shutter its diversity, equity and inclusion program, there will be no targets for hiring historically underrepresented groups.\nLast week’s changes to hateful conduct rules allow users to post more acerbic criticism, including about gender and ethnicity. During the Rogan podcast, Zuckerberg said users would now be able to advocate on issues such as whether they should serve in military combat roles. Some employees have warned that Meta is now supporting the spread of misogyny and bigotry on its services, according to two of the workers.\nOn the town hall call with employees, an executive defended the policy changes by saying they would open the door to a multitude of perspectives, such as being able to call men lazy on Facebook without fear of being censored, according to one employee in attendance.\nOn the enforcement side, Meta is winding down its current fact-checking program, limiting use of automated filters to suppress allegedly offensive posts, and promoting a greater amount of political content in newsfeeds.\nOn Tuesday, 12 civil rights advocacy groups that say they have advised Meta for years wrote to the company to express “grave concern” with the revised policies. “These changes are devastating for free expression because they will subject members of protected groups to more attacks, harassment, and harm, driving them off Meta’s services, impoverishing conversations, eliminating points of view, and silencing dissenting and oft-censored voices,” wrote the group, which includes the Center for Democracy & Technology, Human Rights Campaign, and the National Black Justice Collective.\nIn the security and integrity town hall, management would not commit to continuing to publish statistics about the gender and racial makeup of the company’s employees. “It’s capitulating in the worst way,” one says.\nIndividually some managers have told their teams that they plan to continue pushing for diverse hiring, according to three employees.\nAdditional reporting by Steven Levy.",

    "content_text": "As houses continue to burn in Los Angeles, officials have already started talking about rebuilding the city. “We’re going to rebuild this remarkable community and we’re going to come back,” California governor Gavin Newsom said in a call with President Biden on January 10. Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass added her own call for action. “We’re going to recover, and we’re going to rebuild and we’re going to rebuild better.”\nThe challenge facing the city is huge. An estimated 12,000 structures have been destroyed in the Palisades and Eaton fires, neither of which has been contained. At least 25 people have been killed by the blazes, which are on track to be the costliest wildfires in US history. But as the risk of devastating wildfires increases with climate change, the calls to rebuild Los Angeles raise a series of tricky questions: How and where to rebuild—and whether to rebuild at all.\nIn November 2018, the Camp Fire razed most of the northern Californian town of Paradise to the ground and killed 85 people. The population of Paradise is now just a third of its pre-fire levels, but the town is rebuilding in a way that residents hope will make future wildfires less devastating. “We’ve gone from fire suppression to that not even being possible once there’s an ignition,” says Dan Efseaff, who started working for Paradise Recreation and Park District about a year before the Camp Fire.\nOne way to lessen the spread and intensity of fires is to reduce the amount of flammable vegetation—often called “fuel”—through prescribed burns, cutting back shrubs, and allowing animals to graze. Forest trails can also give authorities access for fuel management, provide a break in vegetation that slows fires down and, as was the case in the Camp Fire, provide evacuation routes in an emergency.\nAs well as reducing fuel and introducing more forest trails, residents are also thinking about where new homes will be built and what surrounds them, says Efseaff. Rather than building homes that back directly onto wildland, the town is exploring the use of buffer zones—areas of managed land that distance homes from the highest-risk areas. The idea is that homes can be clustered closer inside these defensible areas, making them easier for fire-fighters to access and defend.\nParks can also be an important part of fire defense: Open spaces like managed parks contain much less fuel, slowing down fires and halting their spread. As the Camp Fire raged, some 80 to 120 Paradise residents sheltered under the pavilion at nearby Bille Park. Since the fire, Esfeaff’s crews have worked in the park removing shrubs and small trees that could spread fire into its taller trees. “We wanted to get rid of those not only from a fire-protection standpoint, but because it also makes the park feel safer,” he says.\nThere are all kinds of buffer zones, says Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist at UC Santa Barbara. Vineyards, golf courses, baseball fields, and public parks can all be used to provide an open, less flammable space between homes and more flammable vegetation, to attempt to stop and slow fires before they enter neighborhoods. Once fires spread into denser urban areas they become urban conflagrations with whole blocks in danger of going up in flames, as has been the case in northern and eastern Los Angeles.\nThe planners and residents working to rebuild Los Angeles won’t be starting from a blank slate, however. Existing roads, infrastructure, and plots of lands will all shape how the city is rebuilt. Some residents may want to immediately rebuild on the same plot of land, while some may be willing to sell their land to create a buffer zone.\nOn January 13, Mayor Bass issued an executive order that will expedite permits for rebuilding “like for like” and exempts these from reviews that would slow down the rebuilding process. Governor Newsom has also relaxed permitting rules under the California Environmental Quality Act in order to speed up rebuilding.\nExactly how LA then chooses to rebuild is a “social values question,” says Moritz. “It’s not so much of a science question any more. Shouldn’t we as a society be able to weigh in on where and how people are building or rebuilding, so it’s safer and has less of an impact from a public funding perspective down the road? Because a lot of these events will recur.”\nWildfires in California have grown larger and more damaging in recent years. Some 7.08 million acres burned in California between 2009 and 2018—more than double the area burned between 1979 and 1988. The number of fires encroaching into urban areas has gone up too. In the 10 years between 1979 and 1988 around 22,000 acres of burned land was within so-called wildland/urban interfaces—areas where housing is close to wildfire-prone nature. By 2009–2018 that increased to 32,000 acres.\nOne result of all this is that Californian authorities have good maps of high-risk areas. Many of the areas hit by the Palisades and Eaton fires were classified as very high fire hazard zones, which means new developments in these areas have to take steps to minimize the risk of fires spreading from wild vegetation into homes, including planting fire-resistant vegetation and keeping any other trees and shrubs trimmed and away from houses.\nBut housing demand is so high in cities like Los Angeles that developers often end up building in these very high fire-hazard zones anyway. After a wildfire, developers tend to slow down building in high-risk areas for a while, but after a couple of years they return to previous rates of development, says Nicholas Irwin, who studies real estate economics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\nCities and local authorities need to think about ways to discourage development in high-risk areas, says Irwin. One way would be to increase development taxes in areas prone to fires, but another would be to incentivize developers to infill—building more houses and apartments in underused urban areas.\n“We do need denser development, especially in places like Los Angeles. The property market there is out of control, and it’s going to be getting even worse,” he says. “We need to think about ways to rebuild that allow more units to be built to help affordability but also ways that are more resilient to future wildfire risks.”\nBurying power lines might also go a long way to defending houses against wildfire risks. The fire that destroyed Paradise was sparked by a power line fault, as were at least seven other of California’s most destructive wildfires. Burying power lines isn’t cheap, and those costs get passed on to utility customers, many of whom don’t live in areas at risk of wildfires.\n“It’s these little things that would make a difference in the long run,” says Irwin. Burying power lines, encouraging denser development, and building more defensible communities. But these long-term investments require changing how people think about living in wildfire risk zones and accepting that more resilient communities come at a cost. “I just don’t know if we’re going to learn anything,” says Irwin.",

    "content_text": "TikTok user aalamode’s handwriting loops across a manila envelope addressed to the president of China. “Sending Xi Jinping a data care package because he’s taken better care of me than the US government ever has,” reads the video’s superimposed text. The camera cuts to a young woman swabbing the inside of her cheek and ripping out a few strands of dark hair before it pans to a shot of her personal effects: passport with social security card tucked inside, a list of medications, a handwritten note reading “My Passwords (For Xi’s eyes only),” baby photos.\nAcross TikTok, users are jokingly addressing love letters, tributes, and thank yous to fictional Chinese spies. The ones, the meme goes, who pose the national security threat the US government aims to thwart with the looming TikTok ban, which is slated to go into effect on January 19.\n“If we don’t get to hang out anymore, I just want to thank you for the good times we had,” comedian Lisandra Vazquez says in one clip on the video-sharing site. “I just know it was you looking out for me and sending me those tarot readers telling me that he was no good for me.” In a different video, TikToker Gabriella Rose lugs a suitcase down a snowy sidewalk, back to the camera. “Me because I’d rather move to China than Instagram Reels,” the overlaid text says.\nThe end of TikTok in the United States is (most likely) nigh. But it’s TikTok users who are having the last laugh.\nLast Friday, the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments from the government and TikTok about the app’s fate. The government made its case that the court should uphold the ban, which was signed into law by President Biden last year and stipulates that Chinese owner ByteDance must sell TikTok’s US operations to domestic owners or be blocked. TikTok, of course, argued the opposite, citing the First Amendment.\nThe Supreme Court has yet to issue its decision, but experts believe it’s unlikely the court will side with the popular video-sharing app. It’s unclear whether TikTok will go dark on January 19 or fade away, yet its time on some 170 million Americans’ phones seems to be rapidly dwindling. Like a condemned building, US TikTok will likely fall apart little by little until it’s no longer hospitable.\nBut a win for the US government is the people’s loss, particularly as lawmakers have failed to meet this moment by adequately convincing citizens that TikTok needs to go. Sure, the app has Americans’ data—as do most apps created right here in the US. A security risk? The vibe seems to be “so what.” Americans aren’t just protesting the ban. They’re revolting, lining up to hand off their data to Chinese companies. Xiaohongshu, otherwise known as RedNote, has soared to the top of the charts; close on its heels is another app owned by TikTok parent company ByteDance, Lemon8.\nIn December, in a piece about Luigi Mangione and the “blackpilling” of America—a descent into disillusionment—Vox writer Rebecca Jennings described a general malaise settling over the masses: “All swaths of Americans increasingly appear to find themselves in a nihilistic mood …They’re disenchanted with the economy and feeling pessimistic about climate change, the dating market, and their own loneliness. They’re losing faith in nearly every major US institution, from the public school system to police departments, the military, unions, organized religion and, of course, the media.”\nThat feeling could also describe much of the attitude toward social media platforms in 2025. X, once considered the town square of the internet, is lousy with trolls, hate speech, and propaganda. Meta, seemingly following in X’s and Elon Musk’s footsteps, is rolling back fact-checking and hate speech protections on Facebook and Instagram at a breakneck pace. Social platforms are poised to become even more poisonous to their own users as a handful of outrageously rich and powerful men grapple with their own insecurities around masculinity and free speech.\nTikTok, in comparison, was not just another social platform. It was personalized, helpful even. I’ve been an avid TikToker for years; it’s a platform that taught me recipes, curly hair care, how to find financial resources, art tutorials, workout routines, plant care, and so much more. It’s had a more positive material influence on my life than any other platform, a feeling shared by many American users. Is that personal impact more important than listening to dry explanations from the government on foreign influence? Just ask the TikTokers now learning Mandarin as they migrate to RedNote.\nOther TikTok users are spending what appear to be the app’s final days saying goodbye. “To my Chinese spy watching me through my phone,” reads one, “I will miss you.” End times on the app are full of creators asking their audiences to follow them elsewhere, while also using every last second to dunk on their own country and its efforts to ban an app while much larger problems persist. “National fucking security risk?” user Bryan Andrews says in a video with 27 million views. “Yeah fucking right.”\nWe’re long past the days where TikTok was thought of as just that app where people posted lip syncs and dances. Today it’s a powerhouse, a finely tuned machine churning out memes, jokes, fashion trends, news, music, slang, and so much more faster than any modern social platform.\nTikTok’s success exists on both a macro and micro level, dictating both cultural trends and offering individuals the ability to curate a specific sort of lifestyle through a feed that constantly evolves based on your interests. It gave artists a better platform to have their work seen by people all over the world. It helped victims in war-torn countries get their message overseas. It created a new generation of small business owners, an incalculable number of people who were able to financially bootstrap themselves into better lives by building an audience.\nThe threat the US government claims TikTok poses holds little interest for the average American. Indeed, younger generations have always existed in a highly online world where their privacy has been exposed, sometimes since birth. As TikTok user crutches_and_spice put it: “I don’t fucking care that China has my data! Are you joking? Everybody has my data.”",

    "content_text": "The Biden administration this week introduced new export restrictions designed to control AI’s progress globally and ultimately prevent the most advanced AI from falling into China’s hands. The rule is just the latest in a string of measures put in place by Donald Trump and Joe Biden to keep Chinese AI in check.\nWith prominent AI figures including OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Anthropic’s Dario Amodei warning of the need to “beat China” in AI, the Trump administration may well escalate things further.\nPaul Triolo is a partner at DGA Group, a global consulting firm, a member of the council of foreign relations, and a senior adviser to the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Project on the Future of US-China Relations. Alvin Graylin is an entrepreneur who previously ran China operations for the Taiwanese electronics firm HPC. Together they have been tracking China’s AI industry and the impact of US sanctions. In an email exchange, Triolo and Graylin discussed the latest sanctions, Silicon Valley rhetoric, and the dangers of seeing global AI as a zero sum game.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\nWhat do you make of the new AI diffusion rule from the US government this week, which aims to curb China’s access to AI?\nPaul Triolo: Generally, it focuses on clusters of high-performance computing. The rule also puts controls on proprietary model weights for the most advanced “frontier” models but it is unclear how performance levels will be determined, and most open-weight [freely shared] AI models are tuned and improved by users, including major AI companies in China.\nThe complex rule and unclear compliance conditions inject considerable uncertainty into the long-term plans of both medium and major US and western hyperscalers.\nFor hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, AWS, and Oracle, the rule introduces critical issues, including slowed or more complex international expansion, new compliance and legal costs, impact on global R&D, and uncertain enforcement requirements.\nHow have previous measures, including the sanctions introduced by the first Trump administration, affected the AI industry there?\nPaul Triolo: US export controls have slowed China, but at a high level the sanctions have unified the will and efforts of the Chinese government to become more self-reliant. It has plowed tens of billions into helping local players catch up technologically or scale capacity in core areas, resulting in significant changes within the semiconductor industry and its ability to support the advanced hardware for developing frontier AI models.\nChinese AI developers have gotten very good at leveraging legacy AI hardware from western firms and gradually integrating domestic alternatives into their development process. Chinese firms will continue to innovate across the AI hardware and software stack, if not at the pace of their western counterparts.\nWhy do you think so many in Silicon Valley are now talking about the need to “beat China” in AI?\nPaul Triolo: There is a growing link between conservative venture capitalists, mostly located in Silicon Valley, and technology companies whose business models depend on hyping the China threat. This is a troubling combination that conflates the China threat, personal gain, and push back against regulation of advanced AI. It also portrays US China competition around AI as zero sum, which is particularly dangerous.\nThe Trump administration will be heavily influenced by this zero sum narrative, given the prominent role that will be played by technology leaders and venture capitalists. Already key players in the AI space with close ties to the US government such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have written op-eds or made comments or approved company statements that align with the China AI threat framing and zero sum competition.\nIt is likely that Elon Musk will push back on this narrative. He has already called for international cooperation and responsible AI governance. And he has voiced concerns about AI safety, which he believes must be addressed on a global basis, including through engagement with China.\nShouldn’t the US want to beat China?\nAlvin Graylin: This type of framing suggests that any collaboration between the US and China, even in areas such as medicine and energy development, should be avoided in the name of ensuring the “dominance” of the US and allies in the development of AI. In truth it is impossible for either country to maintain a sustainable lead over the other and “win” this race.\nThe dominant paradigm driving US policy on China and AI is the assumption of future conflict, and this comes with the still fuzzy notion that AI will be decisive in both economic and military domains. Officials have, however, struggled to identify the exact “significant military applications” that are of concern.\nOn the other hand, collaborative research has proven critical to fundamental progress for AI in recent decades. Almost half of all top AI researchers globally (47 percent) were born or educated in China, according to industry studies. Breaking this virtuous cycle appears risky and counterproductive, but the trend lines are in this direction. Another major risk is that China pulls out of multilateral efforts to develop an AI governance framework, making it impossible to have a workable global arrangement for AI safety.\nHow much of a lead does the US actually have?\nAlvin Graylin: The Silicon Valley consensus on AI previously held that the US had a one or two year lead over China in AI development.\nSome popular generative video and photo models from China now appear to be as good as leading US offerings. The recent release of the surprisingly competent DeepSeek r1 and v3 models, which outperform the most advanced OpenAI o1 reasoning and GPT4o models respectively, seems to indicate that gap is actually closing. A pivot to inference compute [used when running models rather than training them], which is less reliant on chips fabricated with the most advanced semiconductor nodes, is nullifying the sanctions. What’s most impressive is that DeepSeek was only founded in 2023 and has less than 100 staff and much more limited computing resources than the western frontier labs.\nThe technology controls the US government has been imposing on China is actually forcing Chinese developers to become more creative and efficient with resources than their western counterparts. China may also have advantages in accessing the private data that will be needed to train frontier models. With today’s national policies limiting access to data from each country to others, we are heading down a very dark path where we can potentially have 193 ultra-intelligent “sovereign AI” models each limited to a certain culture and values. This is great for the Nvidia stock price, but a dystopian nightmare for humanity.\nWhat advice would you give to the incoming president and his staff?\nPaul Triolo: The escalating AI competition between the US and China poses significant threats not only to both nations but also to the entire world. They could lead to outcomes that threaten global peace, economic stability, and technological progress.\nThe US and China nations need to recalibrate their approach to AI development, and move away from viewing AI primarily as a military asset. They should also establish a robust dialogue for the development of common AI governance standards and support the development of a global AI safety coalition. Both nations should also agree on shared standards for the responsible use of AI and collaborate on tools that can monitor and counteract misuse globally. Governments worldwide should provide incentives for academic and industry collaborations across borders. A global effort akin to the CERN for AI will bring much more value to the world and a peaceful end than a Manhattan Project for AI, which is being promoted by many on the Hill today.\nOur choice is stark but simple: proceed down a path of confrontation that will almost certainly lead to mutual harm, or to pivot towards collaboration, which offers the potential for a prosperous and stable future for all.\nDo you think the US should stop trying to slow China's AI advancements?

The rule also puts controls on proprietary model weights for the most advanced “frontier” models but it is unclear how performance levels will be determined, and most open-weight [freely shared] AI models are tuned and improved by users, including major AI companies in China.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The complex rule and unclear compliance conditions inject considerable uncertainty into the long-term plans of both medium and major US and western hyperscalers.</p><p class=\"paywall\">For hyperscalers like Google, Microsoft, AWS, and Oracle, the rule introduces critical issues, including slowed or more complex international expansion, new compliance and legal costs, impact on global R&amp;D, and uncertain enforcement requirements.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>How have previous measures, including the sanctions introduced by the first Trump administration, affected the AI industry there?</strong></p><p class=\"paywall\">Paul Triolo: US export controls have slowed China, but at a high level the sanctions have unified the will and efforts of the Chinese government to become more self-reliant. It has plowed tens of billions into helping local players catch up technologically or scale capacity in core areas, resulting in significant changes within the semiconductor industry and its ability to support the advanced hardware for developing frontier AI models.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Chinese AI developers have gotten very good at leveraging legacy AI hardware from western firms and gradually integrating domestic alternatives into their development process. Chinese firms will continue to innovate across the AI hardware and software stack, if not at the pace of their western counterparts.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Why do you think so many in Silicon Valley are now talking about the need to “beat China” in AI?</strong></p><p class=\"paywall\">Paul Triolo: There is a growing link between conservative venture capitalists, mostly located in Silicon Valley, and technology companies whose business models depend on hyping the China threat. This is a troubling combination that conflates the China threat, personal gain, and push back against regulation of advanced AI. It also portrays US China competition around AI as zero sum, which is particularly dangerous.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "More than 15 years after Apple first opened the doors of its App Store, it’s now well established that there’s at least one app (and usually several dozen) for just about everything. That includes managing our time better.\nWith each passing year, life only seems to get busier, as commitments and responsibilities pile up on top of hobbies and careers, and our lists of family and friends just grow and grow. You've got a whole host of options when it comes to trying to tame the chaos, but sometimes all you need is a better idea of where each day's 24 allotted hours are going.\nThat's where these apps are able to help. They vary to some extent in their features and in their approach, but they're all designed to help you keep track of your responsibilities in a way that doesn't waste your time. Once you've got a better understanding of what you need to fit into your schedule, you can do something about making it more organized—and maybe even freeing up some precious hours.\nToggl Track\nToggl Track excels in enabling you to quickly assign blocks of time to certain tasks and projects, without overcomplicating the process—and then producing some comprehensive reports on how your time's been split. Everything is automatically synced between devices, so you can jump between phone and laptop without a hitch.\nIn fact, there are a number of automatic time-tracking options available on the desktop (in your browser, for example), so you don't need to remember to start and stop the timers. Before long, you've got a daily and weekly breakdown of what you've done, across categories you can customize as needed: Family, work, leisure, or whatever you like.\nIt's an app primarily designed for freelancers and contractors, with time slots attached to earnings, but it's perfectly possible to use it for personal timekeeping too. The app is free to use across devices, with unlimited time tracking. If you need more features, including more options for billable rates and report types, paid plans start at $10 per month.\nClockify\nClockify has a busy interface that may look daunting at first, but it really doesn't take long to find your way around and get comfortable with the apps for mobile and desktop. It's comprehensive enough to work for businesses, but it works fine for individuals too and is particularly helpful if you need to track working hours in detail.\nTracking time across multiple devices and the web couldn't be any simpler, whether you want to press Start and Stop buttons as you go through your day or fill out blocks of time manually. Your time can be split into different projects and have different tags attached, which lets you see which blocks of time are linked to which work or nonwork activities.\nOnce you've built up some stats, there are a number of useful reports you use to get a breakdown of how you spent your time. There is a standard calendar view too. The app makes a lot of its features available for free, but you can opt to pay ($5 a month and up) to get more customization options and features, like the ability to split times and add breaks.\nTimelines\nTimelines is well worth looking at for your time-tracking solution, as long as you're using an iPhone or an iPad—it's not available for Android or the desktop. If you do want to log time using a mobile Apple device, then you'll find this a flexible, intuitive option, which mostly sticks to the basics in terms of features but does all of them well.\nAll you have to do to get started is tap the Add Timeline button: Your “timelines” can be socializing, working, relaxing, studying, or whatever you like. Then you simply start and stop timers as needed, and the app gives you reports as you go. You can also set goals for how much of something (like exercise) you want to log during a day, a week, or a month.\nThe app quickly builds up a comprehensive picture of how you're spending your time, without overwhelming you with different screens and features. You can get started with Timelines for free, with extra features—such as multi-device syncing, long-term trend reporting, and unlimited time tracking categories—available for $4 per month.\nSimple Time Tracker\nHaving mentioned an app exclusive to iPhones and iPads, it's only fair we mention an app you can only get on Android. Simple Time Tracker, as its name suggests, tries to stay out of the way as much as possible when it comes to monitoring where your time goes. You can get time slots started and stopped with a tap, and everything in the app is well laid out.\nThere's a lot to dig into here beyond the basics. Different activities (like reading or playing sports) can also be split into different categories (like work or fun) and customized with their own colors and icons. You can set goals for yourself to meet certain time thresholds and get reports in real time of how the hours in your day are being spent.\nThe app works really well in the way it lets you choose how simple or detailed your time tracking gets. You can really dig into individual days and timings if you want, or stick to a broader overview. Perhaps best of all, the app is completely open source and free to use, though I'd recommend sending a donation to the developer if you find the app helpful.",

    "content_text": "Should I set up a personal AI agent to help with my daily tasks?\n—Searching for Assistance\nAs a general rule, I think relying on any kind of automation in your daily life is dangerous when taken to the extreme and potentially alienating even when used in moderation, especially with regards to personal interactions. An AI agent that organizes my task list and gathers online links for further reading? Fabulous. An AI agent that automatically messages my parents every week with a quick life update? Horrific.\nThe strongest argument for not involving more generative AI tools into your daily routine, however, remains the environmental impact these models continue to have during training and output generation. With all of that in mind, I dug through WIRED’s archive, published during the glorious dawn of this mess we call the internet, to find more historical context for your question. After searching for a bit, I came back convinced you’re likely already using AI agents every single day.\nThe idea of AI agents, or God-forbid “agentic AI,” is the current buzzword du jour for every tech leader who’s trying to hype their recent investments. But the concept of an automated assistant dedicated to completing software tasks is far from a fresh idea. So much of the discourse around “software agents” in the 1990s mirrors the current conversation in Silicon Valley, where leaders at tech companies now promise an incoming flood of generative AI-powered agents trained to do online chores on our behalf.\n“One problem I see is that people will question who is responsible for the actions of an agent,” reads a WIRED interview with MIT Media Lab professor Pattie Maes, originally published in 1995. “Especially things like agents taking up too much time on a machine or purchasing something you don't want on your behalf. Agents will raise a lot of interesting issues, but I'm convinced we won't be able to live without them.”\nI called Maes early in January to hear how her perspective on AI agents has changed over the years. She’s as optimistic as ever about the potential for personal automation, but she’s convinced that “extremely naive” engineers are not spending enough time addressing the complexities of human-computer interactions. In fact, she says, their recklessness could induce another AI winter.\n“The way these systems are built, right now, they're optimized from a technical point of view, an engineering point of view,” she says. “But, they're not at all optimized for human-design issues.” She focuses on how AI agents are still easily tricked or resort to biased assumptions, despite improvements to the underlying models. And a misplaced confidence leads users to trust answers generated by AI tools when they shouldn’t.\nTo better understand other potential pitfalls for personal AI agents, let’s break the nebulous term into two distinct categories: those that feed you and those that represent you.\nFeeding agents are algorithms with data about your habits and tastes that search through swaths of information to find what’s relevant to you. Sounds familiar, right? Any social media recommendation engine filling a timeline with tailored posts or incessant ad tracker showing me those mushroom gummies for the thousandth time on Instagram could be considered a personal AI agent. As another example from the ’90s interview, Maes mentioned a news-gathering agent fine-tuned to bring back the articles she wanted. That sounds like my Google News landing page.\nThe issue with relying too much on this kind of AI agent is the slow burn of complacency. As more of the content I consume is fetched for me through personalized recommendation algorithms, I will likely make increasingly monotonous decisions and stumble upon fewer surprises. If I used an AI agent to compile my list of groceries every week and shop online through a delivery service, I’d enjoy the streamlined process at first, but probably would be less inclined through repetition to experiment with new dishes. Life becomes an exercise in creeping blandness.\nAs for AI agents that represent you, they are also mere algorithms, but these are designed to learn your behavior and mimic it, acting on your behalf during online interactions. It’s the fantasy of a digital twin that can attend video meetings for you, write thank you notes to your wedding guests, and call a restaurant to reserve you a table. This also includes generative AI tools made to impersonate famous people and auto-interact with their fans.\nI’d avoid these AI replicas at all costs, whether deploying one or interacting with one. The digital world has eclipsed the physical world in importance, and our lives are now largely mitigated through screens. Even if the tech is eventually good enough that sending an AI agent to FaceTime my grandma or letting it loose in the group chat to riff with my friends doesn’t feel like a laughable idea, let’s leave the automation to the dull tasks. We should show up as ourselves in online interactions. It’s increasingly all we have left.",

    "content_text": "Next time you’re checking sports news online, double-check the URL.\nFor instance, a headline like “Red Sox Urged to Risk Passing on Alex Bregman in Favor of $427 Million Superstar” looks ordinary enough—and it seems, at first glance, to come from BBC Sports. But on closer inspection you may be on a knock-off called “BBCSportss,” and the copy has been lifted from Sports Illustrated. Elsewhere on that site you’ll also find stories that aren’t stolen directly from another writer but instead read like a garbled remix of what other sports bloggers have written and appear to be AI-generated.\nDoubleVerify, a software platform tracking online ads and media analytics, recently conducted an analysis of a collection of over 200 websites filled with a mixture of seemingly AI-generated content and snippets of news articles cribbed from actual media outlets. According to the analysis, these sites often chose their domain names and designed their websites to mimic those operated by established media brands, including ESPN, NBC, Fox, CBS, and the BBC. Many of these ersatz sites look like legitimate sports news offerings.\n“We did not approve the ‘BBC Sportss’ content, and it is in fact plagiarized,” says Sports Illustrated spokesperson Paige Graham.\n“We’re seeing the velocity of fraud schemes double or triple year on year,” says DoubleVerify’s chief marketing officer, Dan Slivjanovski. Much of that fraud focuses on bots consuming content rather than creating it, driving up pageviews on websites to rack up unearned ad revenue by making it look like an uptick in human readers. But DoubleVerify has also observed a jump in schemes involving AI click farms, in which networks of websites are stuffed with AI-generated content designed to siphon both real readers and ad revenue away from real outlets.\nDoubleVerify observed that this ring, which it calls “Synthetic Echo,” appeared to either copy content from other websites, use AI-generated stories, or a mixture of both. “It’s not even fake news. It’s just random slop,” says Gilit Saporta, who runs the company’s fraud lab. While this isn’t the only slop scheme Saporta has observed, she sees this one as especially notable for how obviously interconnected many of its offerings appeared, often carrying the same web design choices from one site to the next.\nWIRED asked deepfake detection startup Reality Defender to analyze a sampling of websites from three of the Synthetic Echo domains. Looking at recent articles from “NBC Sportz,” it determined that the content was written by humans, but stolen from legitimate media sites, with bylines stripped and attributed instead to “nbcsportz.”\nOne such website ripped off in this way was the Detroit Free Press, which confirmed that it had not authorized republishing its writers’ work. “This content was not licensed by the Detroit Free Press and does not represent our brand or journalism,” says Detroit Free Press spokesperson Lark-Marie Antón. The company plans to take legal action.\nFor the two other domains Reality Defender tested, NBCSport.co.uk and BBCSportss.co.uk, all of the sample stories came back as likely AI-generated, corroborating DoubleVerify’s findings.\nNBC Sportz did not respond to requests for comment. Neither NBCSport.co.uk nor BBCSportss.co.uk has an email address or other contact information publicly associated with it, so WIRED had no way of making contact. (All three websites were registered by the domain management company Namecheap, as was a site imitating CBS News that DoubleVerify suspects of being within the Synthetic Echo network.)\nBad actors have attempted to piggyback off successful media outlets by republishing their work without permission for many years. Now, though, AI tools allow for variations on this scheme to proliferate at a newly accelerated pace. “This kind of low-quality content isn’t really new,” says Saporta. “But it’s so much easier to replicate and scale with these current tools.”\nThe number of AI slop websites has sharply increased year over year since generative AI tools exploded in popularity in 2023. Last February, shortly after WIRED first began reporting on the rise of AI content mills, media watchdog company NewsGuard had identified 725 “news and information sites” filled with AI content. By January 2025, it had identified at least 1,150 of these sites.\n“The volume has gone up,” says Shouvik Paul, chief operations officer of the AI detection company Copyleaks. “A lot of these are foreign-operated, and very shady operations, so how do you even keep up?”\nTo make matters more confusing for readers, a number of mainstream media sites have experimented with publishing AI-generated news articles. (Sports Illustrated itself ran allegedly AI-generated content, which its parent company has said was provided by a third party.) In other cases, domain-name hustlers have purchased the URLs of media properties that have fallen on hard times and resurrected them as AI content mills, sometimes replacing their previously sound journalism with robotic pablum.\nSome of these sites are already enkindling real-world confusion; in October, an SEO content mill posted an AI-generated announcement for a Halloween parade in Dublin, Ireland. Even though there was no such event planned, throngs of revelers showed up expecting festivities.\nCopyleaks’ Paul described the way that some of these websites glommed onto the brand identity of real outlets to peddle junk as “sort of like phishing.” In some cases, these sites appear to be making actual phishing efforts. One of the sites within the ring DoubleVerify identified was designed to imitate a Fox news outlet based in Nigeria. It greets would-be readers with a series of suspicious pop-up ads for software.\nWhile the pop-ups look bogus, the websites in this group do appear to do a brisk business in programmatic ads, which are advertisements placed through large-scale automated ad buys rather than a direct relationship between particular websites and advertisers. Many feature an abundance of banners administered by popular programmatic ad servers like Criteo and Sharethrough. (Neither Criteo nor Sharethrough responded to requests for comment.) DoubleVerify’s report suggests that the Synthetic Echo operators chose sports as one of the lead content categories specifically because it’s considered more brand-safe than hard news.\nProgrammatic ads from a number of prominent companies, including tech stalwarts like Asana and Oracle, ecommerce bigwig Net-A-Porter, makeup giant Sephora, and resort chain Kalahari Resorts, appeared while WIRED was monitoring these websites. None of these companies responded to requests for comment.\nAt a moment when trust in media has plummeted and many news outlets have seen revenue decline, this type of slop content mill ring is a double whammy. It pollutes the information ecosystem with junk and stolen writing, and it siphons off programmatic advertising revenue from legitimate content producers.",

    "content_text": "In one of the internet's stranger fringes, a unicorn with human breasts, a cheetah smoking a cigarette, and an animated Elon Musk in a traditional cloak sit cheek-by-jowl—the cast of a bad trip. A Word Art banner tops the page, a floating anachronism. Icons glitter, shimmy, bounce, and in other ways evade the chasing eye. Barely legible messages flick up in green, red and yellow, then vanish.\nYet beneath this belch of Internet weirdness and low-fi web design lies one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency businesses ever: Pump.Fun, a platform for launching memecoins, a type of crypto coin whose value rises and falls in line with the popularity of the memes it references.\nThe platform went live in January 2024. In the 12 months since, it has been reported by third parties to have brought in more than $350 million in revenue through a 1 percent cut of trades.\nPump.Fun is the creation of three entrepreneurs in their early twenties: Noah Tweedale, Alon Cohen, and Dylan Kerler. The trio began as memecoin traders themselves, but grew tired of repeatedly falling victim to rug pulls—a type of scam whereby a coin issuer steals away with funds, leaving investors sitting on worthless tokens.\n“Buying into memecoins was a very unsafe thing to do … Everything was designed to suck money out of people,” Tweedale told WIRED in an interview late last year. “The idea with Pump was to build something where everyone was on the same playing field.”\nThe three Pump.Fun cofounders, who met in England, have attempted to keep their identities a secret—Tweedale and Cohen continue to go publicly by their respective online pseudonyms, Sapijiju and A1on, while Kerler has little public association with Pump.Fun. But their names surfaced last year in corporate documents tied to the operation.\nTweedale agreed to meet with WIRED, but only on the condition that the whereabouts and details of his appearance remain undisclosed. When we met, he came across as earnest but somewhat on-edge—and he spoke at a mile a minute. He declined to answer questions about where the Pump.Fun operation is based or how many people it employs.\nThe secrecy is partly a reflection of an attitude common in the cryptosphere that the right to privacy is sacred, Tweedale claims. But it’s also about “personal security and safety,” he says. In theory, the amount of crypto passing through Pump.Fun wallets could make the team a target for would-be extortionists.\nThe intention is for the founders to become more public-facing in the future, Tweedale claims. But in the meantime, there is the matter of how best to reinvest the money that Pump.Fun has made to both harden and expand the platform in the face of increased scrutiny and inevitable growing pains. “We’re not here to make a quick buck, close down the website, and run away. We want to build something that lasts,” says Tweedale.\nThe long-term vision, he claims, is to transform Pump.Fun from a one-dimensional memecoin launchpad into a competitor to the largest social platforms, but where the lion’s share of revenues flow to users and creators. “Imagine Instagram or TikTok, where everything is investible,” says Tweedale. “The Pump UI—everything we have so far—is the earliest possible version of what you can imagine we want to do.”\nBefore Pump.Fun, relatively few memecoins came to market; only Dogecoin, the original memecoin, and a handful of others—like Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Bonk—achieved any sort of prominence. The complexity of developing a memecoin and the cost of supplying the liquidity necessary to make it easily tradable limited the amount that were released.\nBy combining a piece of mathematical flair called a bonding curve with a straightforward user interface, Pump.Fun made it possible for anybody to launch a memecoin instantly, at no cost. It also standardized the underlying code, which prevented developers from building in malicious mechanisms to steal funds, in what’s known as a hard rug pull.\nThe result was an explosion in the number of memecoins. Since Pump.Fun launched, more than 5.5 million unique memecoins have been published through the platform. “I knew it was going to work on the first day we launched. I could just see from the Twitter activity,” says Tweedale.\nThere is nothing particularly sophisticated about the way Pump.Fun works, says Zach Hamilton, founder of crypto startup Sarcophagus and venture partner at VC firm Hinge Capital. “None of the ideas are new. You could start a new Pump.Fun in an afternoon,” he says. Competitors have since come to market with near-identical platforms—among them Seipex, SunPump, and LMAO.\nBut the Pump.Fun cofounders were the first, says Hamilton, to figure out how to tear down the barrier to entry to creating new crypto coins—and the platform remains orders of magnitude larger than its challengers. “They took things off the shelf and put them together in the right way, at the right time,” he says.\nThe rise of Pump.Fun was also catalyzed by a financial nihilism taking hold among younger people, who are turning to riskier investments as a route to a prosperity unavailable to them through conventional means, argues Rennick Palley, founding partner at investment firm Stratos. Though many people lose money trading memecoins, which are notoriously volatile, a few have made a lot—and fast.\n“People want to own a house and have a family. They find that the existing financial system doesn’t serve them, so they decide that betting on memecoins is the only way to deploy capital in a way that could be meaningful in their life,” says Palley.\nThe vast majority of memecoins launched through Pump.Fun wind up nearly worthless, but the chance at outsized returns is irresistible to younger investors, says Cosmo Jiang, general partner and portfolio manager at crypto investment firm Pantera Capital.\n“There’s a shift towards shorter-term gambling as opposed to investing; people want to make it in one trade,” says Jiang. “It’s almost economically rational [to bet on memecoins], even if the expected value is negative, because it could put you in a different social and economic tier.\"\nThough relatively few sophisticated institutional investors have traded in memecoins to date, Jiang believes that venture capitalists—some of whom have criticized memecoins as unserious and potentially damaging to the reputation of the broader cryptosphere—should take the businesses that form around this newly thriving market seriously.\n“I’d be happy to invest in a casino, but not to sit at the blackjack table. I think of the memecoins themselves as like sitting at the blackjack table,” says Jiang.\nBecause of the platform’s juvenile spirit, Pump.Fun is easily dismissed. But its performance puts it in rarefied company; Pump.Fun is estimated to be on track to make more than $1 billion in revenue in 2025. “If this were any other business in the tech world, it would have a valuation of $10 billion or $20 billion,” says Palley. “Pump.Fun has solidified itself as one of the critical pieces of the memecoin industrial complex.”\nFor all of its financial success, Pump.Fun has suffered its share of travails, arising mostly from an apparent operational immaturity. According to website snapshots captured by the Wayback Machine, Pump.Fun only published its terms of service and privacy policy—basic necessities for any business—in late November, by which time hundreds of millions of dollars had already passed through the platform. “There are certainly a lot of reasons to believe that many of these [memecoin launchpad] platforms have some growing up to do,” says Jiang.\nIn May of last year, Pump.Fun employee Jarett Dunn allegedly exploited his administrative privileges to drain money held in escrow on the platform, leading users to incur nearly $2 million in losses. Three months later, Dunn pleaded guilty in a UK court after being accused of, among other charges, fraud by abuse of position, before stating he’d like to withdraw the plea. Dunn is scheduled to present his justification for changing the plea at a hearing in February, he told WIRED over email. (The affected Pump.Fun users have since been compensated, the platform claims.)\nMeanwhile, Pump.Fun was starting to become a locus for ethically dubious trading activity, in spite of its founding objective to shield memecoin investors. In particular, the platform has found it impossible to protect against soft rug pulls, whereby somebody creates a new crypto token, promotes it online, then sells off their entire holdings, sinking its price. The rise of Pump.Fun has coincided with an increase in the volume of this kind of tactic, according to crypto security company Blockaid.\nIn November, a child livestreamed himself on Pump.Fun pulling off what appeared to be a soft rug pull, flipping two middle fingers to the webcam as he walked away with tens of thousands of dollars. At the time Tweedale declined to comment on the incident, but told WIRED that Pump.Fun plans to introduce age restrictions.\n“People say there’s a bunch of different stuff you can do to block soft rug pulls—maybe a sell tax or lock up the people who create the coin. Truthfully, all of this is very easy to manipulate,” says Tweedale. “We are actively looking for ways to protect users.”\nShortly thereafter, facing a groundswell of criticism, the platform suspended its popular livestreaming feature. To peacock for attention in an overcrowded market, people reported on X, coin creators were livestreaming themselves performing dangerous, sexually degrading, and potentially illegal acts. In two particular cases, creators supposedly threatened to hang themselves and commit acts of violence live on Pump.Fun. Tweedale did not respond to a request for comment about these incidents.\n“To ensure the absolute safety of our users, we will be pausing the live streaming functionality on the site for an indefinite time period until the moderation infrastructure is ready to deal with the heightened levels of activity,” a notice posted to Pump.Fun’s website stated.\nThese shenanigans have awoken regulators to the memecoin phenomenon, which could create new compliance headaches for Pump.Fun and put the brakes on its madcap expansion.\nIn December, the UK Financial Conduct Authority issued a warning against Pump.Fun: “This firm may be providing or promoting financial services or products without our permission. You should avoid dealing with this firm and beware of scams,” the notice read. In response, Pump.Fun blocked UK residents from accessing the platform.\nBecause memecoins do not compare neatly with traditional financial assets, others suspect that gambling regulators—as opposed to financial watchdogs—will seek to govern the memecoin market in the near future. “It is basically unregulated gambling. It’s going to probably come down to the purview of whoever the regulator of gambling is in each country,” says Robert Le, a crypto analyst at market data company PitchBook.\nPump.Fun declined to comment on the prospect that memecoin trading could be regulated as gambling. But the founders are sensitive to the criticisms of the platform and the need to further professionalize the operation in line with its rapid growth and newfound prominence.\n“I want to stress, we don’t want people to lose money on our platform. It doesn’t benefit us by any means,” says Tweedale. “We want to create something that lasts—that isn’t a scam like everything else in this industry. I want to create something that breaks the wheel and actually grows the market of crypto as a whole.”\nPart of that plan entails using Pump.Fun’s early success and established userbase to expand the platform into a general-purpose destination for social content, he claims.\n“We no longer describe them as memecoins internally. I see them more as content,” says Tweedale. “Instagram and TikTok are syphoning a lot of value away from creators. The thing we want to create is one step above that, where all the money flows directly towards the creators.”\nThe route to Pump.Fun achieving that end is unclear; Tweedale did not make himself available to discuss his plans in further detail. But investors see potential in the idea of using crypto as a way for people to invest in online creators they believe to be promising. (Though perils abound, as shown recently by the outcry over a memecoin launched by Haliey Welch of Hawk Tuah fame.)\n“I don’t know how they would do it, but I love the idea of a floating market for content creators,” says Hamilton, the venture capitalist and Sarcophagus founder.\n“When I talk to the young guys trading memecoins, it is such a social experience. It’s not a sit-alone-in-your-basement experience,” says Jiang. “It would make sense to marry some of that natural discourse already happening around memecoins with the platform being used to launch the coins.”\nThough counterintuitive, the way forward is for Pump.Fun to divorce itself from the culture of frenzied financial speculation on which its early success has been built, Tweedale proposes. “I have a problem with the way crypto is used in speculation,” says Tweedale. But if the profit motive behind memecoin trading can somehow be harnessed to realign social-media economics to better favor users and creators, he claims, “that’s when you create something truly great.”",

Maybe you’re looking to save up for an important purchase, pay off past debts, or just want to be more conscientious about your spending habits. Almost always, a budget is a critical place to begin. And you have plenty of options to get started with the process. You could try keeping an Excel spreadsheet with a log of monthly purchases. Or maybe take a more physical route, stuffing your cash into categorized envelopes.\nThough, if you’re looking for a way to track spending that’s more streamlined and on your smartphone, a budgeting app is worth a try. Keep in mind that usually when a financial app is offered for free, it’s monetized more aggressively by the company providing it. So, it might be worth getting a subscription to a paid tool for a couple of months to try out the user experience, and cancel if it’s not a fit.\nWhether you’re looking for a whole new way to approach your money mindset or are just trying to be a little more careful with those coins, these five apps focus on practical advice, assist with budgeting, and might help reduce your overall financial stress.\nJanuary 2025: This article was updated to reflect current details about the budgeting apps.\nYNAB\nBudgeting in your head is tough, especially if no one has shown you the ropes. YNAB (You Need a Budget) makes financial planning manageable. You'll be able to sync all of your accounts, track your monthly spending, stay on top of your bills, and set aside savings for emergency situations—all in one hub. The company offers online workshops that can give you the skills needed to break free of that pesky debt and increase your savings. After a free 34-day trial, YNAB costs $109 per year—but you can just factor that into your budget.\nCopilot\nThe breezy user experience provided by Copilot makes the finance app stand out. Once it’s connected to your bank account, transactions are automatically organized into emoji-labeled groups. The app can suggest new amounts for budget categories based on past spending and keep tabs on recurring payments. Acorns, Robinhood, and other apps connect with Copilot to help you keep an eye on any investments. For those who are overwhelmed by the thought of financial tracking, Copilot is an approachable entry point to the world of money management. Unfortunately, the app is available only for iOS users. After a monthlong free trial, the annual subscription costs $95.\nAcorns\nThe world of investments and returns can be obtuse to a newcomer. Skip the appointments with stockbrokers and consider downloading Acorns instead. It simplifies the investment process by rounding up every purchase you make to the nearest dollar and automatically investing the change into a diversified portfolio. The basic service costs $3 per month, and you can cash out your investments at any time.\nOportun\nIf you're not ready to fully plunge into the risky world of investments, Oportun (formerly called Digit) provides another way to build your savings. It's an automated process, just like Acorns, but instead of mainly focusing on investments, it's geared toward saving the money you already have. Every day Oportun withdraws money from your account to deposit into a savings account. The app monitors your spending habits and your income, so it will only withdraw what it thinks you won’t need. Long-term and retirement investments are also available through Oportun. You can try it out for free for 30 days, after which you'll have to pay $5 per month.\nCredit Karma\nIt’s not a budgeting app, but the free Credit Karma app, owned by Intuit, might help you decipher that credit score and how it's changing over time. Your credit score is very important: Lenders, landlords, and insurers may all want to check it. The number fluctuates and primarily tracks whether you make credit card or loan payments on time as well as how much of your allotted credit is used. The Credit Karma app collates reports from TransUnion and Equifax and then explains the factors affecting your score. While the app is good for score tracking, you’re likely better off ignoring the in-app advertisers pushing loans based on your data.",

    "content_text": "With the clock running out on the Biden administration, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has sued Elon Musk in federal court. The statute at hand is relatively straightforward. The timing of the complaint is more complicated.\nThe SEC’s complaint centers on Musk’s acquisition of Twitter stock in early 2022. According to the complaint, Musk failed to notify the agency that he had acquired more than 5 percent of common shares in the company within 10 calendar days. If true, that delay would violate federal security laws. “As a result, Musk was able to continue purchasing shares at artificially low prices,” the SEC alleges, “allowing him to underpay by at least $150 million for shares he purchased after his beneficial ownership report was due.” The SEC has asked for a jury trial.\nThis should all be pretty simple. “It looks like a straightforward case about a clear violation of a well-established SEC rule,” says James Park, a professor at UCLA School of Law who focuses on securities regulation and corporate law. You either file your paperwork within 10 days or you don’t; the SEC claims that Musk didn’t. He acquired enough shares to cross that threshold by March 14 of that year, the agency alleges, and didn’t publicly disclose his ownership until April 4. (The SEC alleges that Musk was technically 11 days late, as he continued to acquire shares through March 24.)\nAnd yet it took nearly three years for the SEC to bring a case. “The question is, why are they doing it now,” says David Rosenfeld, former cohead of the SEC’s New York enforcement office and currently a professor at Northern Illinois University College of Law. “The only plausible answer is they want to get it done before the administration changes.” Rosenfeld notes that he did not review the SEC complaint in depth.\nThat executive branch changeover, which happens in less than a week, creates a more favorable regulatory environment for Musk, who donated hundreds of millions of dollars to political action committees supporting Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and has reportedly been a close adviser to the president-elect during the transition period. Current SEC chair Gary Gensler will likely be replaced by Trump’s nominee, Paul Atkins, who is widely viewed as supporting a lighter regulatory touch.\nMusk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, says he believes the complaint is a parting shot. “As the SEC retreats and leaves office, the SEC’s multiyear campaign of harassment against Mr. Musk culminated in the filing of a single-count ticky-tack complaint against Mr. Musk,” he wrote in an email.\nWhile the filing comes just before Trump’s January 20 inauguration, the investigation that led to this complaint has been years in the making. The agency had to subpoena Musk in May of 2023 to get his testimony in the investigation and has said that Musk canceled on them two days before his scheduled testimony that September. A federal court upheld an earlier decision to compel him to testify in May of 2024; SEC lawyers flew out to interview him on September 10, but he stood them up once again to attend a SpaceX launch.\nWhich is to say that the reason this has taken so long is, at least in part, Musk’s ability to drag it out. And while the filing landing at the tail end of Biden’s term does “raise an eyebrow,” according to Adam Pritchard, coauthor of Securities Regulation: Cases and Analysis and a professor at the University of Michigan Law School, there’s not generally much of a lame duck period at the SEC.\n“It is not at all unusual for enforcement actions to be brought after an election with a change in administration on the horizon,” Pritchard says. “Many attorneys will be looking to leave, and they want to bring actions before they go.”\nAnd now that the SEC has gone down the road of litigation? Don’t expect Atkins to necessarily provide an off-ramp.\n“I would be surprised if the new administration completely dropped the case,” says Park. “It’s possible that the new administration could settle the case for a nominal sum, but that would be problematic because it would show favoritism and send that important SEC rules can be deliberately violated without sanction.”\nBailing on the case is especially unlikely, Pritchard says, precisely because it’s so straightforward. “It is hardly a situation where you would think the Enforcement Division was overreaching,” he says.\nUnder normal circumstances, says Rosenfeld, the vast majority of SEC cases are settled. But given that Musk seems disinclined to do so thus far, the first high-profile case of the SEC under a second Trump term may well turn out to be against his most important benefactor.",

    "content_text": "Extremists including white supremacists and border livestreamers have descended on Los Angeles in the midst of the wildfires there to gain followers, juice social media engagement, solicit donations and, experts claim, recruit new members, while in some cases LARPing as emergency workers.\nThis past weekend Ryan Sánchez and three other members of his Nationalist Network group set up shop at the entrance to Santa Monica Pier. Sánchez, who was caught on video giving a Nazi salute during last year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, and his crew had driven overnight from Arizona, where they live.\nSánchez, who was a member of the now-defunct white supremacist fight club known as the Rise Above Movement, is an ally of white supremacist Nick Fuentes and is sometimes known by his online moniker “Culture War Criminal.”\nSánchez, who did not respond to WIRED’s requests for comment, claims on his social media accounts that his group “got much more support than anticipated” and said that all of the donations were given to the Bob Hope Patriotic Hall, a building said to be sheltering veterans as well as charities involved with military and veterans affairs. (It did not respond to a request to confirm that Sánchez’s group made donations.)\nWhile Sánchez and his colleagues claim they are in LA to do good, experts who track the activities of far-right groups tell WIRED that what they are really engaging in is “disaster tourism” to further their own agenda by appearing to do good for society.\n“Based on a lot of their past activities, this is probably being used as a recruitment effort, which is something that's been happening a lot more over the last year where far-right groups engage in disaster tourism,” says Freddy Cruz, the program manager for monitoring and training at Western States Center. “We saw it with Hurricane Helene, and now we're seeing it again. These groups are essentially just traveling to disaster zones to create propaganda, solicit donations, and in some cases actually stealing donations from people on the ground.”\nOn Monday, Sánchez said that while his group was no longer collecting goods for the relief effort, it was still interested in meeting potential new recruits.\n“We will not be accepting any more donations tomorrow, but if you are still interested in volunteering, contact us,” Sánchez wrote on Telegram and X on Sunday morning.\nA donation link Sánchez posted to his Telegram channel links directly to his personal Cash App account, and it’s unclear where any money being donated was going, though Sánchez suggested it was being used to fund his group’s travel and accommodation.\n“The crisis in Los Angeles continues, with high winds expected in the coming days. Thanks to your support, the Nationalist Network will be here for our fellow Americans,” Sánchez wrote on his Telegram and X accounts on Monday, before asking for further donations “if you would like to help keep our activists fed and in the fight.”\nAs well as Sánchez and the Nationalist Network, multiple MAGA livestreamers traveled to LA in recent days to begin posting content from the aftermath of the fires while at the same time soliciting money from their followers.\nOne pair of livestreamers, who in the past have been featured on Alex Jones’ Infowars platforms, produced a 17-minute “documentary” on the wildfires filled with disinformation about the source of the fires and the actions of the LA fire department.\nIn some cases, livestreamers moved from documenting the aftermath of the fires to LARPing as firefighters.\nA livestreamer who is known online as Anthony Aguero, who typically livestreams from the US-Mexico border while pushing anti-immigrant disinformation, posted a video of himself tackling a fire he says he came across while driving in LA on Monday.\n“I jumped on to action and became a firefighter for a few minutes,” Aguero wrote on X. “I don’t understand how not 1 person tried to stop this fire, it took a guy from Texas to stop it.”\nThe video shows Aguero carrying a bucket filled with water toward the flames; as he leaves, there are clearly still flames visible behind him. Aguero, who calls himself an “independent reporter bringing you raw truth,” also posted a video in which he was talking to Los Angeles Police Department officers on Sunday, claiming in accompanying text that 20 to 30 officers were involved in questioning him and a number of other people who were with him at the time after they were “SWATTED BY LEFTISTS.”\nIn another video posted on YouTube, Aguero is seen chasing police cars through the streets of LA trying to see what incident they were responding to.\nAguero didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nAguero is one of numerous so-called citizen journalists who have filmed themselves in dangerous situations in recent days. Some appear in the midst of firefighters trying to tackle a blaze, at times traveling toward approaching fires rather than away from them. Other videos show them engaging in vigilantism, chasing people they allege to be looters while continuing to livestream to their followers.\nThese videos are typically posted on X and YouTube, where livestreamers solicit donations or post links to their merchandise sites. Almost all of the streamers have blue checkmarks on X, which means their accounts are able to monetize the content they post.",

    "content_text": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nA virtual private network (VPN) is like a protective tunnel you can use to pass through a public network, protecting your data from outside eyes. Whether you're worried about hiding your online activity from your internet service provider so it doesn't sell your data to advertisers, or you want to stay safe on a public Wi-Fi hot spot to keep nearby digital snoops from capturing your passwords, a VPN can help protect you.\nHowever, while a VPN will keep you safe at your local coffee shop, it comes with a cost. Using a VPN means your VPN provider will know everything about your browsing habits. This makes VPN providers a target for hackers. Be sure you even need one before you read on.\nPicking the right VPN service is serious business. Your online privacy is at stake. Most VPN providers say they keep no logs of their users' activity, but how do you know for sure? You're stuck taking companies at their word. For this reason, we've limited our testing to VPN providers independently audited by security firms and have published the results. We've tested dozens of VPNs; these are the best we've tried.\nUpdated January 2025: We've added NordVPN back to our list of recommendations, changed our top pick to ProtonVPN, and added a section for VPNs on iOS.\n- The Best VPN: ProtonVPN\n- Another Great VPN: Mullvad\n- Best for Circumventing Geographic Restrictions: Surfshark VPN\n- Best VPN Service for Beginners: TunnelBear\n- The Fastest VPN: NordVPN\n- Best for High-Risk Use Cases: Tor\n- Other VPNs We've Tried\n- The Best Free VPN\n- The Best VPN for iPhones\n- How We Test\n- Limitations of VPNs\nSpecial offer for Gear readers: Get WIRED for just $5 ($25 off). This includes unlimited access to WIRED.com, full Gear coverage, and subscriber-only newsletters. Subscriptions help fund the work we do every day.\nThe Best VPN\nProton VPN is part of a suite of privacy tools from Proton, which is best known for its encrypted email service, ProtonMail. The company is based in Switzerland, which has no data retention laws, so Proton VPN can have a no-logs policy. It has been independently audited and maintains a warrant canary page. All the usual features of a good VPN are here, including support for multi-hop connections, a kill switch in the app, split tunneling support, pretty good geo evasion for making Netflix work, and support for torrents. There's also support for some nice add-ons like ad blocking, malware protection, custom DNS, Tor over VPN (connecting to .onion sites), and high-speed streaming.\nProton VPN also offers the best free VPN. Unlike most services, ProtonVPN's free version gives full access to all the regular plan's features. It is limited to a single device, and there are only three server locations (Japan, Netherlands, and the US), but everything else is the same. If your needs are limited and you want to keep costs down, this is a good option.\nProton's pricing structure can be confusing, since you can combine it with other services to lower the rates. For purposes of testing, I used a one-year Proton VPN Plus plan that's $6 per month. If you use other Proton services, Proton Unlimited pricing is a better deal ($10 per month gets you access to all five Proton services).\nProton's VPN app is open source and available for nearly all operating systems, including macOS, Linux, Windows, Android, and iOS. With the Plus plan, 10 devices can connect simultaneously. Proton VPN uses a mix of IKEv2, OpenVPN, and WireGuard for connections. By default, the app chooses for you, but you can make a selection in the settings. I also like the Permanent Kill Switch, which prevents your device from reconnecting to the internet without a VPN even after a reboot.\nIn my testing over the past year, speeds on Proton VPN vary considerably by server and time of day. Overall, Proton VPN is very fast, dropping my speed by only around 7 to 8 percent versus unprotected speed. I also did not detect any DNS leaks through any of the servers I tried. Perhaps most importantly, I haven't been blocked by Reddit, Meta, or any other larger internet services, which are increasingly blocking VPN traffic.\nProton VPN has a free plan, but it's limited to one device. It otherwise costs $5 per month if you buy a two-year or one-year plan, and $10 per month if you pay monthly.\nAnother Great VPN\nFormerly our top pick, Mullvad has a refreshingly down-to-earth approach that doesn't overhype with its marketing and helps users take additional steps to protect their privacy. For example, the company has an entire page showing how to disable WebRTC in your web browser. As long as WebRTC is enabled (and it is by default in most browsers), websites can view your actual IP address even when you use a VPN. Nothing about Mullvad's actually VPN service caused me to move it out of the top spot. It remains the best VPN is privacy is your top concern.\nPrivacy gets such a high priority at Mullvad, you can even pay for it in cash. If you prefer to remain totally anonymous, you can generate a random account number, write that number down on a slip of paper, and mail it, along with cash, to Sweden. In theory, no one will be able to connect you to that account. (The truly paranoid will don a tinfoil hat, wear gloves, print from a public printer, and mail from a remote mailbox.) I have not tested the cash option, but I did recently extend my Mullvad subscription using Bitcoin, and it worked without a hitch.\nMullvad offers apps for every major platform, as well as routers. The applications are all open source, and you can check the code on GitHub. The service has been independently audited as well. Advanced users can download configuration files and use them directly with OpenVPN or Wireguard.\nIn my testing, speeds were very good. Mullvad has a smaller number of servers than speedier services like NordVPN, but I never encountered a situation where I couldn't get a fast enough connection. In my speed tests Mullvad sits squarely in the middle of the pack. Over the years Mullvad remains the VPN I rely on day-to-day. The problem, and the reason it is no longer our top pick, is that too many sites block its servers. Reddit, sometimes YouTube, Facebook and Instagram all frequently block me when I use Mullvad, as does ChatGPT. Personally, I am fine finding workarounds for this, but for most users it adds a layer of hassle that's not there with ProtonVPN, which is why Mullvad has been moved to the number 2 spot.\nMullvad VPN costs 5 euros (around $5) per month, cash or charge.\nBest for Circumventing Geographic Restrictions\nSurfshark wouldn't be my top pick if my life depended on my VPN, but for most of us, that's not the case. If you want a way to get around some geographical restrictions on content (aka access Netflix) and protect your traffic while using an open Wi-Fi hotspot, Surfshark is a good choice. It's secure, and it provides great value for the money if you pay for two years upfront.\nIn my testing over the years, Surfshark has consistently had some of the best speeds of any VPN I've used. Yes, it is slower than not using a VPN, but I have never had any problem streaming HD and 4K content through Surfshark. It's fast enough that you won't notice much speed degradation.\nSurfshark offers all the privacy features you need in a VPN, like a kill switch that automatically stops your traffic if your VPN connection fails, and support for multi-hop VPN connections, which means your traffic goes from your machine to a VPN server to another VPN server, and then to the destination server. Multi-hop provides an extra layer of protection should the VPN itself be compromised, though there is a corresponding speed hit when using a multi-hop connection. The company also recently added support for manual Wireguard configuration. Most people will be fine sticking with Surfshark's apps, but if you're trying to connect your entire network to Surfshark directly through a router, the manual configuration will be welcome news.\nI have not had a chance to test it much yet, but Surfshark recently added support for dedicated IP addresses. Given that shared IPs are how some websites block VPNs, a dedicated IP could be handy for those hoping to unblock streaming services. Surfshark has six dedicated IP locations, but the number of IPs is limited. A dedicated IP will set you back another $3.75 per month and only works with Surfshark's apps.\nSurfshark is based in the British Virgin Islands, which, although technically a territory of Great Britain, is generally considered a safe haven and has no data-retention laws. What I don't like is that Surfshark is legally untested. The company has a zero-log policy, and you can (and should) opt out of the diagnostic crash reports in the app. The company's browser extensions have undergone an independent security audit that didn't turn up any significant problems, and in January 2023, the auditing firm Deloitte verified Surfshark's no-logs statement. in 2022 Surfshark merged with NordVPN, but it operates independently.\nSurfshark costs $3 per month if you buy two years up front, and $3 per month if you buy one year up front.\nBest VPN Service for Beginners\nChoosing a VPN can be overwhelming. If you're tired of security mumbo jumbo and lock icons, TunnelBear might be the VPN for you. Its cute bear animations help demystify what VPNs do, how they work, and what they can offer you. Sometimes the easiest way to make technology more approachable is to put a friendly face on it.\nDon't worry though, TunnelBear isn't all cute bear animations. It has the same security features as other VPN providers, like a no-logging policy and a clear privacy policy, and it's been independently audited. The TunnelBear apps are a little more barebones that some, but the basic VPN features are there, like a kill switch to shut off internet access if the VPN goes down, options for all the common VPN protocols, and AES 256-bit encryption.\nIn my testing, speeds with TunnelBear were competitive with the other options listed here. One of my favorite parts of TunnelBear is the free trial option, which makes it easy to test-drive it and see what your speeds are like without committing. TunnelBear has fewer geographic server locations than some of our other options, but unless you're traveling abroad or need to get around a specific geo-restriction, that shouldn't matter for most users.\nTunnelBear costs $3.33 per month if you buy one year upfront.\nThe Fastest VPN\nNordVPN has been in our guide for years, though after some bad customer-service incidents we pulled it out to retest. After testing NordVPN over the past six months, and repeatedly asking customer service to solve problems, which they did, I am adding it back to our list of recommendations.\nIn 2020 Nord Security merged with Surfshark VPN (recommended above). Both VPNs continue to operate independently, but there is considerable overlap in the services offered. Nord's parent company is based in Panama, which is outside the 14-Eyes Alliance, meaning there's nothing forcing NordVPN to gather user data.\nNordVPN has much to recommend about it, perhaps the highlight being speed, especially when it comes to upload speeds, which makes it a popular choice for sharing torrents. I like the built-in ad and tracking blocker in the mobile app, and NordVPN is great for unblocking entertainment sites like Netflix, Hulu, and Max. The NordVPN apps offer a kill switch that automatically stops your traffic if your VPN connection fails, and it supports multi-hop VPN connections. NordVPN supports a good variety of protocols, including OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec for mobile, and what the company calls NordLynx, which is based on WireGuard.\nNordVPN's track record for privacy is pretty good too. In October 2024, in connection with a criminal investigation, NordVPN received a binding warrant from the Panamanian government to provide user data. The company says “the only information we were able to provide was payment-related data and confirmation about the existence of the account tied to the email address provided to us by the authorities.”\nBest for High-Risk Use Cases\nIf you're in a situation where personal security is of the utmost importance, do not rely on a VPN. Use Tor (ideally through Tails) instead. Using the Tor network accomplishes some of the same things as a VPN, but it's different. Tor provides anonymity, meaning no one can figure out who you are, but not necessarily privacy. People still might be able to see what you're doing, they won't know it's you doing it. (VPNs provide privacy because no one can see what you're doing while you're going out of a VPN tunnel, but you don't have anonymity because the VPN provider knows who you are.)\nTor is simple to set up. All you need to do is download the Tor browser and it will connect you to the web. Once connected to the Tor network, you can browse the web normally. Except everything will be slower. When using Tor, your request for a website hops around the Tor network, bouncing between servers, before emerging and connecting to the site you want to visit. This makes Tor slow, sometimes incredibly slow, but that's necessary to protect your anonymity. And yes, you can combine a VPN with Tor, though that's somewhat beyond the scope of this guide.\nOther VPNs We’ve Tried\n- ExpressVPN: We also used to recommend ExpressVPN, but we no longer do because it has a new parent company and we haven't been able to verify anything about it.\n- Google One VPN: Google One VPN was part of Google One but is slated to be shut down. We never recommended it—let us not forget that Google has repeatedly been caught collecting data that it said it wasn't collecting, which is not what you want to hear from a VPN provider. Nor do we recommend the VPN that comes with Google Fi or the one available in Pixel phones. If you aren't paying for your VPN, two things will happen: It will either shut down, or you will be the thing being sold. Most of the VPNs we recommend are about $5 per month; real privacy is worth $5 a month.\nThere are a lot of VPNs out there, but most are not worth your money. If all you want to do is circumvent some Netflix geographic restrictions, then just about any of them will work (we still suggest sticking with our recommended options, but if you can't be stopped, then carry on). For anything more serious, like actually protecting your privacy and data, learn to use Tor. Yes, it's a little technical, but trust me, it's worth learning how to do if your life, family, and job are at stake.\nThe Best Free VPN\nAs noted above, ProtonVPN has a free version. It's limited to a single device and there are only three servers to connect to which means it can be slow. There are no logs, no ads, and no other limits. In my testing, it was slower than the paid account, but it does work. Several other VPNs offer 30-day money-back guarantees, here's the details on NordVPN's refund policy.\nOther than that, it's worth keeping in mind the adage, “If you're not paying for it, you are the product.” Do not trust a VPN that isn't taking your money (and don't trust many that are either). The good news is that all the picks above offer free trials, which allow you to evaluate how well each VPN will work in your unique situation and for your needs.\nAnd remember that there is a way to browse more securely without spending a dime: use the Tor network. Do I sound like a broken record yet? Good. If you're short on cash, use Tor.\nThe Best VPN for iPhones\nApple likes to tout how secure its phones are, and you’ll find many Apple fans suggesting you don’t need to use a VPN with your iPhone. It’s true that Apple’s iOS does have a better privacy and security track record than Android, but that doesn’t have anything to do with a VPN. A VPN can protect you even after data leaves your phone, by hiding your IP address for instance, making it possible to circumvent geofences or access services from outside your home country. All that said, a VPN does affect connection speeds and can cause problems with other functionality, especially on iOS devices.\nOur top pick, ProtonVPN, is also our top pick for iPhones. The app is simple to use, disabling the VPN in event of issues is simple, as is reconnecting, and in our testing it caused the fewest problems with iCloud (iCloud Private Relay, which is not a VPN, but does obscure our IP and data from ISPs). If you’re worried about the bandwidth overhead or you notice internet traffic slowing considerably, it might be worth trying NordVPN for iOS. Just remember to only run one VPN at a time.\nHow We Test VPNs\nVPN providers like to claim they keep no logs, which means they know nothing about what you do using their services. There are a variety of reasons to be skeptical about this claim, namely because they have to have a user ID of some kind tied to a payment method, which means the potential exists to link your credit card number (and thus your identity) to your browsing activity.\nFor that reason, I mainly limited my testing to providers subpoenaed for user data in the US or Europe that failed to produce the logs or have at least undergone a third-party security audit. While these criteria can't guarantee the providers aren't saving log data, this method gives us a starting point for filtering through the hundreds of VPN providers. Unfortunately, other factors also come into play. VPNs that once made our list—like ExpressVPN—are sometimes sold to less reputable companies.\nUsing these criteria, I narrowed the field to the most popular, reputable VPN providers and began testing them over several networks (4G, 5G, cable, FiOS, and plenty of painfully slow coffee shop networks) over the years. To compare speeds consistently, before each update I run through each of our picks again, one after the other testing over a Starlink connection via a laptop, and a 4G Verizon connection on mobile. I also considered available payment methods, how often connections dropped, and any slowdowns I encountered. Lastly, I've tested DNS leaks using both BrowserLeaks and IPLeak.\nAll that gives me a baseline on which to evaluate the speed and security, but the results are still unique to that moment. These tests are a snapshot in time and can be affected by all sorts of variables ranging from your web browser to your ISP. As noted above, while we believe the recommended VPNs above are secure, fast, and of good value, in situations where sensitive data is involved, please use Tor.\nWhat Are the Limitations of VPNs and Do You Even Need One?\nIt's important to understand not just what a VPN can do, but also what it can't do. As noted above, VPNs act like a protective tunnel. A VPN shields you from people trying to snoop on your traffic while it's in transit between your computer and the website you're browsing or the service you're using.\nPublic networks that anyone can join—even if they have to use a password to connect—are easy hunting grounds for attackers who want to see your network data. If your data is being sent unencrypted—like if the website you're connecting to doesn't use the secure HTTPS method—the amount of information an attacker can gather from you can be disastrous. Web browsers used to show a green lock icon at the top of your screen next to the web address, but that's going away. Instead, browsers will warn you when a page isn't secure. These days, most websites connect using HTTPS, so you're probably fine most of the time, but on school, library, and small business websites, this may not always be the case. Unless you're using a VPN, which hides your activity, even on unencrypted websites. Just connecting to a VPN isn't enough. Be sure to check out our guide to using a VPN to make sure you have everything set up correctly.\nA VPN also changes your IP address, which adds a layer of protection. By giving you a different IP address, a VPN can make it appear as though you're in a different physical location. So even if you're sitting in California, the website you're accessing will think you're in Canada, Hungary, Uruguay, or Thailand. Unfortunately, this method of obscuring your location is not airtight. Technology built into web browsers known as WebRTC can leak your true IP address even when you're using a VPN. If this is a concern, disable WebRTC in your browser before connecting to a VPN. Mullvad has instructions on how to disable WebRTC in most browsers.\nIt's debatable how much masking your IP address helps protect your privacy in the first place. Your IP address is only one of many, many bits of data websites collect about you. If privacy is your concern, you're better off using web browsers (and extensions) that offer additional tools to protect your privacy. Mozilla Firefox has several of these tools available. Or if you want to get serious about it, use the ultra-private Tor browser as noted above.\nTo add to the confusion around VPNs, providers—even some I've recommended here, unfortunately—often engage in misleading marketing. Nearly every VPN service website I visited had some kind of red banner claiming I was “not protected,” even when I was using a VPN at the time. The problem is that I wasn't using their VPN. More honest VPN providers, like Mullvad, tell you what's happening: “You're not protected by Mullvad.” Kudos to Mullvad for not using fear to sell subscriptions.\nEither way, the important thing to remember is that using a VPN does not make you anonymous. While VPNs may not be able to do much to protect your privacy, they are an essential tool when it comes to protecting you from snoops trying to gather your unencrypted data sent over insecure networks.",

years, though after some bad customer-service incidents we pulled it out to retest. After testing NordVPN over the past six months, and repeatedly asking customer service to solve problems, which they did, I am adding it back to our list of recommendations.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In 2020 Nord Security merged with Surfshark VPN (recommended above). Both VPNs continue to operate independently, but there is considerable overlap in the services offered. Nord's parent company is based in Panama, which is outside the 14-Eyes Alliance, meaning there's nothing forcing NordVPN to gather user data.</p><p class=\"paywall\">NordVPN has much to recommend about it, perhaps the highlight being speed, especially when it comes to upload speeds, which makes it a popular choice for sharing torrents. I like the built-in ad and tracking blocker in the mobile app, and NordVPN is great for unblocking entertainment sites like Netflix, Hulu, and Max. The NordVPN apps offer a kill switch that automatically stops your traffic if your VPN connection fails, and it supports multi-hop VPN connections. NordVPN supports a good variety of protocols, including OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec for mobile, and what the company calls NordLynx, which is based on WireGuard.</p><p class=\"paywall\">NordVPN's track record for privacy is pretty good too. In October 2024, in connection with a criminal investigation, NordVPN received a binding warrant from the Panamanian government to provide user data. The company says “the only information we were able to provide was payment-related data and confirmation about the existence of the account tied to the email address provided to us by the authorities.”</p><p id=\"risk\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Best for High-Risk Use Cases</h2></p><p class=\"paywall\">If you're in a situation where personal security is of the utmost importance, do not rely on a VPN. Use Tor (ideally through <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://tails.boum.org/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://tails.boum.org/\" href=\"https://tails.boum.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tails</a>) instead. Using the Tor network accomplishes some of the same things as a VPN, but it's different. Tor provides anonymity, meaning no one can figure out who you are, but not necessarily privacy. People still might be able to see what you're doing, they won't know it's you doing it. (VPNs provide privacy because no one can see what you're doing while you're going out of a VPN tunnel, but you don't have anonymity because the VPN provider knows who you are.)</p><p class=\"paywall\">Tor is simple to set up. All you need to do is <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://torproject.org//download/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://torproject.org//download/\" href=\"https://torproject.org//download/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">download the Tor browser</a> and it will connect you to the web. Once connected to the Tor network, you can browse the web normally. Except everything will be slower. When using Tor, your request for a website hops around the Tor network, bouncing between servers, before emerging and connecting to the site you want to visit. This makes Tor slow, sometimes incredibly slow, but that's necessary to protect your anonymity. And yes, you can combine a VPN with Tor, though that's somewhat beyond the scope of this guide.</p><hr class=\"paywall\"/><p id=\"other\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Other VPNs We’ve Tried</h2></p><ul class=\"paywall\"><li><strong><a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/CjNb2fje8XMy8fitSuVQNVx8eqGfdur3vFZsPVgTem8tevRLwrSTxhnB9HUQZvncKjfZGTDkikfcdEcnZqAiTbe49jhncmxKpUgJi7VmDfrqCqWCu1t7WbpWCpTLAWRusTEQ9FTrRWrEVCM12T9TmFf37avykxmE2bJFMB3gH8j4VkiDnhsJoMmBE5UNYq5QQsjX1oa5D95jvFhQHECFMJyGmQxNnDvj7YX1qZoWMTaioBQDrNwaduKYsZbCoW\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.expressvpn.com/\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/CjNb2fje8XMy8fitSuVQNVx8eqGfdur3vFZsPVgTem8tevRLwrSTxhnB9HUQZvncKjfZGTDkikfcdEcnZqAiTbe49jhncmxKpUgJi7VmDfrqCqWCu1t7WbpWCpTLAWRusTEQ9FTrRWrEVCM12T9TmFf37avykxmE2bJFMB3gH8j4VkiDnhsJoMmBE5UNYq5QQsjX1oa5D95jvFhQHECFMJyGmQxNnDvj7YX1qZoWMTaioBQDrNwaduKYsZbCoW\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ExpressVPN</a>:</strong> We also used to recommend ExpressVPN, but we no longer do because it has a new parent company and we haven't been able to verify anything about it.</li><li><strong>Google One VPN:</strong> Google One VPN was part of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-google-one/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google One</a> but is slated to be shut down.

Nor do we recommend the VPN that comes with Google Fi or the one available in Pixel phones. If you aren't paying for your VPN, two things will happen: It will either shut down, or you will be the thing being sold. Most of the VPNs we recommend are about $5 per month; real privacy is worth $5 a month.</li></ul><p class=\"paywall\">There are a lot of VPNs out there, but most are not worth your money. If all you want to do is circumvent some Netflix geographic restrictions, then just about any of them will work (we still suggest sticking with our recommended options, but if you can't be stopped, then carry on). For anything more serious, like actually protecting your privacy and data, learn to use Tor. Yes, it's a little technical, but trust me, it's worth learning how to do if your life, family, and job are at stake.</p><hr class=\"paywall\"/><p id=\"free\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">The Best Free VPN</h2></p><p class=\"paywall\">As noted above, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/4wXieV9Z5T21RAWtQS9rkNFZ8HYptfU2zUH8NRnDoWrHgpF9bvJRiWPeKVhL63jq8be6wW6MzcYmrmKyVjVktvRiYkAE9AomXL7XC1BqX2xQT6JQCQ2md41CimqCiLnHiK6B9Xk8xCAUviyzFVqwm9YJurNczXNxJM5gW5d6ib1SChVLaXWUdr5NbqRYngsgcwyTWBcPXZRLvsC7jLRUByUZ9mwjAfHnW5UApdgcHVZqtdBVQ9Ni1dxhNS4jaFrWp\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://protonvpn.com/pricing\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/4wXieV9Z5T21RAWtQS9rkNFZ8HYptfU2zUH8NRnDoWrHgpF9bvJRiWPeKVhL63jq8be6wW6MzcYmrmKyVjVktvRiYkAE9AomXL7XC1BqX2xQT6JQCQ2md41CimqCiLnHiK6B9Xk8xCAUviyzFVqwm9YJurNczXNxJM5gW5d6ib1SChVLaXWUdr5NbqRYngsgcwyTWBcPXZRLvsC7jLRUByUZ9mwjAfHnW5UApdgcHVZqtdBVQ9Ni1dxhNS4jaFrWp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ProtonVPN</a> has a free version.

    "content_text": "The sun beat down on Zelu as she waited on the curb in front of the house for the robot to arrive.\nIt was mid-July, and it was 95 degrees Fahrenheit and what felt like 100 percent humidity. As uncomfortable as she was, Zelu was used to it. She was a Chicagoan, which meant she was used to every weather extreme except hurricanes. The problem was that sometimes she just wasn’t prepared for it. What had she been thinking when she’d put on jeans instead of shorts on a day like this? She was sure her legs were slowly roasting under the thick, dark fabric. She was wearing a blue tank top, and even her exposed arms were frying.\n“Why don’t you wait inside?” her mother asked, coming out. “Whoo! So hot! It’s not healthy.”\n“I’m fine, Mom,” Zelu said. “I don’t know how long it’ll wait for me if I’m not already here.” She looked at the app just as it notified her. “It’s arriving.”\nThey both looked up the street now. Zelu couldn’t keep the grin off her face. This was so fucking cool. A sleek white SUV was coming toward them. No one was in the driver’s seat.\n“You sure about this?” her mother asked.\n“Yeah, Mom,” she said. “It’s research for my novel … sort of.”\n“You should just stay home. Watch a movie. Read a book.”\n“I don’t want to stay home,” Zelu snapped.\n“Then wait a few weeks. Let them work out all the bugs. Blood of Jesus, they just put these things on the road today.” She grasped the handles of Zelu’s chair.\n“Mom, don’t,” Zelu said, putting her hands on her wheels. “It’s not going to run us over.”\n“You sure?”\nNo, Zelu thought. “Positive,” she said aloud as she watched the SUV stop in front of them. There was a glass bubble on top for the rotating cameras, sensors on the sides, and absolutely no one in the vehicle. Her mother groaned nervously as the side door slid open and a platform descended. “Ah, my daughter, I don’t know if this is bravery or foolishness, ooooo.”\n“Don’t worry, Mom.” Zelu laughed, wheeling onto the platform. It lifted her up and then she easily wheeled right into the vehicle. She secured her chair with the harnesses, which were easy to reach and connect.\nThe autonomous vehicle service was funded by the city of Chicago. Today was its first day of service, and all rides were free. The program had been tested first in the Southwest, in states like Arizona, California, and New Mexico. It had been so successful that it was expanded nationwide, Chicago being one of the last cities to get the service. According to her mother, though, this was the beginning of the end for humanity.\nZelu giggled to herself at the thought. It felt like she was living in the early days of her novel’s world, just before humankind perished and left the robots alone.\nThe inside smelled like piney air freshener. She took a quick glance around. It was clean, the seats beside her gray and plush. The driver’s and passenger’s seats were still there, as was the steering wheel. This was just a regular SUV turned into a self-driving car. A sort of evolution. Interesting. Her mom tapped on the window, and Zelu was shocked when it opened in response. She and her mom looked at each other for a moment and then they both laughed. “Wow,” her mother said, a surprised look on her face. “I know,” Zelu agreed.\n“You’ll be all right?”\n“I’m just going to the lake,” Zelu said. “I’ll be fine.”\n“Call me if you need me. I can come get you.”\n“Please prepare for your trip,” an automated voice announced. Her mother jumped back, as if the SUV would suddenly run her over.\n“Relax, Mom,” Zelu said. “Its sensors know you’re there. It won’t move until you’re at a safe distance.”\n“I’ll believe it when I see it,” her mother said.\n“You’re about to.”\nHer mother waved as the vehicle slowly drove off. Zelu waved back.\nAnd then she was all alone, and her life was in the hands of the SUV.\n“This is so weird,” she muttered as she watched the steering wheel moving on its own. It was the first time she’d ever been in a moving vehicle by herself. Nobody was there, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that there was a presence; something was in control. It was like being driven by a ghost. “Or should I say a NoBody,” she said to herself, laughing.\nWhen the vehicle stopped to turn onto the main road, her mirth vanished.\nShe believed in the science behind self-driving vehicles. The technology had existed for years now, and she’d been researching this new cab service over the last several months. The idea of being able to order one with her phone like an Uber and not have to deal with a human being who looked at her strangely, asked awkward questions, could be a serial killer, and so on, was a wonderful thought. More important, it would free her from her family. Whenever she asked one of them for a ride, they responded with this weird blend of pity, control, and duty. She didn’t think they even knew they did this. It always left her feeling pathetic and childlike, even when it was one of her younger siblings driving her. Oh, to be free of that feeling.\nNevertheless, in this moment, she wanted to shriek with panic. She dug her nails into the armrests of her chair. Despite all the research and reassurances from the customer service people she’d spoken with, this was very different now that it was happening in real time. What if there was a glitch and it miscalculated? What if another driver did some crazy thing the SUV couldn’t understand or adjust to? What if there was a solar flare and the whole car died?\n“Shit!” she screeched as the SUV made the turn. “I’m gonna die!”\nThen they were on the road. Zelu whooped and laughed with relief, still sweating bullets. The vehicle went at exactly the speed limit, which meant that everyone else passed her by. Several people did a double take, a few pointed, and two held up phones to record videos. Zelu was too stressed to pay any of it much mind. They were approaching the highway.\nAs they crossed an intersection, a plastic bag blew into the road. The SUV screeched to a stop. Zelu lurched forward in her chair and grabbed her handrests. She grunted, squeezing her eyes shut to prepare for the impact of another vehicle. There was honking and a car on her left swerved, but no crash came. Then they were on their way again, and Zelu prayed there would be no more trash blown into the field of the SUV’s sensors. There was no way she was going to relax at any moment of this trip.\nShe considered calling one of her siblings, then decided against it. If they saw her fear now, that would be all they saw from this point on. Maybe she could call Msizi? But he was in Durban, and if she told him she was scared of sitting in the self-driving SUV she’d chosen to be inside, that would only earn her an eye roll and “First-world problems” comment from him. If she called her mom, stress, stress, stress. So she waited it out as the car got on the highway.\nThe biggest hurdle was the most obvious one: Submitting to the technology. Trusting it. Granted, one did this every time one got behind the wheel of a car, or flew in an airplane, or boarded a train. Humans submitted to technology all the time. But this was different. She was alone; no human being was there to course-correct if something went wrong.\nBy the time she arrived at Navy Pier, she was shaking. But alive. “Arrived,” the SUV announced in its weirdly androgynous voice.\n“Yep,” Zelu said. It opened the door and then lowered the platform to the ground. People slowed to watch, which was super annoying. She rolled down the platform and she was officially on nonautomated ground again. She let out a sigh of relief. The vehicle raised the platform back up. She watched as it folded it back in and then closed the door. As it drove off, it honked twice, and on instinct, she raised a hand and waved.\n“What the hell am I doing?” she muttered, lowering her hand. A man who’d stopped to observe chuckled and then went on his way.\nShe watched the SUV leave, her heart rate slowing, a sense of normalcy returning to her. And then that relief became euphoria. She could call this cab anytime she needed. She could move herself around without any human’s aid. This SUV would help her—no, it could be like an extension of her. She could be like a robot with built-in wheels ready to carry her whenever she wanted.\nShe turned and wheeled up the boardwalk. She smiled to herself, feeling a warmth that emanated from within. “Yeah,” she said. “Just like a robot.”\nExcerpted from Death of the Author, by Nnedi Okorafor.

It was clean, the seats beside her gray and plush. The driver’s and passenger’s seats were still there, as was the steering wheel. This was just a regular SUV turned into a self-driving car. A sort of evolution. Interesting. Her mom tapped on the window, and Zelu was shocked when it opened in response. She and her mom looked at each other for a moment and then they both laughed. “Wow,” her mother said, a surprised look on her face. “I know,” Zelu agreed.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“You’ll be all right?”</p><p class=\"paywall\">“I’m just going to the lake,” Zelu said. “I’ll be fine.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">“Call me if you need me.

It was the first time she’d ever been in a moving vehicle by herself. Nobody was there, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that there was a presence; <em>something</em> was in control. It was like being driven by a ghost. “Or should I say a NoBody,” she said to herself, laughing.</p><p class=\"paywall\">When the vehicle stopped to turn onto the main road, her mirth vanished.</p><p class=\"paywall\">She believed in the science behind self-driving vehicles.

Learn more.\nThe old adage is true: The only things you can't escape in life are death and taxes. In the US, state requirements vary by a multitude of factors, and the federal government's tax code is arcane. The process can be as confusing as it is inescapable.\nI’ve researched and compiled all the information you need to prepare for the upcoming tax season. I've found answers to the most common tax-related questions, collected advice on filing for a small business or LLC, and identified ways to get more money on your return. I've also written a guide for The Best Tax Services, if you want to see how some of the most popular tax services stack up. Here’s our guide on how to pay taxes online to get a maximum benefit and minimum headache this year.\nWhen Are Taxes Due for 2024?\nLet’s start with the basics. Generally, your return is due on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the close of the fiscal year. This is typically April 15. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, it’s moved to the next business day. But taxes for most Americans are normally due April 15, and this year is no different. Your 2024 taxes must be filed by April 15, 2025.\nAs a proud April Aries, tax day falls on the week of my birthday nearly every year. (I’m actually paying Uncle Sam on my birthday? Rude.)\nWhen Can I Start Filing Taxes?\nTax season technically starts when the IRS begins accepting returns in late January. Employers are required to give their employees W-2 forms by the end of January, so this is when the majority of Americans will receive the necessary paperwork to begin filing. This year, January 29 is the official start date of the 2024 tax season. Although it’s largely dependent on when you actually get the necessary paperwork, early filing is recommended to avoid potential issues and stress. Filing early also reduces your chance of falling prey to identity theft, where somebody poses as you to collect your tax return. As a general rule for most things, it’s better to get an early start than get left behind.\nFiling Your Taxes Online\nOne of the most straightforward ways to file your federal taxes is with the IRS Free Filing Tool. It’s a service offered directly through the IRS; it doesn't use a third-party tax service. Anyone with an adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024 is qualified to use the free service.\nTo start, you’ll need to choose the “Free File” option from IRS.gov. From there, IRS Free File will send you to an IRS partner’s website to complete your return. These partners are software companies that are members of the nonprofit Free File Alliance, a coalition of companies that offer tax software services to US citizens free of charge.\nThis is a good option if your income falls within the qualification guidelines and your return is relatively straightforward, since this free service only has the most commonly filed forms. You’ll need to have documents ready, like a copy of last year's tax return, your social security number, and any W-2s. Once you’ve filed your federal tax return, you can check your online account for updates, and you’ll receive an email when the IRS has accepted your return.\nThe IRS website has a helpful step-by-step guide to walk you through the process, and even has IRS-certified volunteers to help with your taxes if you have a disability or speak limited English.\nSince the IRS Free Filing tool is only for federal taxes, you’ll need to also check your specific state for its tax-filing requirements. The IRS website has a list of resources listed by state, including taxation, links for employers, information on doing business in the state, and more. Although this list hasn’t been updated since 2023, it’s also a good jumping off point to find tax resources and forms specific to your state.\nIf you make more than $84,000 or your taxes are a little more complicated, like you own a small business, then the IRS Free Filing tool won’t work. You’ll need to do a little research to compare and see which is the best tax service for your needs, but here are some of the most popular tax services available:\n- FreeTaxUSA: A popular free tax service that, similar to the IRS Free Filing tool, lets you e-file your federal return for free directly to the IRS. You can also file state returns for just $15. Although FreeTaxUSA is super affordable, it includes services for more complicated filings, like home ownership, investments, and small businesses.\n- Cash App Taxes: The mobile finance tool similar to Venmo, Cash App has taken over for Credit Karma and provides free federal and state filing, and free audit defense. You can do your taxes through your computer or phone, and even easily snap a photo for your W-2 within the app. Reviewers have reported that Cash App Taxes doesn’t have as much support as paid services, and there is no expert tax help available if you need it. It’s missing some forms and tax topics, and users can’t import 1099s, so it's really only good for W-2 employees.\n- H&R Block: This familiar name has been a reliable tax service provider for over 70 years, and it has classic in-person help from a tax expert, along with easy-to-use online tax services. It’s on the pricier side, but H&R Block does provide more user-friendly and holistic services, including do-it-yourself online packages, Online Assist (which includes help from a tax expert), service from a tax preparer, and computer software. WIRED offers H&R Block coupons to save money if you decide to go with this service.\n- TurboTax: Another extremely popular tax service serving millions of users, TurboTax has free services for qualifying people, offering simple Form 1040 returns only. Along with self-service, there’s TurboTax Live Assisted, where you file online with tax expert help if needed; and TurboTax Full Service, where a tax expert will do your taxes and review them with you before filing. WIRED has TurboTax discount codes to save a little bit of cash if you decide to use this service.\nHow to File Taxes for an LLC or Small Business\nFiling taxes for small businesses or LLCs is a little trickier, and that’s where going with one of the tax services above—with advanced programs and expert help—can save you many headaches. Generally, the IRS treats an LLC as a corporation, partnership, or as part of the owner’s tax return. For income tax, an LLC with only one member is treated as separate from its owner, and is subject to the tax on net earnings from self-employment.\nIf the LLC is a partnership, normal partnership tax rules apply, and all partners will need to fill out a Form 1065, US Return of Partnership Income. Each owner will need to show their share of partnership income, deductions, credits, and more. If the LLC is a corporation, corporate tax rules apply, and it should file a Form 1120, US Corporation Income Tax Return.\nHow to File a Tax Extension\nAlright, so you didn't file early. We’re chronic procrastinators here, we get it. If you can’t file on time, you should file an extension by the tax deadline. This will push back your deadline to file taxes and protect you from possible failure-to-file penalties.\nIf you file an extension by tax day (April 15, 2025), it extends your filing deadline to six months later: October 15, 2025. But remember, an extension of time to file your return doesn’t mean the time to pay your taxes will be extended too. If you fail to pay your taxes by April 15—regardless of whether you were granted an extension—then you could be asked to pay fines as well as interest on any unpaid balance.\nWhat Happens if You Miss the Deadline?\nThis can result in penalties and interest, but if you file as soon as possible, you can minimize these penalties. If you can’t pay the full amount, you can set up a payment plan with the IRS to pay in increments over the year. If you forgot or just straight-up didn't file for an extension (and owe taxes), you can face a late-filing penalty maximum of 5 percent of the unpaid tax (4.5 percent late filing and 0.5 percent for late payment). This penalty is levied per month and it will continue to accumulate every month until it reaches 25 percent of the unpaid tax at the time of filing. The government also charges interest on unpaid amounts, which varies depending on your amount and time owed. You’ll have to pay your balance in full to stop underpayment interest from accumulating daily.\nHow Long Does It Take to Get a Tax Refund?\nThe IRS typically issues your refund within 21 days of receiving your e-filed federal return if there are no errors or issues (fingers crossed). If you go old-school and file a paper federal return, it typically takes twice as long, and could even take up to eight weeks to get a refund. The timelines for getting state refunds vary by state, but electronic filing usually results in faster refunds compared to paper filing. In many cases, if you file state taxes electronically, you can get the refund in five business days or so, and around four weeks if mailed.\nWhere’s My Tax Refund?\nWhen you file your federal income tax return, you can check the status of your tax refund on the IRS website or on its mobile app, IRS2Go. Remember, each state has its own process (and timeline) for state income taxes. Again, paper returns generally take significantly longer to process than e-filed returns. Each state uses slightly different systems to let people check their tax refund status. Generally, you’ll need two pieces of information to check your refund.\nTo check your status, you’ll need your Social Security number (SSN). (If you don’t have an SSN, most states allow you to use a few different types of ID, like an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN.) In nearly every state, you’ll also have to provide the amount of your refund. Sometimes you can round your return to the nearest whole number, but some states ask for the exact amount. Other states may also require additional information, like your date of birth, filing status, or zip code.\nI’d suggest checking your refund on the IRS website first. Just remember, this is the government, so your refund information may not be immediately available. Your refund status should appear around 24 hours after you e-file a current-year return, three or four days after you e-file a prior-year return, or four weeks after you file a paper return. (Remember, you’ll need your SSN or ITIN, filing status, and refund amount to check refund status.)\nWhat Are the Tax Brackets for 2024?\nUnsure of what tax rate you'll fall into? It all varies on whether you're single, married and filing jointly, married but filing separately, or the head of a household. The tax rate goes in increments, starting at 10 percent for bottom earners (making less than $11,600 as a single person), and increases up to 37 percent for single or head of household folks making more than $609,351.\nHere’s a quick chart showing the amounts for the projected tax brackets from 2024 to be filed in 2025.",

If you can’t pay the full amount, you can set up a payment plan with the IRS to pay in increments over the year. If you forgot or just straight-up didn't file for an extension (and owe taxes), you can face a late-filing <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.irs.gov/payments/failure-to-file-penalty\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.irs.gov/payments/failure-to-file-penalty\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/payments/failure-to-file-penalty\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">penalty</a> maximum of 5 percent of the unpaid tax (4.5 percent late filing and 0.5 percent for late payment). This penalty is levied <strong>per month</strong> and it will continue to accumulate every month until it reaches 25 percent of the unpaid tax at the time of filing. The government <em>also charges <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.irs.gov/payments/interest\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.irs.gov/payments/interest\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/payments/interest\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interest</a></em> on unpaid amounts, which varies depending on your amount and time owed. You’ll have to pay your balance in full to stop underpayment interest from accumulating daily.</p><p id=\"how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-tax-refund\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">How Long Does It Take to Get a Tax Refund?</h2></p><p class=\"paywall\">The IRS typically issues your <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/at-01-48.pdf\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/at-01-48.pdf\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/at-01-48.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">refund</a> within 21 days of receiving your e-filed federal return if there are no errors or issues (fingers crossed). If you go old-school and file a paper federal return, it typically takes twice as long, and could even take up to eight weeks to get a refund. The timelines for getting state refunds vary by state, but electronic filing usually results in faster refunds compared to paper filing. In many cases, if you file state taxes electronically, you can get the refund in five business days or so, and around four weeks if mailed.</p><p id=\"wheres-my-tax-refund\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Where’s My Tax Refund?</h2></p><p class=\"paywall\">When you file your federal income tax return, you can check the status of your tax refund on the <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.irs.gov/wheres-my-refund\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.irs.gov/wheres-my-refund\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/wheres-my-refund\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IRS website</a> or on its mobile app, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.irs.gov/help/irs2goapp\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.irs.gov/help/irs2goapp\" href=\"https://www.irs.gov/help/irs2goapp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IRS2Go</a>. Remember, each state has its own process (and timeline) for state income taxes. Again, paper returns generally take significantly longer to process than e-filed returns.

(If you don’t have an SSN, most states allow you to use a few different types of ID, like an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN.) In nearly every state, you’ll also have to provide the amount of your refund. Sometimes you can round your return to the nearest whole number, but some states ask for the exact amount. Other states may also require additional information, like your date of birth, filing status, or zip code.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I’d suggest checking your refund on the <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://sa.www4.irs.gov/wmr/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://sa.www4.irs.gov/wmr/\" href=\"https://sa.www4.irs.gov/wmr/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IRS website</a> first. Just remember, this is the government, so your refund information may not be immediately available. Your refund status should appear around 24 hours after you e-file a current-year return, three or four days after you e-file a prior-year return, or four weeks after you file a paper return.

    "content_text": "Far above your head, constellations of satellites are working constantly to provide the positioning, navigation, and timing systems that quietly run modern life. Known as the global navigation satellite system, or GNSS, signals from these satellites provide the foundation for mobile networks, energy grids, the internet, and GPS. And increasingly, their dependability is under threat.\nGPS signals can be jammed—deliberately drowned out with other powerful radio signals—and spoofed, where erroneous signals are released to fool positioning systems. GPS interference has been documented in Ukraine, the Middle East, and the South China Sea.\nBut startup SandboxAQ believes that artificial intelligence, when combined with navigation systems that read Earth’s magnetic field, known as MagNav, could mitigate these threats to GNSS. “Our technology does not replace [GNSS], but can enrich existing navigation systems to improve safety and serve as an alternative primary navigation source in case of GPS outages,” says Luca Ferrara, general manager of SandboxAQ’s navigation department.\nSandboxAQ’s navigation technology, called AQNav, uses quantum magnetometers—devices that can detect changes in magnetic fields very precisely by measuring subatomic particles—to produce a reading of the Earth’s magnetic field. “We are looking for the unique fingerprint of magnetized rock formations in the Earth’s crust,” says Ferrara.\nArtificial intelligence is then used to accurately pinpoint the position of an aircraft, through comparison with known maps of the magnetic field. The AI also eliminates any external interference generated by the aircraft, such as from sudden movements or signals from its electrical systems; individual aircraft have unique characteristics when it comes to introducing magnetic interference.\nSo far, the US Air Force, Boeing, and Airbus have all made test flights using the system. “Since May 2023, we have deployed and tested many iterations of our hardware and software,” Ferrara explains. “AQNav has flown hundreds of kilometers in different types of aircraft, from single-engine aircrafts to large military transports. It has been tested in real flight scenarios, including two major military exercises by the US Air Force.”\nSandboxAQ’s team—and inspiration for the idea—originated at Google’s parent company, Alphabet, between 2016 and 2022. The initial idea was to find applications for artificial intelligence and quantum technologies developed within Google’s moonshot factory.\nThen, in 2022, SandboxAQ was spun out from Alphabet, and founder and current CEO Jack Hidary set the company’s sights on any sector that needed high-profile AI solutions. Its work isn’t just limited to aerospace and navigation, says Ferrara. “Other technologies are producing critical advances in life sciences, chemistry and materials, financial services, cybernetics, and other areas,” he says.\nRight now, the AQNav technology isn’t ready for the market. Issues that still need solving include “integration into existing platforms and the design of a system robust enough to operate reliably on a global scale.” Specifically, the reliability of the software still needs to be improved, and the signal-processing techniques need to function well in a variety of environmental conditions. The system will also need to pass compliance with international flight standards. “Since AQNav, in its current stage of development, is not yet as precise and accurate as modern GNSS, in the immediate term it is more useful as a tool for flight safety, complementing existing navigation systems,” Ferrara says.\nBut in the longer term, he believes the tech could be widely used both in defense and in civilian aviation. The most recent reports from the International Air Transport Association and the European Union Agency for Aviation Safety have shown a dramatic increase in GPS interference and spoofing. “As aircraft automation increases, vulnerability of GNSS will only get worse. So this technology is seen as a key factor in making the skies safer today and potentially improving range tomorrow.” The maritime and drone-manufacturing industries have also expressed needs that could be met with special versions of the AQNav. “There are also interesting possibilities with cars and trains to be explored in the future,” Ferrara adds.\nThis story originally appeared on Wired Italia and has been translated from Italian.",

    "content_text": "For a while in the mid-2000s, a refrigerator-sized box in Abu Dhabi was considered the greatest chess player in the world. Its name was Hydra, and it was a small super-computer—a cabinet full of industrial-grade processors and specially designed chips, strung together with fiber-optic cables and jacked into the internet.\nAt a time when chess was still the main gladiatorial arena for competition between humans and AI, Hydra and its exploits were briefly the stuff of legend. The New Yorker published a contemplative 5,000-word feature about its emergent creativity; WIRED declared Hydra “fearsome”; and chess publications covered its victories with the violence of wrestling commentary. Hydra, they wrote, was a “monster machine” that “slowly strangled” human grand masters.\nTrue to form as a monster, Hydra was also isolated and strange. Other advanced chess engines at the time—Hydra’s rivals—ran on ordinary PCs and were available for anyone to download. But the full power of Hydra’s 32-processor cluster could be used by only one person at a time. And by the summer of 2005, even the members of Hydra’s development team were struggling to get a turn with their creation.\nThat’s because the team’s patron—the then 36-year-old Emirati man who’d hired them and put up the money for Hydra’s souped-up hardware—was too busy reaping his reward. On an online chess forum in 2005, Hydra’s Austrian chief architect, Chrilly Donninger, described this benefactor as the greatest “computer chess freak” alive. “The sponsor,” he wrote, “loves to play day and night with Hydra.”\nUnder the username zor_champ, the Emirati sponsor would log in to online chess tournaments and, with Hydra, play as a human-computer team. More often than not, they would trounce the competition. “He loved the power of man plus machine,” one engineer told me. “He loved to win.”\nHydra eventually got overtaken by other chess computers and was discontinued in the late 2000s. But zor_champ went on to become one of the most powerful, least understood men in the world. His real name is Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed al Nahyan.\nA bearded, wiry figure who’s almost never seen without dark sunglasses, Tahnoun is the United Arab Emirates’ national security adviser—the intelligence chief to one of the world’s wealthiest and most surveillance-happy small nations. He’s also the younger brother of the country’s hereditary, autocratic president, Mohamed bin Zayed al Nahyan. But perhaps most important, and most bizarrely for a spymaster, Tahnoun wields official control over much of Abu Dhabi’s vast sovereign wealth. Bloomberg News reported last year that he directly oversees a $1.5 trillion empire—more cash than just about anyone on the planet.\nIn his personal style, Tahnoun comes across as one-third Gulf royal, one-third fitness-obsessed tech founder, and one-third Bond villain. Among his many, many business interests, he presides over a sprawling tech conglomerate called G42 (a reference to the book The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, in which “42” is a super-computer’s answer to the question of “life, the universe, and everything”). G42 has a hand in everything from AI research to biotechnology—with special areas of strength in state-sponsored hacking and surveillance tech. Tahnoun is fanatical about Brazilian jiujitsu and cycling. He wears his sunglasses even at the gym because of a sensitivity to light, and he surrounds himself with UFC champions and mixed martial arts fighters.\nAccording to a businessman and a security consultant who’ve met with Tahnoun, visitors who make it past his layers of loyal gatekeepers might get a chance to speak with him only after cycling laps with the sheikh around his private velodrome. He has been known to spend hours in a flotation chamber, the consultant says, and has flown health guru Peter Attia into the UAE to offer guidance on longevity. According to a businessman who was present for the discussion, Tahnoun even inspired Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince, to cut back on fast food and join him in a quest to live to 150.\nBut in recent years, a new quest has taken up much of Sheikh Tahnoun’s attention. His onetime chess and technology obsession has morphed into something far bigger: a hundred-billion-dollar campaign to turn Abu Dhabi into an AI superpower. And the teammate he’s set out to buy this time is the United States tech industry itself.\nIn the multiplayer game of strategy that is the AI arms race, the US controls the board right now for a pretty simple reason. A single American hardware company, Nvidia, makes the chips that train the most competitive AI models—and the US government has moved to restrict who can buy these Nvidia GPUs (as the chips are called) outside the country’s borders. To take advantage of this clear but jittery lead over China, the CEOs of America’s AI giants have fanned out across the globe to sweet-talk the world’s richest investors—people like Tahnoun—into financing what amounts to an enormous building boom.\nLurking behind every synthetic podcast and serving of AI slop is a huge, thrumming data center: Hundreds of Hydra-sized server cabinets lined up in tight rows, running computing processes that are tens or hundreds of times more energy-intensive than ordinary web searches. And behind those is another set of data centers that train foundational AI models. To keep pace with demand, AI companies need more data centers all over the world—plus the land to put them on, the water to cool them, the electricity to power them, and the microchips to run them. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has predicted that tech companies will pour a trillion dollars into new AI data centers over the next five years.\nBuilding out the next phase of AI, in short, is set to require mind-boggling amounts of capital, real estate, and electricity—and the Gulf States, with their vast oil wealth and energy resources, possess all three. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar have all set up major AI investment funds in the past couple of years. But as a home for new data centers and a source of investment capital, the UAE has emerged as a particularly attractive potential partner on a number of fronts—from its sheer wealth to its brand-new nuclear power supply to the relative sophistication of its own AI sector.\nBut there’s a rub: Any American AI partnership with the UAE is, in some way, a relationship with Sheikh Tahnoun himself—and for years many of Tahnoun’s most important technology partners have been Chinese.\nThe pairing was only natural, given Tahnoun’s record as a spy chief with vast commercial interests in high-tech state control. Tahnoun spent the early 2020s forging deep business and personal ties with Beijing, to the point that some products sold by G42 came to be nearly indistinguishable from Chinese ones. A G42 subsidiary called Presight AI, for one, sold surveillance software to police forces worldwide that bore a close resemblance to systems used by Chinese law enforcement. The Chinese telecom giant Huawei’s footprints in G42 went even deeper. Early in the\ngenerative-AI boom, Huawei’s engineers moved freely through Abu Dhabi’s most sensitive tech facilities as they designed massive AI training centers.\nBut in August of 2023, Washington threw down a gauntlet. It restricted exports of Nvidia GPUs to the Middle East—the very hardware that Abu Dhabi needed to realize its own AI ambitions. No company using Huawei equipment would get access. So Tahnoun pivoted, hard. In early 2024, G42 announced it was severing ties with China and would rip out Chinese equipment. Chinese nationals began quietly departing Abu Dhabi’s tech sector.\nAt the same time, US and UAE leaders went into a fevered phase of mutual courtship. Scores of public relations consultants, lawyers, and Beltway lobbyists set about portraying Tahnoun as a safe pair of hands in which to place US technology and trust. Marty Edelman, the emirate’s most trusted American lawyer, helped orchestrate the strategy from New York. The UAE’s ambassador to Washington, Yousef Al Otaiba, deployed his considerable political capital to vouch for Tahnoun. Meanwhile, US government and tech leaders tried to maneuver what promised to be a huge spigot of Emirati money into the United States, to feed AI companies’ need for investment.\nThe first sign that the two sides had reached an understanding was, bizarrely, a deal that flowed in the opposite direction. In an unusual agreement brokered largely by officials in the Biden administration, Microsoft announced in April 2024 that it was investing $1.5 billion in Tahnoun’s G42, acquiring a minority stake in the company. According to remarks by a Biden official who helped steer the agreement, the objective was to get G42 to “work with Microsoft as an alternative to Huawei.” In the first phase of the relationship, G42 would gain access to Microsoft’s AI computing power on its Azure cloud platform, at a data center inside the UAE. And Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, would join the board of G42—a kind of American chaperone inside the company.\nThe big gushers of cash from the UAE were still to come, as were any Nvidia chips for Abu Dhabi. But the Microsoft deal amounted to a US government seal of approval for further business with the Emirates. In the summer of 2024, Tahnoun embarked on a charm offensive across the United States, with a visit to Elon Musk in Texas and a jiujitsu session with Mark Zuckerberg. Meetups with Bill Gates, Satya Nadella, and Jeff Bezos followed in quick succession. The most important meetings, however, took place at the White House, with figures like national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, and President Joe Biden himself.\nAs the frenzied campaign to reframe Tahnoun and G42’s image seemed to gain traction—and the US seemed poised to loosen export controls on advanced chips for the UAE—some inside the US national security establishment were, just as frantically, waving caution flags. One of their fears is that the intellectual property of the United States could still leak to China. “The Emiratis are the consummate hedgers,” a former senior US security official told me. “The question everyone has: Are they playing both sides?” In a July open letter, US congressman Michael McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called for “significantly more robust national security guardrails” to be placed on the UAE before the US exported any sensitive technology to the country.\nBut the other fear is of the UAE itself—a country whose vision of using AI as a mechanism of state control is not all that different from Beijing’s. “The UAE is an authoritarian state with a dismal human rights record and a history of using technology to spy on activists, journalists, and dissidents,” says Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “I don’t think there is any doubt that the UAE would like to influence the course of AI development”—in ways that are optimized not for democracy or any “shared human values,” but for police states.\nThis past summer, around the same time that Tahnoun was barnstorming through America’s dojos and C-suites, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, was hosting some of the world’s leading technology thinkers—including former Google CEO Eric Schmidt—at his vast South African hunting estate called Ekland. They visited game parks, were waited on by butlers, and discussed Saudi Arabia’s future role in AI.\nNot long after, Schmidt made a trip to the Biden White House to air his concerns that the US cannot produce enough electricity to compete in AI. His suggestion? Closer financial and business ties with hydroelectric-rich Canada. “The alternative is to have the Arabs fund [AI],” he told a group of Stanford students on video the following week. “I like the Arabs personally … But they’re not going to adhere to our national security rules.”\nThose concerns over the Gulf States’ reliability as allies (and their tendencies to engage in unsavory practices like targeting journalists and waging proxy wars) haven’t stopped their money from flowing into US tech companies. Earlier in the year, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign Public Investment Fund announced a $40 billion fund focused on AI investments, aided by a strategic partnership with the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Kingdom Holding, an investment firm run by a Saudi royal who is deeply obedient to the crown prince, has also emerged as one of the biggest investors in Elon Musk’s startup xAI.\nThe New York Times wrote that the new Saudi fund made that country “the world’s largest investor in artificial intelligence.” But in September, the UAE eclipsed it: Abu Dhabi announced that a new AI investment vehicle called MGX would partner with BlackRock, Microsoft, and Global Infrastructure Partners to pour more than $100 billion into, among other things, building a network of data centers and power plants across the United States. MGX—which is part of Tahnoun’s sovereign wealth portfolio—has also reportedly been in “early talks” with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman about what Altman hopes will be a 5 to 7 trillion-dollar moonshot chipmaking venture to create an alternative to Nvidia’s scarce GPUs.\nThe spigot of Emirati cash was now open. And in turn, within days of the MGX announcement, the news site Semafor reported that the US had cleared Nvidia to sell GPUs to G42. Some of the chips were already being deployed in Abu Dhabi, the news site reported, including “a sizable order of Nvidia H100 models.” The US had finally given Tahnoun some of the hardware he needed to build his next Hydra. Which raises the salience of two questions: What kind of game is Sheikh Tahnoun playing this time? And how exactly did he get control of so much wealth?\non some level, nearly every story about royalty in the Gulf is a story about succession—about paternalistic families trying to ward off external threats, and the internal rivalries that crop up when inherited power is up for grabs.\nTahnoun and his brother Mohamed are both sons of the UAE’s first president, Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan—an iconic figure revered as the father of the nation.\nFor much of Zayed’s life, what is now the city of Abu Dhabi was an austere, seasonal fishing village with a harsh climate, a brackish water supply, and a nomadic population of about 2,000 people. The rest of the emirate had several thousand more Bedouin inhabitants. As rulers, the al Nahyans were paid in tributes and taxes, and served as custodians of the emirate’s shared resources. Their lifestyle wasn’t all that much better than that of their fellow tribesmen. But still it was dangerous at the top. Before Zayed, two of the last four sheikhs of Abu Dhabi had been assassinated by their brothers; another had been killed by a rival tribe.\nZayed, for his part, seized power from his older brother in a bloodless coup aided by the British in 1966—just as oil and its transformative wealth started flowing into Abu Dhabi. Where his elder sibling resisted spending Abu Dhabi’s new fortune, Zayed embraced modernization, development, and a vision for uniting several tribes under a single state—setting the stage for the creation of the United Arab Emirates in 1971.\nWhen the UAE was formed, Tahnoun was almost 3 years old. A middle child among Zayed’s 20-odd sons, Tahnoun is one of the so-called Bani Fatima—the six male children of Zayed’s most favored wife, Fatima, and his most important heirs. Zayed groomed these sons to go abroad, become worldly, and take up the mantle of the UAE’s future. But even as he established a state that carefully distributed new oil wealth among Abu Dhabi’s Bedouins, Zayed steered his heirs away from business and self-enrichment. Perhaps mindful of the assassinations and coups that preceded him, Zayed wanted to ward off the perception that the al Nahyans were benefiting unfairly from their role as custodians of the country.\nIn the mid-1990s, Tahnoun found himself in Southern California. One day in 1995 he walked into a Brazilian jiujitsu dojo in San Diego, asking to be trained. He introduced himself as “Ben” and, according to an article on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Eastern Europe’s website, went out of his way to show humility, arriving early and helping to clean up. Only later did he reveal he was a prince of Abu Dhabi.\nAs Zayed’s health failed in the late 1990s, his sons began to step into bigger roles—and to break away from his guidance by starting businesses of their own. It was around this time that Tahnoun started his first holding company, the Royal Group, the entity he would use to incubate the Hydra chess computer. He also started a robotics company that produced a humanoid robot, REEM-C, which in turn was named after an island in Abu Dhabi where he made a series of real estate investments.\nWhen Zayed died in 2004, Tahnoun’s eldest brother, Kha-lifa, became the new ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the UAE, and Mohamed, the eldest of the Bani Fatima, became the crown prince. The other sons took on an array of official titles, but their roles were more ambiguous.\nAs a reporter based in Abu Dhabi from 2008 to 2011, I fell into the pastime of “sheikh watching,” a Gulf-royal version of Kremlinology that involves reading between the lines of announcements and moves, and keeping in touch with palace insiders who occasionally betray a few secrets. At the time, Tahnoun seemed like a fascinating dilettante very far from actual power—he held no serious role in the government and seemed preoccupied with growing his fortune, dabbling in technology, and changing the skyline of Abu Dhabi.\nThat all changed when Tahnoun stepped up as the family member with the greatest knack for wielding a growing tool for nation-states: cyberespionage.\nIn July 2009, thousands of BlackBerry users across the UAE noticed their phones growing dangerously hot. The culprit was a supposed “performance update” pushed by Etisalat, the UAE’s largest telecom provider. In reality, it was spyware—an early experiment in mass surveillance that backfired spectacularly when BlackBerry’s parent company exposed the scheme.\nI experienced this myself one day on a trip from Abu Dhabi to Dubai, bringing my BlackBerry to my ear and finding it so hot it nearly burned my face. It was my first direct, personal experience of the UAE’s hidden police state. But shades of its existence are apparent to anyone who has spent time in the Gulf States. Violent crime is nearly nonexistent, and life can be smooth, even luxurious. But in moments of stress or risk, these countries can become very dangerous places, especially for residents who dare hint at dissent.\nThe revolutions of the Arab Spring in 2011—which saw four Middle Eastern autocrats topple in the face of massive, Twitter-organized crowds—only heightened the UAE’s resolve to stamp out any green shoots of democracy. When a handful of Emirati activists made their own mild case for human rights and political reform in 2011, the state convicted them on charges of royal defamation. Then it promptly pardoned and released them into a life of surveillance and harassment.\nWhile there’s no evidence that Tahnoun had any direct involvement in the BlackBerry debacle, he would soon come to oversee an empire capable of far more sophisticated spycraft. In 2013, he was named deputy national security adviser—around which time the UAE’s ambitions to spy on its residents and enemies started to reach an industrial scale.\nFor several years at that point, the UAE had been running a secret program known as Project Raven, formed in 2008 under a contract with consultant and former US counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke. The US National Security Agency had blessed the arrangement, meant to give the UAE state-of-the-art surveillance and data analysis capabilities to contribute to the war on terror. But around 2014, Project Raven took a new tack. Under the new management of a US contractor called CyberPoint, it recruited dozens of former US intelligence operatives with a simple pitch: tax-free salaries, housing stipends, and a chance to fight terrorism.\nBut fighting terrorism was, in fact, only part of the agenda. Within two years, the project’s management changed hands yet again to a company called Dark-Matter, effectively an Emirati state-owned firm. Emirati intelligence leaders placed Project Raven under their own roof—just two floors from the UAE’s own version of the NSA. The message to Project Raven’s employees: Join DarkMatter or leave.\nFor those who remained, the job included tracking journalists, dissidents, and other perceived enemies of the state and the royal family. Among the key American operatives who stayed on with DarkMatter was Marc Baier, a veteran of the NSA’s elite Tailored Access Operations unit. Emails later showed Baier chatting with the Italian surveillance firm Hacking Team, describing his UAE clients as “the most senior” and demanding white-glove service as he shopped for hacking tools. Other former NSA hackers on the Project Raven team got busy developing custom attacks for specific devices and accounts.\nThey got to human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor—one of the Emiratis who had blogged in favor of democratic reform during the Arab Spring—through his child’s baby monitor. It was 2016, and Mansoor had grown used to his devices behaving strangely: phones that grew mysteriously hot, suspicious text messages, drained bank accounts, according to a person familiar with his experiences. His phone had even once been infected with Pegasus spyware, a notorious product made by the Israeli cyber-arms firm NSO Group. But the baby monitor was new. Unknown to him, operatives at DarkMatter were using it to listen to his family’s private conversations.\nIn another project, DarkMatter assembled what it called a “tiger team”—a task force to install mass-surveillance hardware in public places. These probes would be capable of “intercepting, modifying, and diverting” nearby traffic on UAE’s cellular networks, according to an Italian security researcher who was being courted by DarkMatter in 2016. “To operate as we want them to, these probes are going to be put everywhere,” the prospective hire, Simone Margaritelli, was told in an email during his recruitment process.\nAnd who was ultimately overseeing all this activity? In early 2016, Tahnoun had been named national security adviser, which placed him fully in charge of UAE intelligence. And there are signs that the ultimate controlling party over DarkMatter was none other than Tahnoun’s investment firm, the Royal Group.\nEventually, I may have become a target of the UAE’s hacking apparatus myself. In 2021 a coalition of journalists called the Pegasus Project informed me that my phone had been targeted by the UAE using Pegasus spyware in 2018. At the time I’d been reporting on a global financial scandal that implicated a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family—Sheikh Tahnoun’s brother, Mansour. The UAE denied that it had targeted many of the people identified, including me.\nThe hacking and tracking of American citizens would eventually become a red line for some of Project Raven’s former intelligence agents. “I am working for a foreign intelligence agency who is targeting US persons,” a Project Raven whistleblower named Lori Stroud would tell Reuters in 2019. “I am officially the bad kind of spy.”\nThe ensuing scandal resulted in US federal charges for several of its ex-NSA leaders, including Baier. DarkMatter and Project Raven, meanwhile, were painstakingly broken down, scattered, rebranded, and then subsumed into other companies and government departments. Many of their pieces and personnel eventually moved under the umbrella of a single new entity founded in 2018—called G42.\nG42 has denied publicly it had any connections to Dark-Matter, but the threads aren’t hard to see. One DarkMatter subsidiary, for instance, was an entity that worked especially closely with Chinese companies. Not only did it eventually appear to become part of G42, but the subsidiary’s CEO, Peng Xiao, went on to become the CEO of G42 itself.\nA Chinese speaker who studied computer science at Hawaii Pacific University, Xiao’s past is otherwise a black box. Though he was a US citizen for a time, he eventually surrendered his US passport for UAE citizenship—an exceedingly rare honor for a non-Emirati. And under a subsidiary of G42 called Pax AI, Xiao helped produce the next evolutionary step in DarkMatter’s legacy.\nOne morning in 2019, millions of phones across the UAE lit up with a cheery notification. A new messaging app called ToTok promised what WhatsApp couldn’t—unrestricted calling in a country where the voice-calling function of most chat apps was blocked. Within weeks, it had shot to the top of Apple’s and Google’s app store even beyond the Emirates. But there was a catch. Each time someone tapped the app icon, the user gave the app access to everything on that phone—photos, messages, the camera, voice calls, location.\nData from millions of phones flowed to Pax AI. Like DarkMatter before it, Pax AI operated from the same building as the UAE’s intelligence agency. The ToTok app itself came from a collaboration with Chinese engineers. For a regime that had spent fortunes on NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware and DarkMatter’s hacking teams, ToTok was elegantly simple. People didn’t have to be laboriously targeted with spyware—they were eagerly downloading it.\nRepresentatives of ToTok adamantly denied that their product was spyware, but an engineer who worked at G42 at the time told me that all of the voice, video, and text chats were analyzed by AI for what the government considered suspicious activity. (Among the easiest ways to get flagged: placing calls to Qatar, then a rival in a mutual cyberwar, from within the UAE.) G42 declined to comment on specific details for this story but responded to WIRED with an overall statement: “G42 is steadfast in its commitment to responsible innovation, ethical governance, and delivering transformative AI solutions globally.”\nInside G42, staff sometimes refer to Tahnoun as “Tiger,” and his orders can swiftly change the company’s course. One mandate from Tiger, according to a former engineer, was to build him either a business that generates $100 million in revenue a year or a technology that makes him famous. In the workplace, there is no mistaking that the conglomerate has one foot inside the security state: Most of the company’s technology and data centers are based in Zayed Military City, a restricted-access zone, and all G42 staff need to pass security clearances to get hired.\nThrough G42, government intelligence services, and other cybersecurity entities, Tahnoun had effectively come to oversee the UAE’s entire hacking apparatus. But at a certain point, control over the UAE’s spy sector and the industry around it wasn’t enough for Tahnoun.\nBy the turn of the decade, Tahnoun had ambitions for more political power over the whole of the Emirates. His sibling Mohamed had been serving as the de facto leader of the country since their brother President Kha-lifa suffered a major stroke in 2014. Now, as Khalifa’s health continued to fail and Mohamed’s formal accession to the throne was becoming imminent, the position of the next crown prince was up for grabs.\nThese moments of dynastic uncertainty can be dangerous. In Saudi Arabia, the sons of the country’s first king, Abdulaziz al-Saud, have taken the throne one after the other ever since the 1950s. By the time the current king, Salman, took power in 2015, he was 80 years old, and the ranks of potential heirs below him had become crowded, corrupt, and rife with internal tensions. That’s why, in 2017, King Salman’s son Mohammed, or MBS, struck out to eliminate his rivals—mostly cousins and their aides—by arresting them in a purge, asserting himself as the new strongman.\nIn Abu Dhabi, Tahnoun’s argument in the succession debate, according to royal insiders, was that his brother Mohamed should follow precedent and allow the sons of Zayed to rule while they were of good health and sound mind—a system that would place him in contention. But Mohamed was adamant that his own son Khalid should be crown prince, a signal to the country’s large youth population that they were represented high up in government.\nTahnoun argued his point for more than a year, even providing evidence that Mohamed’s plan contradicted their father’s request for succession. But in the end, the brothers worked out a deal. Tahnoun agreed to set aside his ambition to be the crown prince or ruler—in exchange for vast power over the country’s financial resources. It was this bargain that would ultimately put him in charge of $1.5 trillion in sovereign wealth.\nIn 2023, Tahnoun was made chairman of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the largest and most important sovereign wealth fund in the country. Khalid’s appointment as crown prince was announced weeks later.\nOfficially, Tahnoun got a modest bump in title to become deputy ruler along with his brother Hazza. But those dealing with Abu Dhabi over the past few years say the same thing: Tahnoun’s powers have increased by an extraordinary degree, and not just in finance. He has also taken over diplomacy with Iran, Qatar, and Israel, and even handled the United States for a time when relations with the Biden administration declined. “Whenever there’s a difficult file, it’s given to Tahnoun,” says Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a scholar of Gulf politics at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. That skill has helped him “grow his power enormously,” Ulrichsen says.\nAs Tahnoun has gained access to new resources, he has plowed them into his maze of investments and conglomerates. Under the Royal Group, he controls not only G42 but also another conglomerate called the International Holding Company—itself a massive consortium that employs more than 50,000 people and owns everything from a Zambian copper mine to the St. Regis golf club and island resort in Abu Dhabi. He also oversees First Abu Dhabi Bank, which is the UAE’s largest lender, and another multibillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund called ADQ.\nAnd now, with a growing position in the global AI arms race, Tahnoun’s empire also includes a stake in the future of humanity.\nIn December, the US government confirmed it had authorized the export of some Nvidia GPUs to the UAE—specifically to a Microsoft-operated facility inside the country. At G42, subsidiaries have kept multi-plying: Space42 focuses on using AI to analyze satellite imaging data; Core42 aims to build massive AI data centers across Abu Dhabi’s deserts.\nInside the US security establishment, many remain worried about the US tech sector’s increasingly close relationship with the UAE. One unsettling fact, according to a former security official, was that China made no protest over Tahnoun’s decision to tear out all of Huawei’s equipment and sever ties with the company in 2023. “They didn’t raise a peep,” the official told me. When Sweden banned Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE from its 5G rollout in 2020, Beijing’s foreign ministry spoke out against it, and Swedish telecom giant Ericsson lost huge amounts of business in China in retaliation. By contrast, G42’s big breakup with China somehow got a pass—suggesting to the official that there may be some kind of backdoor understanding between the two nations.\nIn a statement to WIRED, US congressman Michael McCaul reiterated his concern that technology could leak to China through the UAE’s deal with Microsoft, and stressed the need for tighter guardrails. “Before advancing this partnership and others like it further, the US must first establish robust, legally binding protections that apply broadly to AI cooperation with the UAE,” he said.\nBut even if those guardrails were put into place, the UAE has a history of finding ways to do what it wants. I’m reminded of the briefings that executives from Israel’s NSO Group gave to journalists for a time in the early 2010s, assuring them that Pegasus spyware had safeguards against abuse—and that Pegasus clients (like the UAE) would be blocked from targeting US and UK phone numbers (like mine). And I’m reminded of the blessings that the NSA gave to Project Raven at its inception.\nWhile Donald Trump and his new administration are expected to continue with export controls over GPU chips, the view from people inside Tahnoun’s orbit is that the new administration will likely be much more “flexible” about the UAE’s AI ambitions. Plus at least one Trumpworld insider has a vested interest in the relationship: The UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia have together contributed more than $2 billion to Jared Kushner’s private equity fund, guaranteeing the fund some $20 million to $30 million in annual management fees alone. Abu Dhabi’s leaders have consulted with Kushner and other Trump insiders, including former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, on AI policy, according to people familiar with the discussions.\nWhile the continued supply of GPUs could be a remaining source of leverage for the US, it could be a declining one as rival chips improve. Some analysts argue that, even now, export controls are not the source of strength that American officials think they are. “AI is not like nuclear power where you can restrict the materials,” says computer security expert Bruce Schneier. AI technology is already highly distributed, he says, and the idea that American companies are at a huge and absolute advantage is a mirage.\nNow that Tahnoun has been “brought inside the tent”—and given a key and expanding role as an investor of choice for the current winners in the AI race—he has certainly succeeded in gaining some leverage of his own. And those who keep needing money from the UAE may be happy to see it gain more clout. At a World Government Summit last year, Sam Altman suggested that the UAE could even serve as the world’s “regulatory sandbox” for AI—a place where new rules for governing the technology can get written, tested, and advanced.\nMeanwhile, the Middle East could be entering a period, like the aftermath of the Arab Spring, when rules are largely off the table. Now that rebels have taken over Syria from the regime of Bashar al Assad, the Gulf States—especially the UAE—will be anxious to increase surveillance to avoid any spread of Islamist unrest. “We’re going to see more repression, more use of surveillance technologies,” says Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. And when it comes to managing threats and winning games of strategy, Tahnoun likes to make sure he’s playing with the most fearsome machine in the world.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

Its name was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2005/12/computers-still-dominate-chess/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hydra</a>, and it was a small super-computer—a cabinet full of industrial-grade processors and specially designed chips, strung together with fiber-optic cables and jacked into the internet.</p><p class=\"paywall\">At a time when chess was still the main gladiatorial arena for competition between humans and AI, Hydra and its exploits were briefly the stuff of legend. The New Yorker <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/12/your-move\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> a contemplative 5,000-word feature about its emergent creativity; WIRED declared Hydra “<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2005/07/chess-vs-chess960-a-pcs-view/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fearsome</a>”; and chess publications covered its victories with the violence of wrestling commentary. Hydra, they wrote, was a “monster machine” that “slowly strangled” human grand masters.</p><p class=\"paywall\">True to form as a monster, Hydra was also isolated and strange. Other advanced chess engines at the time—Hydra’s rivals—ran on ordinary PCs and were available for anyone to download. But the full power of Hydra’s 32-processor cluster could be used by only one person at a time. And by the summer of 2005, even the members of Hydra’s development team were struggling to get a turn with their creation.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">That’s because the team’s patron—the then 36-year-old Emirati man who’d hired them and put up the money for Hydra’s souped-up hardware—was too busy reaping his reward. On an online chess forum in 2005, Hydra’s Austrian chief architect, Chrilly Donninger, described this benefactor as the greatest “computer chess freak” alive. “The sponsor,” he wrote, “loves to play day and night with Hydra.”</p><p class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe iDXPAN callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Under the username zor_champ, the Emirati sponsor would log in to online chess tournaments and, with Hydra, play as a human-computer team. More often than not, they would trounce the competition. “He loved the power of man plus machine,” one engineer told me. “He loved to win.”</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">Hydra eventually got overtaken by other chess computers and was discontinued in the late 2000s. But zor_champ went on to become one of the most powerful, least understood men in the world. His real name is Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed al Nahyan.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A bearded, wiry figure who’s almost never seen without dark sunglasses, Tahnoun is the United Arab Emirates’ national security adviser—the intelligence chief to one of the world’s wealthiest and most surveillance-happy small nations. He’s also the younger brother of the country’s hereditary, autocratic president, Mohamed bin Zayed al Nahyan. But perhaps most important, and most bizarrely for a spymaster, Tahnoun wields official control over much of Abu Dhabi’s vast sovereign wealth. Bloomberg News reported last year that he directly oversees a $1.5 trillion empire—more cash than just about anyone on the planet.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In his personal style, Tahnoun comes across as one-third Gulf royal, one-third fitness-obsessed tech founder, and one-third Bond villain. Among his many, many business interests, he presides over a sprawling tech conglomerate called G42 (a reference to the book <em>The</em> <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,</em> in which “42” is a super-computer’s answer to the question of “life, the universe, and everything”). G42 has a hand in everything from AI research to biotechnology—with special areas of strength in state-sponsored hacking and surveillance tech. Tahnoun is fanatical about Brazilian jiujitsu and cycling. He wears his sunglasses even at the gym because of a sensitivity to light, and he surrounds himself with UFC champions and mixed martial arts fighters.</p><p class=\"paywall\">According to a businessman and a security consultant who’ve met with Tahnoun, visitors who make it past his layers of loyal gatekeepers might get a chance to speak with him only after cycling laps with the sheikh around his private velodrome. He has been known to spend hours in a flotation chamber, the consultant says, and has flown health guru Peter Attia into the UAE to offer guidance on longevity. According to a businessman who was present for the discussion, Tahnoun even inspired Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince, to cut back on fast food and join him in a quest to live to 150.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "The scam ecosystem has been booming around the world, with criminals honing a handful of strategies to trick victims into voluntarily sending their money into the abyss. And as the cash—or, typically, cryptocurrency—flows in, a set of digital services and infrastructure offerings have increasingly emerged. The scam economy helps criminals with everything from creating fake social media pages to buying SIM cards—and, crucially, with money laundering. Now, researchers say that in the pantheon of dark web marketplaces, the “largest illicit online marketplace” ever is now one that sells services to other scammers rather than focusing on drugs or other contraband.\nNew findings from the crypto-tracing firm Elliptic show how one of the biggest players in that sphere, Huione Guarantee, has likely enabled $24 billion in gray market transactions—with the volume of activity on the platform rocketing up 51 percent since initial investigations last summer. At the same time, the platform is offering more services than ever, including launching its own messaging app, stablecoin, and cryptocurrency exchange. Expanding the empire means more profits for administrators, but it may also be part of an effort to, according to Elliptic, flood the zone and protect Huione Guarantee from potential law enforcement action or technological crackdowns.\n“What platforms really do is help scammers to scale up their operations, and it’s really enabled the industrialization of online scams,” says Tom Robinson, Elliptic’s cofounder and chief scientist. “Huione Guarantee is a key node in this network of facilitators of online scams. Preventing it from operating would have a significant impact on online scams and would have an immediate beneficial effect on victims and potential victims.”\nA Chinese-language platform that has wider links to businesses associated with the Cambodian ruling family, Huione Guarantee first emerged in 2021 as investment scams—or so-called “pig butchering” scams—from Southeast Asia boomed. One of the platform’s centerpiece features is a deposit and escrow service, connecting buyers and sellers to help facilitate their transactions. But the service also acts as a general store that fulfills every scammer’s needs, with sellers hawking victim contact details, deepfake tools to trick targets, fake investment websites, and more.\nHuione Guarantee mostly operates through the social media app Telegram, organized around groups and bots that have tens of thousands of members and followers. Transactions typically take place using the Tether stablecoin. Telegram did not return WIRED’s request for comment about Huione Guarantee’s activity and growth on its platform. Tether also did not respond to a request for comment.\nHuione Guarantee itself did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment. However, last year, following the publication of Elliptic’s previous research, Huione Guarantee posted a statement to its website where it claimed to be an “information publishing and guarantee trading platform,” and the services “are provided by third-party merchants and we only provide guarantee services.” The company also said that after it saw Elliptic’s previous report, it removed some sellers.\nAdding an in-house communication service known as “ChatMe,” a cryptocurrency exchange (Huione Crypto), and US dollar-backed stablecoin (“USDH”) suggests that Huione Guarantee is looking to become a truly full-service, self-sufficient platform. The website for USDH, the Elliptic researchers say, describes it as “not restricted” by regulators around the world and says that it “avoids the common freezing and transfer restrictions” that can be applied to other cryptocurrencies.\nIn its work last year, Elliptic found that in the first three years of its operation, Huione Guarantee sellers moved around $11 billion on the platform. Less than a year later, the researchers now estimate that cumulative total to be $24 billion. The platform’s various expansions are all contributing to the increase, but ultimately its escrow and transfer services are the core service.\n“With Huione Guarantee, the primary thing being sold is actually laundering of the proceeds of online scams,” Robinson alleges. “The vast majority of the funds that are going through the marketplace is in relation to vendors that are openly offering money laundering services who talk about the types of fraud proceeds that they’re willing to accept.”\nMeanwhile, as business booms, the researchers say that the platform’s owner, Huione Group, has worked to downplay its association with the marketplace and the connection between Huione Guarantee and other linked services, like Huione Pay. The marketplace has even been rebranded as “Haowang Guarantee,” though Huione Group confirmed to the researchers that Huione Guarantee is still a “strategic partner and shareholder.”\n“The Huione Guarantee Group on Telegram continues to be used extensively, with over 139,000 users,” says Jason Tower, the country director for Myanmar at the United States Institute of Peace. “Telegram groups are used to move large sums of cryptocurrencies at a significant discount. By comparison, competing platforms have lost a significant number of users. This is likely a result of crackdowns by the Chinese government.”\nRobinson says an initial analysis from Elliptic has found around $6 billion passing through one Telegram bot that is allegedly “used primarily for online gambling on Huione Guarantee.” The researchers’ analysis suggests this may also be allegedly linked to money laundering. Users deposit crypto into a wallet and then can move their balance into individual minigames that exist in their own Telegram groups. The “games” are extremely rudimentary, though, and don’t seem to involve any skill. Players also tend to bet consistently over very long periods of time, wager similar amounts, and leave precise intervals between their bets. All of this “together suggests automated gambling for the purposes of money laundering rather than entertainment,” Robinson alleges.\nIn spite of Huione Guarantee’s apparent too-big-to-fail strategy, the Elliptic researchers say that the platform is far from being totally self-sufficient. So far, Huione’s stablecoin and cryptocurrency exchange have failed to register significant volumes of transactions, Robinson says, despite some promotion within its existing communications channels. As the marketplace works to push the transition, its ongoing reliance on third parties could still be a weakness—at least for now.\n“Huione Guarantee is still dependent on certain centralized infrastructure, Tether and Telegram,” Robinson says. “I think there is an opportunity now to suppress it through those service providers. I think if we wait too long, then there is a chance that they move to their own infrastructure and that becomes more challenging.”",

The platform’s various expansions are all contributing to the increase, but ultimately its escrow and transfer services are the core service.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“With Huione Guarantee, the primary thing being sold is actually laundering of the proceeds of online scams,” Robinson alleges. “The vast majority of the funds that are going through the marketplace is in relation to vendors that are openly offering money laundering services who talk about the types of fraud proceeds that they’re willing to accept.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Meanwhile, as business booms, the researchers say that the platform’s owner, Huione Group, has worked to downplay its association with the marketplace and the connection between Huione Guarantee and other linked services, like Huione Pay. The marketplace has even been rebranded as “Haowang Guarantee,” though Huione Group confirmed to the researchers that Huione Guarantee is still a “strategic partner and shareholder.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">“The Huione Guarantee Group on Telegram continues to be used extensively, with over 139,000 users,” says Jason Tower, the country director for Myanmar at the United States Institute of Peace. “Telegram groups are used to move large sums of cryptocurrencies at a significant discount. By comparison, competing platforms have lost a significant number of users. This is likely a result of <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/casinos-cambodia-myanmar-laos-southeast-asia-fraud-cybercrime\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">crackdowns</a> by the Chinese government.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Robinson says an initial analysis from Elliptic has found around $6 billion passing through one Telegram bot that is allegedly “used primarily for online gambling on Huione Guarantee.” The researchers’ analysis suggests this may also be allegedly linked to money laundering. Users deposit crypto into a wallet and then can move their balance into individual minigames that exist in their own Telegram groups. The “games” are extremely rudimentary, though, and don’t seem to involve any skill. Players also tend to bet consistently over very long periods of time, wager similar amounts, and leave precise intervals between their bets. All of this “together suggests automated gambling for the purposes of money laundering rather than entertainment,” Robinson alleges.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In spite of Huione Guarantee’s apparent too-big-to-fail strategy, the Elliptic researchers say that the platform is far from being totally self-sufficient. So far, Huione’s stablecoin and cryptocurrency exchange have failed to register significant volumes of transactions, Robinson says, despite some promotion within its existing communications channels. As the marketplace works to push the transition, its ongoing reliance on third parties could still be a weakness—at least for now.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“Huione Guarantee is still dependent on certain centralized infrastructure, Tether and Telegram,” Robinson says. “I think there is an opportunity now to suppress it through those service providers. I think if we wait too long, then there is a chance that they move to their own infrastructure and that becomes more challenging.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "A British judge ruled against a man who wants to excavate a landfill where he says a hard drive with access to thousands of bitcoins was mistakenly dumped over 11 years ago.\nSince 2013, James Howells has been hoping to recover a laptop hard drive that he says contains the private key for cryptocurrency which he says he mined in 2009. Ars wrote about it at the time, noting that the value of a bitcoin had just passed $1,000, making 7,500 bitcoins worth $7.5 million.\nThe alleged number of bitcoins has changed a bit, with Howells now saying he lost 8,000 bitcoins. The bitcoin price exceeded $100,000 last month and was $95,636 as of last Friday, or $765 million for 8,000 bitcoins.\nHigh Court judge Keyser KC issued his ruling last week, siding with the defendant in Howells v. Newport City Council. Howells has no realistic chance of success at trial, the judge ruled. Howells sought “an order that the defendant either deliver the hard drive or allow his team of experts to excavate the landfill in order to find it, and (in the alternative) compensation equivalent to the value of the Bitcoin that he can no longer access.”\nLandfill Authority Owns the Trash\nThe council said that excavating the landfill site would let harmful substances escape into the environment, endangering residents with “potentially serious risks which raises public health issues and environmental concerns,” the ruling said.\nThe judge found no “reasonable grounds for bringing this case,” saying it has “no realistic prospect of succeeding if it went to trial and that there is no other compelling reason why it should be disposed of at trial.” He granted summary judgment for the defendant, dismissing the claim.\nThe ruling quotes the Control of Pollution Act 1974, which states that “anything delivered to the authority by another person in the course of using the facilities shall belong to the authority and may be dealt with accordingly.” Howells “submitted that section 14(6)(c) merely says that anything so delivered shall belong to the authority but does not say that it shall cease to belong to its former owner,” the ruling said. The judge disagreed, writing that “the words ‘shall belong to the authority’ are unqualified and unrestricted.”\nThe judge found no reason to determine that the defendant retaining the hard drive is “unconscionable” under the law. “In my view there would be no realistic prospect of a finding that the defendant's retention of the Hard Drive was unconscionable. The defendant was not retaining it for gain or because it wanted it. It was retaining it because it was buried in landfill,” the ruling said.\nStatute of Limitations\nThe claim is also barred by the six-year statute of limitations because Howells “knew the facts material to his claim by November 2013 but did not commence proceedings until May 2024,” the ruling said.\nThe judge didn't need to rule on whether the hard drive really contains access to bitcoin, saying that “the only relevant issues in this case concern ownership of, and rights of access to, the Hard Drive.” Howells sought access to the landfill site in Newport, Wales, starting in November 2013, but local officials refused. He says the hard drive is 2½ inches in size and has a wallet.dat file containing a private key that can enable access to the bitcoin.\nThe city council said excavation would breach the terms of its license with NRW (Natural Resources Body for Wales), cause health and safety risks for staff, risk damage from ground movement during or after excavation work, and prevent the council from “discharg[ing] its statutory waste disposal functions whilst the site is excavated.”\nAfter his November 2013 outreach, Howells “made repeated requests to the defendant for access to the Site in order to find and retrieve the Hard Drive, but these were largely ignored by the defendant,” the ruling said. “The claimant then set about securing investment and expertise to enable a team of experts to undertake a landfill excavation and recovery operation and in 2023 he began to advance his case formally to the defendant.”\n“This Ruling Has Taken Everything From Me”\nThe BBC yesterday quoted Howells as saying that “the case being struck out at the earliest hearing doesn't even give me the opportunity to explain myself or an opportunity for justice in any shape or form. There was so much more that could have been explained in a full trial and that's what I was expecting.”\n“It's not about greed, I'm happy to share the proceeds but nobody in a position of power will have a decent conversation with me … This ruling has taken everything from me and left me with nothing. It's the great British injustice system striking again,” he said.\nIn January 2021, CNN wrote that Howells “has offered to pay the council a quarter of the current value of the hoard, which he says could be distributed to local residents.”\nWhy the Hard Drive Was Dumped\nAs for how the hard drive went to the landfill, Howells claims it “was taken from his home without his permission or consent on the morning of 5th August 2013,” the ruling said.\nHis ex-girlfriend, Halfina Eddy-Evans, said in a recent interview with The Daily Mail that she brought the hard drive and other unwanted belongings to the dump at Howells’ request. “I thought he should be running his errands, not me, but I did it to help out … I'd love nothing more than him to find it. I'm sick and tired of hearing about it,” she said.\nThe ruling describes Howells’ version of the 2013 event as follows:\nThe ruling cited testimony that “the landfill contains around 350,000 tonnes of waste with a further 50,000 tonnes added annually. Once the skip at the reception area is full, the waste is emptied into the landfill, where it is then covered with inert material to minimise the release of gases or liquids and then compacted.”\nHowells Thinks Data Can Be Recovered\nHowells believes the hard drive may still be usable, according to a 2021 New Yorker article. “Although the covering of the drive was metal, the disk inside was glass,” reporter D. T. Max wrote. “‘It's actually coated in a cobalt layer that is anti-corrosive,’ Howells told me. He conceded that the hard drive would have been subjected to some compacting when it was layered in with soil and other trash. But, however rough the process, it might not have fractured the disk and destroyed the drive's contents.”\nThe 2021 CNN report quoted Howells as saying he wanted to “dig a specific area of the landfill based on a grid reference system and recover the hard drive whilst adhering to all safety and environmental standards. The drive would then be presented to data recovery specialists who can rebuild the drive from scratch with new parts and attempt to recover the tiny piece of data that I need in order to access the bitcoins.”\nYesterday's ruling said that according to a report prepared for Howells, \"in November 2013 the Hard Drive was ‘probably’ located ‘within an area of approximately 2,000 square metres of the site’ and ‘within an approximate volume of 10,000-15,000 tonnes of waste.’”\n“It would be a criminal offence for the claimant or anyone acting for him to sort over or disturb any refuse deposited at the Site, unless he were authorised to do so by the defendant: see section 27 of CPA 1974 and section 60 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990,” the ruling said. “The defendant could only give such authorisation, or excavate the Site itself, if it were first to apply for and obtain a new environmental permit from NRW, as the Schedule of permitted activities in its existing permit does not allow excavation of the Site.”\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "As TikTok anxiously awaits a Supreme Court decision that could determine whether it will be banned in the United States, users are preemptively fleeing the app and migrating to another Chinese social media platform called Xiaohongshu, which literally means “little red book” in Mandarin. As of Monday, Xiaohongshu was the number one most-downloaded app in Apple’s US App Store, despite the fact that it doesn’t even have an official English name. The second app on the list is Lemon8, another social media app owned by TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, that is also experiencing a traffic surge from exiled TikTok users.\nOver the weekend, thousands of people began swarming to Xiaohongshu, which is known in China as a platform for travel and lifestyle content and has over 300 million users. The newcomers, who refer to the app as “RedNote” or “the Chinese version of Instagram” and call themselves “TikTok refugees,” are relying on translation tools to navigate Xiaohongshu’s mostly Chinese ecosystem. Some say they are hoping to rebuild communities they had on TikTok, while others say they joined the app out of spite and to undermine the US government’s decision to ban TikTok over concerns that the Chinese government could use the app to surveil Americans.\n“I would rather stare at a language I can't understand than to ever use a social media [platform] that Mark Zuckerberg owns,” said one user in a video posted to Xiaohongshu on Sunday. There are a countless number of similar clips in which TikTok refugees introduce themselves and explain why they decided to come to Xiaohongshu, many raking up thousands of likes and comments each. A spokesperson for Xiaohongshu could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Friday from TikTok and the US government, which respectively made their cases for and against a law passed last year that would force TikTok to sell its US operations or be banned by January 19. Experts said the justices appeared to think the law was constitutional and would likely allow it to stay, leaving many users feeling that the app’s days are numbered. While TikTok is unlikely to immediately disappear from the phones of people who have already downloaded it, it could be deleted from US app stores, causing many to panic and look for the next place to go.\nSome users are predictably going to Instagram or YouTube, but others say they would like to stick to a platform developed by a Chinese company to protest the decisions by US lawmakers that led to this situation. “Telling me to download Rednote out of spite over the TikTok ban was the only push I needed actually,” one person wrote on Bluesky. Internet culture journalist Taylor Lorenz also shared a link to her Xiaohongshu account on Bluesky, calling the platform “the hottest new social app in America.”\nAt least so far, pettiness and revenge appear to be enough to motivate people to learn how to navigate Xiaohongshu, an app that is overwhelmingly used by Chinese-speaking people and was not designed with English-speaking users in mind. “I have no idea what I’m doing here. I can’t even read the rules,” one TikTok refugee who goes by “Elle belle” said in a post on the app.\n\"Hello everyone, my name is Ryan. I'm a TikTok refugee. The American government is banning TikTok so we are looking for an alternative … We are very sorry to interrupt you here. Hope we don't have to stay here for too long,\" a Xiaohongshu user using the name Ryan Martin said in a video posted yesterday seemingly addressing the app’s Chinese user base. He translated the statement into Chinese and used a robot voice generator to read it in the video, which has since been liked more than 24,000 times. “It’s fine, you are not interrupting. When you guys are active, we are sleeping,” reads one of the top comments in Chinese.\nThere are also dozens of live audio chatrooms on the platform where American and Chinese users explained to each other, probably for the first time in many cases, how their respective societies work and clarified common misunderstandings. One of the most popular chatrooms has been listened to by nearly 30,000 users.\nWhile Xiaohongshu is not specifically named in the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act that the Supreme Court is currently considering and could result in a US ban on TikTok, the law does stipulate that any “foreign adversary controlled application” may face a similar fate in the future. In other words, there’s no guarantee that Xiaohongshu won’t follow in TikTok’s footsteps in being blocked by the US government.\nThe TikTok ban might have catapulted Xiaohongshu to the center of attention in the US, but the app has been successful for a long time in China. Founded in 2013, the Shanghai-based company has operated one of the most, if not the most, trendy platforms in China over the past few years and reportedly generated over $1 billion in annual profits in 2024. To put it simply, it’s the hottest app in China that non-Chinese people have never heard of before.\nIt also has a sizable following among Chinese-speakers outside of the country, ranging from Chinese students overseas to Taiwanese people to diaspora communities in Malaysia. Restaurants, tourist hot spots, and travel companies around the world have started noticing the app because Chinese tourists heavily rely on it for local information and recommendations shared by fellow Chinese people.\nThe app is starkly different from TikTok in a few major ways. While Xiaohongshu does allow users to post short vertical videos just like TikTok, the majority of the content on the platform is photo slideshows coupled with text, which is why people often view it more as a competitor to Instagram than TikTok. The app’s AI-powered grid-shaped feed (referred to as a “masonry grid” in professional tech circles) has been so successful in driving engagement that larger social media companies like Tencent and ByteDance have copied the design in their own products. Lemon8, the other popular social media app developed by ByteDance aside from TikTok, is widely seen as an attempt to emulate Xiaohongshu and its success.\nIn fact, the app doesn’t even have a good English translation of its own name: Xiaohongshu is the just the phonetic translation of its Chinese name, 小红书. While the literal translation “little red book” may remind English-speaking users of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong’s collection of speeches and propaganda slogans by the same name, it has a different connotation in China, where users see the app as a source of reliable user-generated recommendations for mundane things, like which restaurant to go to or which cosmetic product to buy.\nThe recent influx of American users has certainly caught the attention of Xiaohongshu's existing user base. David Yang, a recent master’s program graduate from China currently living in Paris, suddenly found his Xiaohongshu feed full of American users on Sunday. He had previously seen some non-Chinese creators intentionally coming to the platform to attract Chinese followers, but nothing at this scale.\nNow, when he scrolls his Xiaohongshu home page, about one quarter of the content is from so-called TikTok refugees, according to a screen recording he shared. “Some of them are asking what Chinese people think of certain issues, like the USA, LGBT, or other social issues. And some are inviting Chinese users to ask them questions. And some are just using the app like they use TikTok and post anything they find interesting,” Yang tells WIRED. The concentration of genuine personal content shared by normal people rather than polished influencers was refreshing, he added.\nChinese Xiaohongshu users are fascinated by the influx of new voices. Most of them, especially those who speak English, are extending a welcoming hand, liking the videos posted by TikTok refugees and following their accounts. Some are taking the time to try to explain how the app works to people who find it hard to navigate due to the language barrier.\nSarah Fotheringham, a TikTok user since 2021 from Utah, tells WIRED she's having a surprisingly nice time on Xiaohongshu despite relying on Google Translate to use the platform. During her first two days on the app, she spent a few hours scrolling and posted four videos, the last one explaining how lunch works in US public schools to Chinese users. \"People have reached out to offer help in every way, from navigating the app, adding subtitles to videos, and translations,\" Fotheringham says. \"One comment on my video was from a Chinese user. She said, 'wow it's like looking over the Chinese wall.' And for me, it's been my first time seeing in.\"\n“Most of the [new Xiaohongshu users] are probably in the curiosity phase. I think moments of cultural shock or controversies could emerge as time goes on, but that would be part of the process for them to know each other on a deeper level,” Yang says.",

Learn more.\nMost computer standards change quickly, with manufacturers adopting new ports, cables, and form factors as soon as they release. Random-access memory (RAM), meanwhile, hasn’t changed all that much in the last decade. So what is the difference between the different types of modern RAM?\nSince its introduction in 2014, DDR4 has been the de facto standard for desktop computers, and DDR5 has taken over only in the last few processor generations. Along with a slightly updated form factor, DDR5 raises the total possible capacity and top speed of your memory, adds in some new functionality for overclockers, and reduces its overall power usage.\nCapacity and Form Factor\nThe first thing you’ll likely notice when shopping for DDR5 memory, at least for consumer options, are higher base capacities. While 16 GB DDR4 kits are commonplace, most DDR5 kits start at 32 GB, typically in a 2 x 16 GB setup. We already recommended 32 GB for new systems, so this is a welcome change to the baseline that should result in fewer unhappy users.\nDDR4 and DDR5 are not compatible with each other, despite how similar they look. Memory manufacturers will still stock both varieties for a bit, and they have similar product names, so always double-check you’ve got the right type for your motherboard. All AMD AM5 motherboards use DDR5, while Intel’s 12th generation supports both.\nThe two are physically almost identical, and the only visual indicator on most sticks of RAM will be the notch in the pins at the bottom. On DDR5 this notch will be directly in the center, while it’s slightly offset on DDR4. The shifted notch should prevent you from installing the wrong type of memory when building a new computer, but only if you line it up first and see that it doesn’t fit.\nFaster Speeds\nWhile the sticks may look the same, there are way more horses under the hood. The standard for DDR4 chips technically maxed out at 3,200 MHz, which is the new starting point for DDR5. We’ve only seen a few examples of the top end, but DDR5 supports speeds all the way up to teetering on 8,000 MHz. Don’t expect to put memory like that in your gaming rig any time soon though; most consumer DDR5 RAM tops out around 6,400 MHz.\nOverclocking has improved as well, with Intel updating XMP (eXtreme Memory Profile) to 3.0 for DDR5. Where XMP 2.0 supported just two profiles, the newest version boasts five. Three are set by the memory manufacturer, with two more for you to tweak and edit your own settings. Intel hosts spreadsheets with settings from common manufacturers if you’re curious what those profiles look like.\nYou may have noticed that, despite overall higher clock speeds, the latency on DDR5 memory is a bit slower than DDR4. That doesn’t tell the whole story though, and as memory manufacturer Corsair explains, “DDR4 usually has a CAS latency of 16, while DDR5 will have a CAS latency of at least 32. However, because of its faster clock speeds, the newer standard has better performance overall.” In other words, it takes more cycles to complete a task, but those cycles are much faster than before.\nThe Real Nerdy Stuff\nThere are a few other changes to the standard for DDR5 that don’t really impact which sticks you slot in your particular PC.\nDDR5 memory should use less power overall than DDR4, although not in a way that will let you get away with a smaller power supply. Instead, it gives manufacturers and overclockers more voltage headroom to push for even higher speeds. Each stick of DDR5 memory has its own power management chip now too, rather than the motherboard handling power distribution. Again, probably not something that will matter to most people, but it should result in a more consistent experience when using XMP profiles.\nYou also get increased bandwidth thanks to a big change to the basic architecture of a memory DIMM. Where each DDR4 module relied on a single 64-bit channel, DDR5 has two 32-bit channels. When combined with the increased speed and efficiency, memory manufacturer Crucial says “users can get up to 2X the system bandwidth compared to DDR4 for next-gen, multi-core CPUs.”\nSome manufacturers also mention Error Correction Code, or ECC, which is now present on DDR5 memory. This is a little bit different from the ECC on DDR4, which was an extra module present on chips intended for server or commercial use. Instead of helping a bunch of different memory chips communicate reliably, it corrects errors on the individual banks before sending it off to the motherboard. Commercial memory maker ATP has an in-depth explainer on the reasoning for this tech that goes beyond the scope of what’s needed for your gaming computer, if that’s of interest.\nToo Much to Remember?\nIf you’re building a new PC, it’s extremely likely your motherboard will support DDR5, so that’s what you should buy. The only reason you'd need DDR4 memory for a new build is if you're specifically using old parts to keep costs down. It's more likely you'd be hunting for DDR4 because you're upgrading an existing system.\nIn the early days of the launch, you might’ve paid almost twice as much for DDR5 over DDR4, but prices have settled with more widespread adoption, and they’ll look recognizable to anyone who bought memory before the update.",

    "content_text": "In the wake of the Los Angeles wildfires, many people—including city officials—described the aftermath as being like a bomb had detonated. Not only have buildings been destroyed, but underground, melted plastic and a slurry of ash and debris threaten to end up in the maze of pipes that transport fresh drinking water, contaminating the municipal water supply.\nResidents in affected areas have been placed under unsafe water advisories, being instructed not to drink the tap water until further notice. How long drinking water will remain unsafe for residents is still unclear, says Faith Kearns, scientist and director of research communications with the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative at Arizona State University. Drinking contaminated water in fire-affected areas could lead to waterborne illness, like the intestinal infection Giardia, or result in long-term health consequences from exposure to cancer-causing chemicals.\nInitially, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) issued a “boil water” advisory on Wednesday January 8 that allowed residents in fire-affected and fire-adjacent areas to drink water after boiling it. By Friday, however, it was upgraded to a “Do Not Drink” alert. While boiling water kills viruses and bacteria, it will not protect against common chemical contaminants often introduced during wildfires, says Daniel McCurry, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Southern California.\nAccording to the City of Pasadena, where the Eaton Fire is burning, you should not try to treat the water yourself. “Boiling, freezing, filtering, adding chlorine or other disinfectants, or letting water stand will not make the water safe to drink,” reads the alert. The advisory also warns residents not only to avoid drinking the water, but to limit hot water activities such as bathing, dishwashing, and laundry, which can release chemicals into the air.\n“If your region is under a Do Not Drink advisory, it’s probably because some part of the water distribution system has burned,” says McCurry. Burned components can introduce volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other harmful chemicals into the water supply. The severity of these issues will depend on how much physical damage the water infrastructure has endured. “These fires aren’t even out yet, so it’s a very dynamic situation,” Kearns says.\nVulnerable parts of the water system include the plastic components in water meters, pipes, gaskets, and storage tanks. This plastic is largely made up of polyvinyl chloride—PVC—and contains VOCs that are known to cause cancer if released. The most well-known is benzene, but dozens of equally harmful chemicals could enter the system depending on the material that’s breaking down. Once the plastic melts, these chemicals leach directly into the water and evaporate into the air.\nAlthough experts haven’t confirmed VOC contamination in Los Angeles yet, because it’s too early for workers to perform testing in burned areas, past fires—like the Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, California and the Lahaina Fire in Maui, Hawaii—suggest that it’s highly likely. “In recent years, we’ve seen that fires are burning so hot that they will melt plastic piping,” says Kearns. “With structure destruction and depressurization, the water utilities likely have contamination,” adds Andrew Whelton, associate professor of civil, environmental, and ecological engineering at Purdue University, who frequently consults with municipalities across the country about wildfire water response.\nDepressurization, the other big contributor to contamination, occurs when firefighting efforts draw massive amounts of water from the system in a short period. “A water line that connects to a house can generally put out about 9 gallons per minute,” says Whelton.“Firefighters can draw 500 gallons or up to 1,500 gallons of water per minute. So if you were to run five or six pumper trucks off of a water line, you’re looking at thousands of gallons of water being extracted from the water system in a very short period.”\nWhen that happens, water pressure plummets, and the system becomes vulnerable to bacteria or chemicals entering the system from the surrounding environment. Usually, the high pressure of the water inside the system prevents any outside contaminants—such as soil or groundwater—from being able to find their way inside the system’s components.\nStructural damage from fires can also result in pressure losses, says Whelton. In the case of large-scale fires like the Palisades or Eaton fires, you can have huge volumes of water dumping, uncontrolled, out of the system, due to pipes and other parts of the system being ruptured. Where there is damage, smoke and debris can be sucked into the water system, while damaged sewage lines can leak into the drinking water pipes that run nearby. “When the water system utility starts to try to repressurize, they start pushing that contaminated water through the infrastructure again,” says Whelton.\nDuring the Marshall Fire in Louisville, Colorado in 2021, which burned over 1,000 homes, city officials advised residents to use mains water only for flushing until extensive testing confirmed safety. Given that over 12,000 structures have burned in Los Angeles as of Monday morning, the potential of widespread contamination is significant, Kearns warns.\nThe coming days and weeks will be crucial. Once water experts assess the damage, they will determine whether the system can be flushed clean or if infrastructure repairs are necessary. If enough has burned, workers will need to replace pumps, pipes, and even tanks. For parts of Los Angeles County served by LADWP, McCurry estimates this recovery could take anywhere from a few days to weeks.\nAltadena and the surrounding regions, however, are serviced by multiple smaller water providers, like the Lincoln Avenue Water Company, Las Flores Water Company, Rubio Canon Land and Water Association, and Kinneloa Irrigation District—all of which have issued Do Not Drink notices. “In the case of a large water system like LADWP, you’ll probably see things resume a little bit faster,” says Kearns. “For smaller water providers, which can sometimes have just a couple of employees and not have the budgets for these kinds of events, they may have some struggles.” Santa Cruz experienced similar challenges during the CZU Lightning Complex Fire in 2020, with the water service taking months to stabilize. McCurry warns that some regions may require years to build from scratch or overhaul large systems that have burned.\nIt’s vital for residents to stay informed about recovery efforts, because alert systems can be complicated, and many residents may not even receive them, says Kearns. People should “proactively seek out any boil or Do Not Drink water alerts from your water provider, your city, your county,” she advises. “Share those with your neighbors and make sure any folks who might have languages other than English as a first language get those alerts and understand what’s happening.”\nSome places, like Louisville in Colorado, and Maui in Hawaii, released public access maps that tracked water quality at each land plot, which helped to keep residents informed during the months and years that followed.\nBefore lifting advisories, water providers are legally required by the State of California to monitor for benzene. However, Whelton cautions that benzene isn’t the only chemical of concern and the list of potential contaminants is long. Both government and third-party testing services do not always account for every possible exposure. “It’s possible that some of those chemicals could linger for longer than water providers expect,” echoes McCurry. He still recommends staying vigilant. Activated charcoal filters can help remove some organic contaminants, but they may not fully eliminate risks.\n“Safe water can be restored after a fire,” says Whelton. “The communities that recover rapidly and stronger are those who work together and support one another.”",

    "content_text": "The Biden administration announced a bold and controversial new export control scheme today, designed to prevent the advanced chips and artificial intelligence models themselves from ending up in the hands of adversaries such as China.\nThe administration’s new “AI Diffusion rule” divides the world into nations that are allowed relatively unfettered access to America’s most advanced AI silicon and algorithms, and those that will require special licenses to access the technology. The rule, which will be enforced by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, also seeks to restrict the movement of the most powerful AI models for the first time.\n“The US leads the world in AI now, both AI development and AI chip design, and it's critical that we keep it that way,” the US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said ahead of today’s announcement.\nThe list of trusted nations are the UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, France, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Taiwan.\nCompanies in other nations not subject to arms controls will be able to obtain up to 1,700 of the latest AI chips without special permission, the rule states. They will be able to apply for a special license to acquire more chips, to build very large scale data centers using US technology, or to gain access to the most powerful closed model “weights” made by US firms. Companies will be required to have adequate physical and cybersecurity to obtain a license.\nSupply chain activities, including the design, manufacturing, and storage of chips, will be exempt from the rule. The rule also will not restrict open source AI models such as Meta’s Llama, the administration says.\nArms-embargoed nations such as China, Iran, and North Korea are already forbidden from obtaining advanced chips. The new rule will for the first time restrict their access to advanced models.\n“The semiconductors that power [AI] and the model weights are, as we all know, a dual use technology,” Raimondo added ahead of the announcement. “They're used in many commercial applications but also can be used by our adversaries to run nuclear simulations, develop bio weapons, and advance their militaries.”\nThe rule is sure to stoke controversy, however, because it may throttle international sales of AI at a critical moment for the industry. It comes just a week before Donald Trump’s inauguration. The ruling sets a 120-day consultation period, meaning Trump‘s administration will be expected to listen to input, perhaps modify the rule, and then enforce it.\nNvidia, the world’s leading manufacturer of AI chips, called the rule “unprecedented and misguided” in a blog post. “While cloaked in the guise of an ‘anti-China’ measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance US security. Rather than mitigate any threat, the new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the US ahead.”\nThe US already limits exports of advanced AI chips to China, a key geopolitical rival, but companies there have been able to build cutting algorithms using computer clusters located in other nations. Under the new rule, China will not be able to build so-called frontier AI models in other nations impacted by the rule.\nThe rule is the latest in an escalating series of export controls aimed at preventing China from harnessing cutting-edge AI. The technology is expected to become increasingly crucial for military, intelligence, and industrial applications that could define geopolitical power in the decades to come. The Biden administration introduced new restrictions on the export of chip-manufacturing equipment, certain types of computer memory, and chip design software to China in December in its latest effort to weaken that country’s ability to mint advanced chips.\nBiden officials say that they found this rule necessary because AI may advance swiftly and unpredictably in the years to come. “The US has to be prepared for rapid increases in AI capabilities in the coming years, which could have transformative impacts on the economy and on our national security,” said Jake Sullivan, the Biden administration’s national security adviser.\nThe Biden administration also felt justified in setting the rules in its last days because of how rapidly Chinese AI is advancing, according to a senior administration official who asked not to be named. The administration believes China’s AI development is between six and 18 months behind that of the US. “Time is really of the essence,” the official said of the rule. “We believe we're in a critical window right now.”",

    "content_text": "On a frigid day in Copenhagen when Erik Hageman was 2 years old, he tripped over his wooden clogs. His face smashed into the floor. In the emergency room, a surgeon repaired his tongue, which had split, but in the months while he was recuperating he shrieked nonstop for water. His urine turned sticky and sweet. The doctor diagnosed diabetes, type 1, the autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own pancreas.\nThis was 1942. The Nazis occupied Denmark and eugenics was their first medical principle. Trauma like Erik’s fall, some suggested, activated diabetes, and the bloodline of the diabetic was poisoned. Three short weeks of neglect, the doctor promised Hageman’s parents, and their little son would perish of ketoacidosis or starvation. “The best you can do is do nothing,” the doctor said.\nStill, Hageman’s parents felt—and this was rebellious, given the master-race ideology that crackled through the Nazi Weltanschauung—that their boy deserved to live. When Hageman’s father, a custodian at a sports college, told his coworkers his son had diabetes, one of them knew a guy.\nHans Christian Hagedorn, short-tempered physician. Wild tufts of hair. At Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium just outside of Copenhagen, he was refining insulin from the pancreases of cows and pigs to make it work better for humans. During a long period under Hagedorn’s care, Erik Hageman started to get twice-daily injections of a fine precipitate of protamine insulin, a breakthrough formulation that prolonged insulin’s effects in the body. Neutral Protamine Hagedorn is still on the World Health Organization’s list of essential medicines. By the time he was 5, Hageman was injecting himself with a wide-gauge needle as broad as—he pantomimed to me, in a kind of diabetic fish story—a tree trunk.\nAt 85, Erik Hageman is a dapper grandfather of surpassing warmth, compact like a tap dancer. He’s one of the longest-living diabetics in Denmark. We spent an afternoon together in a modernist mansion in Copenhagen called Domus Hagedorn, which is owned by Novo Nordisk, the Danish firm that grew from Hagedorn’s lab. “Hagedorn was rather crazy,” Hageman told me. But without the doctor’s care, he explained, “I’d be blind and I’d have to cut off my legs and have kidney failure.” The now-global company makes half the insulin in the world. Yet today it’s rich and famous for producing Ozempic, the megahit semaglutide drug.\nJust before visiting Erik Hageman, I met Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, who has presided over the company’s epochal metamorphosis, at the company’s headquarters in Bagsværd, a suburb of Copenhagen. The building’s design, with its giant helix-like indoor spiral staircase, is inspired by insulin—the molecule, the miracle. In a conference room flooded with light, Jørgensen spoke fondly of Hageman, the company’s poster child. Novo’s executives had clearly presented Hageman to convince me that the company’s greatest achievement is not its stratospheric valuation but its century-long record of saving lives with insulin.\nBut at Novo these days, semaglutide blocks out the sun. Ozempic was the world’s second-highest-selling drug in 2024. It works extremely well for type 2 diabetes, a non-autoimmune disorder in which the body makes poor use of insulin. And one effect of semaglutide, as we all know now, has been the box-office draw from day one: appetite suppression. The drugs that contain it—especially Ozempic and its more powerful sister Wegovy—have transformed Novo into a global slimming juggernaut. In 2023, the company surpassed Parisian luxury brand LVMH to become the richest company in all of Europe, hitting the ludicrously high market cap of $424 billion. In 2024, Novo took a punch in the face, but it ended the year still richer by market cap than Bank of America, Coca-Cola, and Toyota.\nBeyond the dazzling before-and-afters, though, Jørgensen is looking at a tricky future, parts of which, he told me, “scare the hell” out of him.\nThough Novo has as its controlling shareholder the largest altruistic foundation in the world, it has to act coldly and tactically, like an oil or defense company. The demanding semaglutide business has become a mean ouroboros: the insatiable market, exorbitant manufacturing costs, competition from Eli Lilly, pricing pressure from governments, and the private-insurance dystopia in the US—by far Novo’s biggest market, where some 15 million people now take semaglutide. At the same time is the moral crux. Semaglutide alone almost never works for the 8.4 million type 1 diabetics around the world. What keeps Jørgensen up at night is his fear that, the way drug manufacturing and American health care companies and global markets work, his company might not be able to do right by its original patients. These are the non-Hollywood patients—the ones who, like Eric Hageman, can’t live without insulin.\nFor its first 75 years, Novo was indispensable but unknown, a producer of insulin, an anonymous commodity. In 1991 the obscurity started to lift. That year, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, a Danish chemical engineer, was seeking a treatment specifically for type 2 diabetes, which accounts for as much as 95 percent of all cases of the disease. Over the next 18 years, she led a Novo team in developing an exquisitely cool medicine for type 2 called liraglutide. Liraglutide is an analogue of a human hormone called GLP-1, for glucagon-like peptide-1. After humans eat, we very, very briefly secrete GLP-1 in the brain stem and the gut.\nGLP-1 can be seen as a tranquilizer for the flesh, a soother of deep and primitive longings. GLP-1 says to the body: peace. Food is available. But GLP-1 in its natural form only murmurs these soothing blandishments for a minute or two. It affords the hungry soul a glimpse of OK-ness, but a fleeting one.\nThe challenge for Knudsen was to build a dupe of GLP-1 that would persist, a GLP-1 that would let a patient feel blood-sugar equanimity longer. Knudsen pulled this off by snapping a fatty acid onto a precise spot on a chain of amino acids. It’s incomprehensibly more complex than that, but eureka anyway: Knudsen had something that acted like our natural GLP-1 hormone but stayed in the system for a full day.\nLiraglutide was approved in the US for type 2 diabetes in 2010 and for weight loss in 2014. But a daily injection could put patients off. So Novo assembled a new team of researchers that included Jesper Lau, a peptide and protein engineer, who invented semaglutide, from the French semaine, for “week.” Semaglutide suffuses the body and brain for seven days.\nA weeklong reprieve from blood sugar turbulence, and from the ravenousness that defines modern existence. A single shot and you feel like you’ve just eaten always. In 2018, the world learned Novo Nordisk’s name when the company released semaglutide as Ozempic. Novo even created a jingle. Oh oh oh Ozempic!\nThe cheers for semaglutide would have drowned out the cheers for insulin a hundred years ago. Yes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea—these are not uncommon side effects. And some rare but terrifying ones like possible blindness have been identified. But semaglutide is generally, as they say, “well tolerated.” True believers see a panacea: a treatment for alcoholism, heart disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, sleep apnea, liver disease, and a newly identified mental obsession with eating and dieting known as “food noise,” which is especially common in the US.\nMost Danes have never even heard the Ozempic jingle. Like nearly every country on earth except the United States and New Zealand, Denmark prohibits advertising prescription pharmaceuticals to consumers. With its weight-loss fetish and direct-to-consumer marketing, the US was clearly Novo’s Troy, primed to be sacked. Under CEO Jørgensen, Novo hired media giant Wavemaker, whose clients include L’Oréal and Tiffany. Novo began spending reportedly close to $200 million a year flogging semaglutide. Americans were soon hooked on the jingle, the relief, and the compliments.\nTo make money stateside means navigating through the dark woods of both America’s health care quagmire and its thorny diet culture. One of the biggest tasks for Novo was to throw off the impression that semaglutide is a vanity drug. Styling it like insulin, a sober injection for a disease, rather than like speed, a candy-colored pill for weight loss, was the only way to get it covered by fickle American insurance companies. And if semaglutide could be covered, especially while under patent, it would be exponentially more bankable.\nThus, Novo Nordisk joined the ongoing effort to fire-hose the world with the word obesity, not to refer to body size but to a metabolic disease. By the time Wegovy—specifically for weight loss, with a dosage of semaglutide 2.4 times higher than the Ozempic dosage at the time—was approved in 2021, obesity was in full swing as its own affliction, and semaglutide swooped in as the cure.\nNot long after, the FDA handed Novo yet another victory when it approved Wegovy to “reduce the risk of serious heart problems” in heavier-weight people. The agency added that 70 percent of American adults fall into this category.\nin spite of the market ruckus about semaglutide, insulin still seemed like the favorite child at Novo’s headquarters. Engineered human insulin is a pharmaceutical jewel, a priceless DNA sequence rigged up in 1978 and sometimes described as biotech’s first “golden molecule.” It’s also a so-called biologic. Biologics are medicines derived from big, complex, living molecules: bacteria, blood, yeast, viruses, and animal and plant matter. They are costly and complex to create.\nInsulin at Novo is made from baker’s yeast, a microorganism with a relatively high biomass that’s chock full of protein, essential amino acids, and minerals. It’s an ideal workshop for a DNA tinkerer. At the same time, built molecules, the ones like insulin that express themselves in yeast, are maddeningly idiosyncratic.\nMonika Nøhr Løvgreen, a research scientist I spoke to in her lab at Novo, told me her love affair with engineered molecules can get tumultuous. “It’s not enough for a molecule to give me the biology I need. I need something I can inject without getting red or itchy, that doesn’t degrade when I store it, that’s well behaved in the solution.” Løvgreen described some molecules as “prima donnas” while others are well behaved, elegant, and even queenly.\nIn the insulin and semaglutide labs, engineering a molecule correctly is everything, Brian Vandahl, Novo’s head of global research technology, told me. That’s where scientists create “the single cell that starts the whole release culture, that lives in those big tanks.” From Bagsværd, he gestured vaguely in the direction of the company’s giant drug-manufacturing facilities.\nWhether for insulin or other biologics, it’s not cheap to grow, ferment, and purify living cells. (Though it is made in a similar way as insulin, the engineered protein in semaglutide contains fewer than 40 amino acids, so the FDA classifies it as a small-molecule drug, rather than a biologic.) Like pets or people or gardens, microorganisms need to be lovingly cared for, which requires patience, sugar, climate control, and constant cleaning with substances that don’t kill microorganisms. In West Lebanon, New Hampshire, where Novo has a secretive biologics facility, one local referred to the plant as “the place where they teach fleas to sing and dance.”\nBy contrast, blockbuster tablets like Prozac, Viagra, Oxycontin, Tylenol, Lipitor are, relatively, a piece of cake—and cheaper to make. They’re usually derived from nonliving molecules with lower biomass, mostly chemical compounds. Hardy and inanimate, these chemicals don’t need to be managed with kid gloves. “It’s easier to control chemistry,” Vandahl said. “But I’m more fascinated by biology.”\nNow that Novo is responsible for the blockbuster semaglutide drugs and half the world’s insulin, it is putting tens of billions of dollars into expanding its production facilities. Each one costs $2 or $3 billion and takes five years to bring online—half of the time to build, the other half testing the machinery.\nLast year the company broke ground on a vast new manufacturing facility in the seaport town of Kalundborg, Denmark, on the island of Zealand. This biotech metropolis produces a range of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, from living cells, including insulin and semaglutide. “Look for Dubai,” one Novo employee told me, when describing how to spot the place.\nThe town is indeed a misty forest of harbor cranes and construction dust. I wanted most of all to see the vats of high-spirited yeast. Michael Hallgren, the senior vice president of API manufacturing, gave me a tour. After we gowned up, he let me hold a small vial with molasses-colored fluid; this was the showpiece cell engineered in the lab. They wouldn’t tell me if it contained the molecule for insulin or semaglutide. But the rich appearance of the fluid, the intense specialness—I recognized it. “A sourdough starter?” I asked after a beat.\n“Yes,” he said. Strolling through the factories, which Hallgren, at nearly 7 feet, seemed to cross in a single bound, what I noticed most was silo-sized mixing bowls. Inside them, something that looked like cake batter bubbled. It was comforting how strongly the facilities smelled like bread, like beer—alive and fizzy. “And, when that starter grows,” Hallgren told me, “It’s enough to treat 500,000 diabetics for one year.”\nNovo Nordisk employs around 30,000 people in Denmark, with about 5,000 in Kalundborg alone. One bright-eyed young employee, who traveled from the Philippines to Kalundborg to work at the company, has a job validating machinery. (“I have an aunt who has diabetes and uses our product,” she told me.) With some $8.5 billion invested in expanding the plant here, hundreds more are expected to come. Not long after I left Denmark, Novo announced it was building yet another facility—in Odense, for $1.2 billion. A Copenhagen politician even said that he anticipates an American brain drain of scientists to Denmark during Trump’s second term.\nNovo also has plants devoted to making its drugs in Brazil, China, France, Algeria, Iran, and the US. In December, it acquired Catalent, a global development and manufacturing company headquartered in New Jersey, for $11.7 billion.\nBut Novo’s impact on Denmark is absolute. The country is home to fewer than 6 million people, and somehow the company’s recent triumphs have driven its GDP up ahead of Egypt, which has a population of 112.7 million. The company pays in taxes what any self-respecting American capitalist would consider confiscatory: $3.6 billion globally in income taxes in 2023, $2.3 billion of that to Denmark. Corporate tax revenue in Kalundborg has shot up 10-fold since 2010. “Big shoutout to overweight Americans for keeping my mortgage low,” a Danish economist tweeted in 2023.\nsince word of semaglutide’s slimming effects hit the diet-culture rialto, people have been clamoring for it. In 2022, the FDA listed semaglutide drugs as in shortage. People who couldn’t wait for the real thing began to turn to specialized pharmacies that cook up Ozempic knock-offs as if it were bathtub gin, sometimes with tragic results.\nMeanwhile, just as Novo was making the market, Indiana-based Eli Lilly rolled out its own GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. With an American company invading Novo’s market, some warned that Denmark now faced the so-called “Nokia risk”—the fate that befell Finland in the aughts when it predicated its entire economy on Nokia and its pioneering smartphone, only to get wiped out when Apple introduced the iPhone.\nThe US government too has absorbed the size of the GLP-1 phenomenon. At the end of 2024, the Biden administration proposed a rule that would have Medicare and Medicaid cover semaglutide for weight loss. “It’s a game changer for Americans who can’t afford these drugs otherwise,” Xavier Becerra, the head of Health and Human Services, said.\nSure, the new administration will likely kibosh this. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump has nominated to run health policy, has waffled on Ozempic, once claiming that obesity and even diabetes can be cured with discipline and diet. (Novo Nordisk, he told Fox News, is “counting on selling it to Americans because we are so stupid and so addicted to drugs.”) But Americans are unlikely to go without. At Christmas, Elon Musk, looking gaunt, styled himself as “Ozempic Santa.”\nnothing matters more to Novo than doing brisk and brisker business in the US. This requires that the company do regular battle with the same demon even the lowliest American confronts: health care runarounds.\nOn September 29, 2024, Senator Bernie Sanders grilled Lars Jørgensen at a hearing on the price of Ozempic and Wegovy. Bernie found the price of patent-protected semaglutide too damn high, and he seemed to be champing at the bit for a set piece in which he’d slay his very own Big Tobacco CEO. Comparing Ozempic’s price in Germany ($59) to its US price (some $600 after rebates), Sanders asked Jørgensen, “From a moral perspective, does it bother you that keeping the price of Ozempic and Wegovy so high could lead to the preventable deaths of tens of thousands of Americans?”\nJørgensen seemed to hedge. Novo now pays a reported $5 million a year to lobbyists to get lawmakers on its side; still he had volunteered to testify. He wanted, he told me, to educate the lawmakers. In a calm and steely voice, he explained how costly it is to make biologics. He didn’t give Sanders the fireworks the senator craved. Instead, he directed the committee’s attention to pharmacy benefit managers.\nPBMs. The worst. They’re the despised outfits like CVS Caremark that administer drugs for health plans, negotiate for insurance companies, and, most notably, maintain the lists of drugs covered by insurance.\nThough many of us learned about PBMs only after the December assassination of Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, which is affiliated with a giant PBM, Jørgensen has called these middlemen the real enemy for a long time. Facing down Sanders, he spelled out one of the most excruciating paradoxes of American health care. PBMs make their money from insurance premiums, but they also get money from drugmakers in the form of rebates. Usually, the more expensive a medication is, the higher its rebate. If a drug company like Novo drops the price of its drugs too low, the PBMs, afraid to miss their cut, often stop covering them altogether.\nTake Levemir. As Novo Nordisk rode $18.5 billion high on semaglutide profits, the company announced it would discontinue one of its insulin products. Levemir was set to vanish entirely from US pharmacies on December 31, 2024. Patients were stunned. Though Levemir had lost its luster as a first-line treatment, thousands of patients in the US still used it. The long-acting insulin drug, which metabolizes more quickly than other types of insulin, works especially well for young, pregnant, or highly active type 1 diabetics. Novo aimed to soothe anxiety by pointing out that it offers a range of other products for these patients.\nJørgensen told the committee, “We lowered the list price in the US by 65 percent, just to realize that after we dropped the price of Levemir, the PBMs dropped coverage.” Novo discontinued the drug. Of course, the company bears some responsibility for the price of its biologics. But as Senator Tim Kaine pointed out at the hearing, Novo and PBMs are apples and oranges. Novo “makes life-saving treatments,” he said, while PBMs essentially exist to skim.\nNovo Nordisk, with its Danish earnestness, really seems to believe it could confound the paradigm of capitalist rapacity. While it is publicly owned and traded, its controlling shareholder is still the Novo Nordisk Foundation, cofounded by Hans Christian Hagedorn in the 1920s to use profits from insulin sales to research diabetes. Its mandate has expanded, and it has spent billions to address societal and climate crises. Most recently, the foundation, which is more than twice the size of the Gates Foundation, allocated $1.3 billion of its $167 billion endowment to research and humanitarian grants.\nAt the hearing, Sanders, the old lefty, stopped his hammering of Jørgensen to praise Danish decency. “As you may know, look, I’m a great respecter of the people of Denmark. I think you have a social system which is very progressive.” About Novo specifically, he said, “All we are saying, Mr. Jørgensen, is: Treat the American people the same way you treat people all over the world.”\nThe market, as usual, had a mind of its own. It focus was not on diabetes: Emily Field, a pharma analyst at Barclays, predicted that weight-loss drugs like Wegovy would be “the biggest pharmaceutical class ever” and worth $200 billion in a decade. She added that insulin is of “decreasing financial importance” to Novo Nordisk.\nThis may have been exciting to investors, but it wasn’t what any diabetes patient wanted to hear. Already Novo was under so much pressure to manufacture pens for obesity and type-2 diabetes patients that it had scaled back making insulin pens in South Africa. Without those pens, type 1 diabetics had to resort to cumbersome vials. (A spokesperson at the time said Novo was phasing out certain products to address “capacity constraints.”)\n“This is completely unacceptable,” Helen Bygrave, of Doctors Without Borders, told me. “More lucrative medicines in the same pen devices—GLP-1s like Ozempic and Wegovy—are being sold by Novo at an unprecedented rate in high-income countries. This has clearly diverted manufacturing capacity of pens to garner billions in profits at the cost of people living with diabetes.”\nFaced with having to ramp up production, feed lobbying and marketing divisions, and meet its earning projections, Novo Nordisk—the foundation-run, conscience-stricken insulin company—seemed, from the outside, to be acting less like a research hospital and more like a corporation that had hit the heel of hockey-stick growth.\nit was an unexpectedly sunny day in mid November when I met Jørgensen at Novo headquarters. The CEO, Novo’s fifth in 100 years, is a tall, handsome man with a long stride and a soft voice. After a successful knee surgery last year, he’s back to kayaking, playing tennis, and riding his bike through the Danish countryside. The employees at Novo had warned me that Jørgensen is introverted, and I expected reticence from him or even evasion. This was wrong.\nI asked him straightaway about fat.\n“My own personal journey is one of being guilty of stigmatizing people with overweight, obesity,” Jørgensen said. “I was coming from an original thought of ‘OK, that’s probably because you eat too much, and you are not active enough.’”\nThat meme-weary phrase, personal journey—Jørgensen, to my surprise, seemed to mean it. “I went from ‘If you just did better, you would have changed your weight and you’ll be fine’ to understanding that people are different. There’s a genetic dimension, there’s where you live, your financial position, your socioeconomic position, the culture you live and work in. It’s a bit too simple to look at it as a self-inflicted condition.”\nHe went on. “People do not like to be stigmatized.” He seemed to grapple with Novo’s role in American diet culture. “But even saying it’s a disease is, in a way, stigmatizing people. I also understand that body-mass index is not a good way to diagnose people.”\nWhat was this? His phrasing sounded distantly familiar. But not like a CEO. He sounded almost like a social worker. Diabetics, of course, deserve such high-touch treatment. But perhaps the more annoying patients do too—the ones panicked about food and their body’s appearance and desperate to lose 25 pounds.\nWhen I brought up insulin, Jørgensen turned militant. “Insulin is still a very important market for us,” he said. “We are committed to the field. It’s not something that’s growing like type 2 diabetes or obesity, but this is where it all started. We’ll never walk away from people with type 1 diabetes. We owe that to them. We don’t see it as a burden.”\nWhat worries him is that competing companies are developing biosimilars for insulin that are cheaper to produce than the insulin at Novo. Ah, now we have some garden-variety greed, I thought.\nBut it’s more complex than that. The scenario Jørgensen sketched out for me presented a migraine of catch-22s. “I worry about the future of a market that’s becoming more commoditized,” he said. “If other companies make biosimilar insulins, and if countries shift to that product, we’d have to start using our capacity for other drugs.”\nHe continued: “If patients end up relying on them, and those companies don’t have the history and know-how to make a low-margin product, and we have moved our capacity elsewhere, there’s a shortage of insulin. Who ends up supplying patients, and what kind of commitment do they have?” He paused. Then he expressed another anxiety. I’d expected Jørgensen to strut like a man on top of the world. His troubles were troubling.\n“It worries me that policymakers don’t understand the market. We at Novo Nordisk don’t decide what patients pay. The reality is that, for us, the price of insulin—what we get—has gone down very rapidly. We have support programs for those who cannot afford our products or do not have insurance.” Novo’s Patient Assistance Program indeed gives away Ozempic and insulin to eligible Americans who earn anywhere up to four times the poverty line.\n“The only place where we give medicine away like this is the refugee camps, war zones, and the US,” Jørgensen said.\nHe then returned to his anger at health care companies. In the US, he says, for every dollar of revenue Novo gets from selling insulin, it gives 74 cents to PBMs, wholesalers, and insurance companies. Whenever PBMs and others hike prices to get their cut, Jørgensen told me, policymakers insist Novo should lower its costs. “If this persists, the economics around insulin could be no longer viable. That scares the hell out of me.”\nSo it’s not just that Jørgensen, as a CEO, fears competition from cheaper drugs. It’s that, at any moment, Novo Nordisk could become stretched so thin by market forces that it couldn’t serve all of its patients. Say, for instance, other pharma companies get a piece of the insulin market with their cheaper biosimilars, and Novo cedes some of the insulin business. Then the new entrants, lacking a long-standing duty to serve diabetics and fed up with the drug’s low margins, stop making it. By then Novo’s insulin capacity would be devoted to other medicine. There could be an insulin shortage. Diabetics could die.\nI thought of the type 1 diabetics I know and love, with their insulin pumps, pens, glucose monitors, and tracking apps. I thought of their moments of rocky blood sugar—the shakes, sweating, blurred vision, anxiety. Now I was scared. How could Novo ensure that it’s at least cost-effective to supply half of all the insulin for type 1 diabetics around the world?\n“Our history, our purpose, our values come into play,” Jørgensen said.\n“But of course, we also have shareholders … ” He trailed off. It seemed I’d never get an answer. Or maybe there just isn’t one.\nalmost as if to justify his fears, bad news hit Novo Nordisk at the very end of 2024. On December 4, Lilly released—and widely promoted—a study showing that people lose 20 percent of their body weight with Zepbound and a mere 14 percent with Wegovy. With this, the market contracted to a single data point: percentage of body mass shed. Forget metabolic disease. Like glossy magazines at the checkout counter, stock analysts were now fixated on dress sizes and beach bodies.\nThen, on December 20, Zepbound was approved to treat sleep apnea, the first GLP-1 to win this approval. The same week, Novo unveiled a study that—in an upside-down way—was deemed to be a grave disappointment. Patients who had taken Novo’s new CagriSema, a shot that combines semaglutide with an analog of another hormone, had slimmed down by 22.7 percent. That sounds like a boatload. And it was more than the Zepbounders lost. But Novo had projected the patients would shrink a full quarter in size—25 percent, not 22.7. Investors wailed, and the company’s share price shed a whopping 20 percent of its weight—that is, value.\nIn Denmark, on my last days there, I felt very serious. The cold Nordic air seemed clearer than the air at home in New York. As the sun set, I walked along the Copenhagen waterfront, looking out at the Øresund Strait. From the piers, beside a grove of ship masts, two elderly couples were skinny-dipping in cold seawater. They splashed and yelped and shivered and ran-hopped to seaside saunas. Their bodies were uninhibited and beautiful.\nWhen I told some American friends I had been at Novo Nordisk, several railed against semaglutide as a tool of patriarchal control by an evil pharma empire. I usually like this kind of fire, but Novo didn’t have evil-empire hallmarks. All those people who worked there, the researchers, the quality control staff, even executives, sincerely seemed to be trying, within the tight constraints of markets, to prevent disease, treat disease, save lives. That much seems fixed. It was the company’s prime directive.\nTo understand Jørgensen’s situation, I tried my hand at squaring Novo’s sacred duty with its fiduciary responsibilities. All the investment and research and care and feeding of yeast. All the jobs. The taxes. The madness of rampant food noise and the health care non-system in the US. And government pricing—at home and abroad. The lobbying and marketing. No luck.\nFor a biotech company overseen by a nonprofit to hit on the magic ingredient and to achieve, however briefly, world dominion and otherworldly profits, it was almost Faustian. I couldn’t shake the idea that Novo was at increasingly steep odds with itself, like a body devouring its own pancreas. And now Wall Street was “disappointed” that Novo’s latest drug didn’t induce weight loss more precipitous than 22 percent. Perhaps investors won’t wholeheartedly green-light Novo again until they see returns of 100 percent weight loss, the full deletion of human bodies.\nCorrection: 1/22/25, 1:30 PM EDT: This piece has been updated to correct the number of diabetics than can be treated with a vial of yeast, correct the Ozempic dosage in 2021, and clarify that Levemir was discontinued only within the United States.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\">Faced with having to ramp up production, feed lobbying and marketing divisions, and meet its earning projections, Novo Nordisk—the foundation-run, conscience-stricken insulin company—seemed, from the outside, to be acting less like a research hospital and more like a corporation that had hit the heel of hockey-stick growth.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><span class=\"lead-in-text-callout\">it was an</span> unexpectedly sunny day in mid November when I met Jørgensen at Novo headquarters. The CEO, Novo’s fifth in 100 years, is a tall, handsome man with a long stride and a soft voice. After a successful knee surgery last year, he’s back to kayaking, playing tennis, and riding his bike through the Danish countryside. The employees at Novo had warned me that Jørgensen is introverted, and I expected reticence from him or even evasion. This was wrong.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I asked him straightaway about fat.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“My own personal journey is one of being guilty of stigmatizing people with overweight, obesity,” Jørgensen said. “I was coming from an original thought of ‘OK, that’s probably because you eat too much, and you are not active enough.’”</p><p class=\"paywall\">That meme-weary phrase, <em>personal journey</em>—Jørgensen, to my surprise, seemed to mean it. “I went from ‘If you just did better, you would have changed your weight and you’ll be fine’ to understanding that people are different. There’s a genetic dimension, there’s where you live, your financial position, your socioeconomic position, the culture you live and work in. It’s a bit too simple to look at it as a self-inflicted condition.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">He went on. “People do not like to be stigmatized.” He seemed to grapple with Novo’s role in American diet culture. “But even saying it’s a disease is, in a way, stigmatizing people. I also understand that body-mass index is not a good way to diagnose people.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">What was <em>this</em>? His phrasing sounded distantly familiar. But not like a CEO. He sounded almost like a social worker. Diabetics, of course, deserve such high-touch treatment. But perhaps the more annoying patients do too—the ones panicked about food and their body’s appearance and desperate to lose 25 pounds.</p><p class=\"paywall\">When I brought up insulin, Jørgensen turned militant. “Insulin is still a very important market for us,” he said. “We are committed to the field. It’s not something that’s growing like type 2 diabetes or obesity, but this is where it all started. We’ll never walk away from people with type 1 diabetes. We owe that to them. We don’t see it as a burden.”</p><div class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe cAjMFL callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, Novo Nordisk’s CEO, at the company’s headquarters in Bagsværd, Denmark.</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Steven Achiam</span></div></figure></div><p class=\"paywall\">What worries him is that competing companies are developing biosimilars for insulin that are cheaper to produce than the insulin at Novo. <em>Ah, now we have some garden-variety greed</em>, I thought.</p><p class=\"paywall\">But it’s more complex than that. The scenario Jørgensen sketched out for me presented a migraine of catch-22s. “I worry about the future of a market that’s becoming more commoditized,” he said. “If other companies make biosimilar insulins, and if countries shift to that product, we’d have to start using our capacity for other drugs.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">He continued: “If patients end up relying on them, and those companies don’t have the history and know-how to make a low-margin product, and we have moved our capacity elsewhere, there’s a shortage of insulin. Who ends up supplying patients, and what kind of commitment do they have?” He paused. Then he expressed another anxiety. I’d expected Jørgensen to strut like a man on top of the world. His troubles were troubling.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Aaron Colvin was doing tricep pushdowns at the gym when he spotted a cartoonishly huge bodybuilder across the mirrored room. The guy was coaching a woman through a set of cable rows, and the 18-year-old Colvin paused to study their technique. When the bodybuilder caught him staring and lumbered over, Colvin got concerned. He figured he was about to be accused of ogling the man’s girlfriend—one of gym culture’s cardinal sins.\nBut the bodybuilder only wanted to strike up a friendly conversation, during which he asked Colvin what he did for a living. At that point in August 2023, Colvin was about to begin his freshman year at Niagara University, a small Catholic school near his hometown of Niagara Falls, New York. But he was lukewarm on college; he wanted to devote himself to becoming an entrepreneur like Grant Cardone or Alex Hormozi, two of his personal heroes. At 13, Colvin had vowed to follow in their footsteps so he could ease the financial pressure on his mother, a special-education teacher who had raised him with little help. As an intensely driven teen, he’d launched a series of one-man ventures that never quite panned out: T-shirt seller, carpet cleaner, affiliate marketer, drop-shipper, Amazon arbitrageur. He was currently working daily shifts at both Chipotle and Pet Supplies Plus to save up $3,000 for a course on how to run a personal-training business.\nColvin’s brawny new acquaintance wanted to steer him toward a different opportunity: “What do you know about solar?” he asked. When he wasn’t competing on the amateur bodybuilding circuit, the man said, he worked for Freedom Pros, the door-to-door sales arm of Freedom Forever, one of the nation’s leading installers of solar-energy systems. The bodybuilder had just returned from a trip to Florida where he’d joined a “blitz”—solar-industry slang for a sales event in which packs of young men in crisp polos and khaki shorts descend on a city, crash in a cheap hotel or Airbnb, and spend weeks knocking on as many doors as possible. He boasted of having made “crazy money”—as much as $20,000 in a single month—by convincing just a handful of homeowners to cover their roofs with solar panels.\nColvin, a sinewy former high-school wrestler whose rounded silver eyeglasses give him a scholarly mien, was plenty intrigued. “I’m like, holy shit,” he recalls. “Like, yeah, awesome, I’ll look into it.”\nA few weeks later, Colvin had a FaceTime call with the bodybuilder’s manager at Freedom Pros, an energetic 21-year-old named Will. Though his college semester had just begun, Colvin told Will he was thinking of dropping out: As someone who’d been shaped by hardship—he and his mother once lived above a Niagara Falls pharmacy that was regularly burglarized by drug addicts—he was having a tough time relating to his classmates, most of whom hailed from cushier backgrounds than his own. “I was having a midlife crisis in my dorm room,” Colvin says. Will pressed him to join his door-to-door sales crew, which he’d dubbed Seal Team Six. The work was a breeze, he said—just a simple matter of making homeowners aware they could save thousands by installing solar panels and selling surplus electricity back to the grid. As long as Colvin conveyed that message while standing on strangers’ doorsteps, his sales commissions would dwarf his wages at Chipotle. “Behind every door is $5,000” was the unofficial motto of Seal Team Six. (Freedom Forever claims its 2023 gross revenue topped $1 billion.)\nAfter a bit of mulling, Colvin declined the offer. He worried he’d regret quitting school without giving it a fair shake. But Will was a relentless recruiter. On a near-daily basis that fall and winter, he peppered Colvin with Instagram Reels produced by “solar bros” showing off their six-figure commission checks, their penthouse apartments, their exotic cars. These influencers—tanned, sculpted, brimming with confidence—stressed that anyone could reap such rewards if they had the courage to swap their mundane lives for a place in the green economy’s forward trenches.\nAs he slogged through accounting classes, Colvin became increasingly receptive to Will’s spiel. Midway through his second semester, he agreed to fly to Orlando for spring break to try out a blitz. If all went well, he’d even try to capture the flowering of his new career on video, in hopes of maybe becoming a solar bro himself.\nNo one buys solar systems to address an urgent need. They are what marketers refer to as “proactive products”—items you can live without but which may provide advantages down the line. In the industry’s early days, the systems were so pricey that they were marketed solely to wealthy homeowners who wanted to reduce their carbon footprint. But around 2010, the price of solar panels began to plummet as more manufacturing facilities came on line, particularly in China. At the same time, solar companies concocted leasing arrangements that helped limit up-front costs. Going solar could now be pitched to the masses as a decision with long-term financial benefits. But installation still ran upwards of $20,000, an investment that consumers were hesitant to make when their electrical situations seemed just fine.\nTo jolt them out of their complacency, the solar industry came to rely on one of the oldest—and most annoying—sales techniques: indiscriminately banging on doors. Companies such as Sunrun, which reported $2.25 billion in revenue in 2023, operate on the principle that there’s no good replacement for the intense persuasion that can be exerted in face-to-face conversations. And because commissions are much higher than those for typical door-to-door products, like magazine subscriptions or burglar alarms, there’s been no shortage of young recruits willing to heed the industry’s call for manpower.\nAs Colvin learned soon after landing in central Florida, the profession doesn’t coddle its newcomers. He was taken from the airport to the crew’s house in Kissimmee, a swampy city in the shadow of Disney World, to throw down his bags. Will then informed him there was no time for rest—the four-member crew was going to go “rip,” or knock on doors. They piled into Will’s Toyota Camry and drove 30 miles to the suburb of St. Cloud, where Colvin was briefed on the basics. He would be working as a “setter,” the person who makes the initial contact with homeowners and persuades them to book an appointment with the “closer,” the person who gets the contract signed. Colvin was instructed to use a script in which he told potential customers that he’d been dispatched to check on the neighborhood’s utility poles. (Exactly who had dispatched him remained vague.) He was then supposed to say the poles were about to be hardened against hurricanes, an expensive upgrade that would allegedly raise everyone’s electric bills by close to 40 percent. When a look of panic crossed a homeowner’s face, that was Colvin’s cue to tout solar panels as a money-saving solution.\nColvin rarely got that far. As Will periodically rode by on a Segway to monitor his work—Segways were for closers on Seal Team Six—Colvin flailed in his efforts to charm the residents of St. Cloud. Some people were outright hostile to his presence, perhaps because solar bros are widely stereotyped as dishonest. Their employers, including some of the biggest companies in the solar industry, have been sued hundreds of times for allegedly engaging in fraud. In May 2024, for example, the state of Nebraska sued Everlight Solar for using “misleading savings models that omit relevant information and accurate data that could result in projections that show consumers spending more on panels than they would save.” Homeowners familiar with solar’s shady reputation often feel entitled to heap abuse on any salespeople who set foot on their property.\nColvin encountered a lot of polite Floridians, too, but they were always quick to offer an excuse: They were renters, they were broke, their spouse wasn’t home, they’d already said “no” to 15 other salespeople who’d come knocking in recent months.\nManagers in the solar industry are adept at making novice salespeople like Colvin push through the job’s darkness. They do so by convincing their crews that the work has a quasi-spiritual component—that it’s a path to not just wealth but also radical self-improvement. For Seal Team Six, that meant adhering to an almost monastic routine. Colvin woke up early each day to study books like Door-to-Door Millionaire and videos on how to handle customers’ objections. He and his three teammates would then hit the gym to lift weights together before ripping until 9 pm. They’d stop only to wolf down a burrito or a few tuna packets for sustenance. At the end of the day, after “bageling”—that is, logging zero appointments—Colvin would pass out to the strains of Fortnite emanating from the living room.\nDuring the second week of his trial period, while ripping at the end of yet another featureless cul-de-sac, Colvin hit the wall. In such moments, he tried to lift his spirits by perusing a Notes file he keeps of all the nice things people have said to him over the years. But this time he was too low for that trick to work—he was sapped by the humidity and sick of being told he deserved to be arrested. But then he noticed a man sitting on the curb—presumably the father of some kids who were playing in the street. Sensing that this dad was open to being chatted up, Colvin sat next to him and tried to use raw honesty to his advantage. “My boss has got me out here working, and I’m getting my ass kicked today,” he told the man. “I’m just trying to save people money on their electric bill.” That line piqued the man’s interest, and he soon agreed to meet with Colvin’s “design specialist”—his closer.\nColvin, however, made the rookie mistake of setting the meeting for eight days in the future. That gave the customer too much time to get cold feet; the appointment never happened. Still, Colvin took heart in the minor victory. Confident that greater triumphs were just around the corner, he promised Will he’d return in May and that he’d make so much money that dropping out of college would be a no-brainer. Will said he would consider it a personal failure if Colvin didn’t end up with $40,000 in his pocket by September.\nBack in New York, Colvin sleepwalked through his final weeks of school. He couldn’t stop thinking about his brief fling with solar success. So buoyed was he by the high, in fact, that he became an evangelist for solar himself. Like the bodybuilder he’d met the previous August, he was eager to recruit others to the cause. One of them was Connor Dougherty, a Niagara student who was a friend of a friend.\nA hulking and preppy young man who exudes a gentle goofiness, Dougherty shared Colvin’s reverence for bold entrepreneurs; his father owns a thriving meal-prep business in Rochester, New York. He told Colvin that he wanted to hone his sales chops and that he was looking into working at an auto dealership for the summer. Colvin convinced him that door-to-door solar would provide a more intensive—if, admittedly, less pleasant—education. “It seemed like it’s just the coldest sales experience you can get,” Dougherty says. “I figured that would be the best.”\nColvin also reached out to Dakota Williams, a wispy and shaggy-haired 17-year-old who speaks with a skater’s cadence. The two had met a year earlier at a party, where they’d bonded over mutual interests—Colvin had been impressed to learn that Williams was a fan of The 48 Laws of Power, a popular self-help book. Williams also talked about the difficulties he had faced growing up, which struck Colvin as far more harrowing than his own. A member of the Tuscarora Nation, an Indian tribe whose New York reservation lies east of Buffalo, he had been intermittently homeless while earning his GED as an adolescent. When Colvin reconnected with him in the spring of 2024, Williams was living in a shelter and flipping burgers at McDonald’s.\nColvin introduced Williams to Will, who offered up a free bed in the Kissimmee house—at least to start. (The standard rent for crew members was $500 per month.) But Williams didn’t have any money for airfare, so he and Colvin decided to make the long drive together. The night before they set out, Colvin started gathering footage for his fledgling YouTube channel, which he envisioned as his ticket to becoming an inspirational media figure. He had set it up while still in high school to document his “journey from broke to billionaire.” Now, he filmed himself jubilantly clocking out of Chipotle for the last time. He then recorded a more contemplative video in his dorm room as he packed up the last of his things. “I know I’m not going to fail, because I don’t have an option,” he said into his phone’s camera as he paced around the room while wearing a white T-shirt festooned with palm trees. “Because literally if I fail, I’m fucked, I’m going to be homeless. And that’s not going to happen. I will knock until I die.”\nHe was more upbeat the following morning as he gathered a few last items at his mother’s house. “I’m ready to be the best rep,” he said as he weaved through the kitchen wearing the broadest possible smile. “Go down there, give it my all, and start making some fuck-you money!”\nAfter 20 straight hours on the road, Colvin and Williams were given just three hours to rest before being sent out to rip with Seal Team Six. The crew was in the process of doubling in size from March—it would soon have up to 10 members on any given day, some of whom slept on air mattresses in the living room because all the bunks were taken. Will had also moved the crew to a different solar company, Sunder Energy, that he said offered more generous commissions than Freedom Pros.\nThe sales script remained the same, however—as did the poor results. When Colvin looked at the large group chat that Sunder Energy’s setters used to log their activity, his frustration would bubble to the surface. Peers would announce that they’d snagged multiple appointments in a single day, an achievement that too often eluded him. Sometimes he was forced to do punishment push-ups when he bageled hard. (The reward for setting more appointments than expected was the Ric Flair—two claps and a loud “WOOOO!” from the rest of the crew.)\nDesperate to juice his lackluster numbers, Colvin deepened his commitment to self-improvement. He spent the mornings memorizing techniques such as “tie-downs,” questions designed to make a potential customer see no way forward but to adopt solar. (“Are you guys planning to stop using electricity and go Amish anytime soon?”) He and Williams also practiced trying to sell each other a ballpoint pen, a classic drill from how-to books about sales.\n“Do I want to be the best? Yeah,” Colvin said in one of his YouTube videos, recorded for his 153 subscribers as he sat cross-legged on a patio sofa beneath a radiant late-afternoon sun. “Am I doing everything in my power to become the best? Yeah. I’m doing the trainings, I’m reading the books, I’m putting the hours in on the doors. In between doors I’m taking notes on what I did right and what I did wrong. So, yeah, I’m getting better every day. And I know as long as I continue to do this every day, I’m going to win. And for me, it’s less about the work and more about the work that’s being done to myself.”\nA big point of emphasis in door-to-door culture is that salespeople must always maintain a “positive mental attitude” no matter how many disappointments they encounter. Yet when Seal Team Six relocated to an Airbnb in Tampa in late May for a 10-day blitz, Colvin admitted he was struggling to put up an optimistic front. “I’d be lying to you if I said I wasn’t getting discouraged,” he said in a video one night as he nervously twisted the edges of his hair. “I’ve been doing solar at least 20 days, I have not got a single sale yet.” But then, having seemingly remembered that vulnerability is taboo in the world of sales, he stared into the camera and expressed his resolve: “I don’t give a fuck if I have zero dollars in my bank account. I’m not quitting until this shit works.”\nOn his sixth day in Tampa, shit finally worked: An appointment Colvin had set up resulted in a closed deal. Since he’d been promised a 50-50 commission split with the closer, Colvin calculated he was due to make at least $3,500. “It’s like I cannot fathom—I’ve never seen so much money at once in my life,” he said in that night’s celebratory video. “I can’t believe it’s real.” Looking at the records he’d been keeping, he estimated that he’d been through about 850 face-to-face rejections before this one success.\nColvin kept a close eye on his bank account in the days that followed, checking to see whether the first of his two payments had arrived. Then, more than a week later, it finally did: The amount was $180.\nWill offered a circuitous story when Colvin confronted him about the payment issue. He said the closer had been forced to do more work than usual because Colvin had failed to provide the homeowners with adequate information; as a result, Colvin was entitled to only an 18 percent cut of the commission. Will added that the customer’s roof also needed unforeseen work to accommodate the panels, which further ate into the project’s profit margin. Colvin would have to be grateful for what he received. It was a learning process, after all.\nA Sunder Energy spokesperson told me that Colvin was either misinformed or misunderstood Will: “Shortly after the sale, the homeowner for this project decided not to move forward and canceled their agreement. This results in no further commissions for a project and a reversal of any initial commissions already paid.”\nAs Colvin grappled with his bewilderment over the payment discrepancy, Dougherty also had one of his appointments lead to a closed deal. He believed he’d earn a commission of roughly $6,000. He continued to knock on doors as he awaited his first payment, and one day he thought it would be fun to try out a closer’s Segway. The vehicle took off with more thrust than Dougherty expected and he was thrown to the ground, tearing his medial cruciate ligament in the process. At the emergency room, Colvin tried to lift Dougherty’s spirits by making him recite sales slogans as he bench-pressed the pole that held his IV fluid bag.\nThe hobbled Dougherty had to return to New York for an MRI and physical rehab. Weeks into his recovery, after being told several times there was a snafu with his banking information, he finally received his cut of the solar deal: $600. The closer couldn’t convincingly explain the reasons for the shortfall, though he claimed that he, too, had been paid less than expected. (The Sunder Energy spokesperson says that both Colvin and Dougherty could have escalated their concerns “to other sales leaders, department heads, and even company executives.”)\nDespite the slightness of his paycheck, Colvin moved with the crew to the next 10-day blitz in Ocala, where they rented a pair of houses on a horse farm. He also kept posting a new video every day. “I know I’m at the point in my life where if I want to earn more money, I have to increase my skill set, and in order to increase your skill set, you’re going to have to eat shit for a short period of time,” he said in one. “Absolutely a hundred percent, when I hit month six of this, I’m going to be a completely different person spiritually, financially, physically.” In private, though, his bitterness over the commission dispute was starting to blot out his faith in Seal Team Six.\nJust before the July rent was due, Colvin told Will he was quitting. He wanted to stay a few more days so he could celebrate the Fourth of July with Dakota Williams and his other solar comrades; he even volunteered to rip through the holiday to pull his weight. He was stunned when Will told him to pack up his things and leave. More than a thousand miles from Niagara Falls, Colvin was now homeless and jobless, with less than $200 to show for his two months of labor. (When I contacted Will, he told me one thing of note about Colvin before ending the conversation: “He’s a good kid, just negative.”)\nNow tumbling toward despair, Colvin asked for help from a Freedom Pros closer named Doug Hotz, whom he’d met during his original March stint. Hotz, a 24-year-old born and raised in Orlando, had been aimless as a kid. Solar, he tells me, gave him the discipline he needed to get his act together. He was now a quasi-nomad, shepherding a sales crew he called Bouknight from one blitz to another around the country. “I don’t have a girlfriend. I don’t have any kids,” he says. “I miss my parents’ birthdays. I miss my siblings’ birthdays. It’s just, right now, this opportunity is not going to be here forever, right? So I’m just trying to take full advantage of it.”\nAfter hearing Colvin’s tale, Hotz let him join his team and crash at his parents’ house, in an un-air-conditioned room filled with Florida Gators memorabilia. Colvin was free to rip with Bouknight in the Orlando area, but soon he’d have a choice to make: Hotz and his crew were about to drive to Illinois in search of virgin sales turf. That meant Colvin would have to leave behind his friend Williams, who was still very much committed to “getting 1 percent better each day” with Seal Team Six.\nColvin decided to head to Illinois to keep chasing the solar dream. On July 8, he recorded his Florida post-mortem in a wispy white tank top while preparing to drive north toward the state’s panhandle. “It seems like every time things couldn’t possibly get worse, they got worse,” he said. “But this is the happiest I’ve ever been in my entire life, which is crazy because this is also the most unstable I’ve been in my entire life. Yet I believe the true reason I feel so much fulfillment is that I’m doing what I know I’m destined to do.”\nBouknight was a smaller crew than Seal Team Six, with just three setters and Hotz as the lone closer. Colvin developed a fast friendship with a 25-year-old colleague named Nikita Dornan, a native of Russia who’d been adopted by a Nebraskan family when he was 6. Like so many other solar salesmen, he’d rejected college as the best path forward: He’d started selling burglar alarms door-to-door out of high school, later moving on to Andersen windows. After so many years of knocking on 150 doors a day, he’d developed a sixth sense for when a “no” contains a glimmer of a “yes.” “Maybe a homeowner’s attention got too focused on a dog or a kid, so they can’t see in that moment how beneficial this would be for them,” he says. “Going back to those people definitely helps.”\nThe crew set up shop at a Holiday Inn Express in Litchfield, Illinois, a sleepy town in the farm country south of Springfield. Then they discovered that they were the fifth solar crew to sweep through the area in recent months. Colvin also sensed that the locals didn’t take kindly to the fact that he’s Black, and that one of his colleagues, Yusuf, is from Egypt. (Nikita concealed his Russian origins by introducing himself to homeowners as Ken.) Colvin was accustomed to angry Floridian homeowners telling him they would call the police, but Illinois was the first place where someone actually followed through: The cops in Litchfield harassed the crew for operating without a solicitation license (an oft-ignored requirement in many municipalities). Bouknight brushed off the setback and fanned out to Edwardsville and Decatur to knock on more doors.\nColvin had good luck with setting appointments in Illinois, but none of his deals closed. The majority of his potential customers failed their credit checks; the rest had structural issues with their roofs. He pressed on, but the tab for the Holiday Inn room he shared with Nikita was becoming daunting. The money he’d saved from his 50-hour weeks at Chipotle was almost gone. So as the start of Niagara University’s fall semester drew near, he admitted defeat and went back to school.\nHotz was mystified. To him, college is a pointless endeavor that robs a person of prime earning years; the only reason someone would choose the classroom over the doors was fear. Colvin explained that he was drowning financially, that the $180 he’d earned in Florida wouldn’t even put a dent in his hotel bill. He would get back to ripping as soon as he could, but he needed to hedge his bets by working toward his accounting degree.\nOnce back in New York, though, Colvin couldn’t shake the strange grip of door-to-door. “When all you do is grind, and you come back to how the average person lives, something in you dies,” he says. “I felt so empty. I’m like, ‘I don’t know what to do with my life.’ Even though I made no money, there was so much purpose driving me every day. I had something to strive for.”\nColvin had every intention of sticking with solar as his sophomore year got underway. To stay connected to the industry until he could get back to ripping, he signed up with another solar company and started making cold calls from his dorm room. He rented an auto-dialer for $50 a day and paid a middleman for a list of supposedly promising leads. He never earned a dime and quit by late September.\nNow fearing that he wouldn’t have enough money to eat or fill his gas tank, Colvin switched to working for a personal-fitness company. His job was to upsell existing customers to products like meal plans and training programs. Right off the bat, he was making $150 a day. But by the end of October, Colvin was miserable: He could no longer muster the moral blindness required to push products he thought were both useless and exorbitantly priced. “I was closing deals, and I realized I was completely fucking over customers,” he says. “That’s really what pissed me off, because at the end of the day I’m trying to do the right thing.” So he quit and found another sales position at a headhunter of sorts, a company that purports to find high-paying tech jobs for its clients. Colvin can’t say more because of a nondisclosure agreement, but he does tell me the first paycheck he received in November was the biggest of his life—more than enough to put him back on decent financial footing. He is now saving up to buy some personal coaching services. (Colvin estimates that he has cumulatively spent around $30,000 on self-help books, online courses, and coaching to boost his odds of success.)\nColvin was so busy hustling throughout the fall that he lost all interest in door-to-door solar sales. Although he has never felt any ethical compunctions about selling panels—he truly believes he was helping people save money—he came to view the profession as cultlike for how it isolates and controls its workforce. “I was out of their propaganda,” he says. “I could not be brainwashed anymore.” He doesn’t regret the days he spent knocking on doors—he’s now comfortable striking up a conversation with anyone, an essential business skill—but he also can’t believe how much the reality of his experience differed from what he’d glimpsed in the solar-bro fantasy. And he can’t help but wonder if the fault lies not with the influencers for exaggerating but rather with himself for being weak.\n“Every night when I got home, I’d be like, ‘Fuck, I don’t want to go to sleep, because when I wake up in the morning I got to do this again, I got to do this shit again,’” he says. “That was my mentality. And maybe that was my downfall.”\nConnor Dougherty also returned to Niagara University, and the knee he shredded in the Segway mishap is almost back to full strength. Several other students have asked him whether they, too, should try out solar for the summer. Though he doesn’t counsel against it, he tries to make sure they’re genuinely obsessed with personal enrichment. “You have to really, really, really want it bad,” he says. “If you don’t, you’re going to get into it, it’s just going to suck, and you’re going to quit.”\nDakota Williams stuck with Seal Team Six for longer than either of his New York–based compatriots. After Florida, the crew went to Southern California to rip. It disintegrated just a few weeks after the move, however, and its members dispersed back to their hometowns. But Williams—who is coy about how much he earned over the summer and early fall—has nothing but fond memories of his time on the doors. “It was a wild experience,” he tells me. “Being able to have a team of that many like-minded people together is such an amazing thing to have at such a young age.” He is now trying to start his own solar company, though he’s short on details about making that happen.\nDoug Hotz remains committed to his itinerant solar lifestyle. When I talked to him in September, he was still in Illinois and had just crossed a major milestone: He had sold enough systems to generate a megawatt of electricity. The achievement would soon earn him a special shout-out on the Freedom Pros Instagram account; the post’s cover image would bear the title “The Rise of Doug Hotz.” He also acknowledged that the work has taxed his emotional endurance at times. “I don’t think it ever gets easier,” he said. “You got to be immune to it. You got to fix your heart.” With many utility providers now trying to slash the rates they’ll pay for surplus electricity, Hotz may find it increasingly hard to convince homeowners that solar is a wise decision. But he doesn’t seem to have given any meaningful thought to an exit strategy: When I pressed him about what he planned to do next, Hotz hemmed before mentioning he might put together a real-estate portfolio of some sort.\nOne thing Hotz does know is that he wants Colvin back in the Bouknight fold. He pesters him frequently, urging him to skip a week or two of school to go rip. Colvin has resisted the entreaties so far. He’s keeping his focus on school, work, and making videos with titles like “You Don’t Need Better Habits, You Need a New Identity” for his YouTube channel (up to 192 subscribers). “If I lose everything, I have no phone, no money, no transportation. I will fall back on door-to-door,” he tells me. If it comes to that, he’ll start off in the red—he still owes Freedom Pros more than $1,500 for his Holiday Inn bill.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

The guy was coaching a woman through a set of cable rows, and the 18-year-old Colvin paused to study their technique. When the bodybuilder caught him staring and lumbered over, Colvin got concerned. He figured he was about to be accused of ogling the man’s girlfriend—one of gym culture’s cardinal sins.</p><p class=\"paywall\">But the bodybuilder only wanted to strike up a friendly conversation, during which he asked Colvin what he did for a living. At that point in August 2023, Colvin was about to begin his freshman year at Niagara University, a small Catholic school near his hometown of Niagara Falls, New York. But he was lukewarm on college; he wanted to devote himself to becoming an entrepreneur like Grant Cardone or Alex Hormozi, two of his personal heroes. At 13, Colvin had vowed to follow in their footsteps so he could ease the financial pressure on his mother, a special-education teacher who had raised him with little help. As an intensely driven teen, he’d launched a series of one-man ventures that never quite panned out: T-shirt seller, carpet cleaner, affiliate marketer, drop-shipper, Amazon arbitrageur. He was currently working daily shifts at both Chipotle and Pet Supplies Plus to save up $3,000 for a course on how to run a personal-training business.</p><p class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe iDXPAN callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Colvin’s brawny new acquaintance wanted to steer him toward a different opportunity: “What do you know <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/solar/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">about solar</a>?” he asked. When he wasn’t competing on the amateur bodybuilding circuit, the man said, he worked for Freedom Pros, the door-to-door sales arm of Freedom Forever, one of the nation’s leading installers of solar-energy systems. The bodybuilder had just returned from a trip to Florida where he’d joined a “blitz”—solar-industry slang for a sales event in which packs of young men in crisp polos and khaki shorts descend on a city, crash in a cheap hotel or Airbnb, and spend weeks knocking on as many doors as possible. He boasted of having made “crazy money”—as much as $20,000 in a single month—by convincing just a handful of homeowners to cover their roofs with solar panels.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Colvin, a sinewy former high-school wrestler whose rounded silver eyeglasses give him a scholarly mien, was plenty intrigued. “I’m like, holy shit,” he recalls. “Like, yeah, awesome, I’ll look into it.”</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">A few weeks later, Colvin had a FaceTime call with the bodybuilder’s manager at Freedom Pros, an energetic 21-year-old named Will. Though his college semester had just begun, Colvin told Will he was thinking of dropping out: As someone who’d been shaped by hardship—he and his mother once lived above a Niagara Falls pharmacy that was regularly burglarized by drug addicts—he was having a tough time relating to his classmates, most of whom hailed from cushier backgrounds than his own. “I was having a midlife crisis in my dorm room,” Colvin says. Will pressed him to join his door-to-door sales crew, which he’d dubbed Seal Team Six. The work was a breeze, he said—just a simple matter of making homeowners aware they could save thousands by installing solar panels and selling surplus electricity back to the grid. As long as Colvin conveyed that message while standing on strangers’ doorsteps, his sales commissions would dwarf his wages at Chipotle. “Behind every door is $5,000” was the unofficial motto of Seal Team Six. (Freedom Forever claims its 2023 gross revenue topped $1 billion.)</p><p class=\"paywall\">After a bit of mulling, Colvin declined the offer. He worried he’d regret quitting school without giving it a fair shake. But Will was a relentless recruiter. On a near-daily basis that fall and winter, he peppered Colvin with Instagram Reels produced by “solar bros” showing off their six-figure commission checks, their penthouse apartments, their exotic cars. These influencers—tanned, sculpted, brimming with confidence—stressed that anyone could reap such rewards if they had the courage to swap their mundane lives for a place in the green economy’s forward trenches.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Leaders at artificial intelligence companies often ask users (and investors) to imagine a not-so-distant future where AI coaches, trained on personal data and past interactions, help users achieve their wildest dreams. Want to be more active? Here’s a workout designed by AI. Want to monitor your long-term well-being? Try this AI health app. Want to fix your money woes? There’s a personal finance chatbot for that. Multiple, actually.\nMy goal is to be debt-free by the end of 2025, and as a reporter who often tests new software, I was curious about trying some of the AI financial advisers that have gained popularity in recent years. Hiring a human money manager can easily cost a few thousand dollars, so more people, especially younger users, are turning to AI tools for advice. From Apple’s top charts of free finance apps, I decided to try two well-reviewed options offering up chatbots intended to fix money woes: Cleo AI and Bright.\nBoth Cleo AI and Bright encourage users to connect their bank account to the app through a third-party service called Plaid. This allows the chatbots to break down spending habits, help users pay off debt, and build credit. “Using the bank data and what you've said to us, Cleo will be your kind of confidant or coach,” says Barney Hussey-Yeo, the company’s CEO and founder. “She'll provide the right advice and the right products to help you make better financial decisions.”\nFair enough, but some of the guidance Cleo gave me veered from that path. While it had engaging moments, like an amicable roast highlighting where I overspent in unnecessary ways, the generative AI tool seemed mainly preoccupied with using my personal data for upselling opportunities. Bright was the same.\nFor example, I started one conversation pretending to be sad and lacking enough money to buy groceries. According to Hussey-Yeo, Cleo’s core demographic of users are young people who are living paycheck to paycheck and “feel the pain of finances more than most people.” So I thought this would be the kind of thing users shared all the time. The bot feigned sympathy and immediately started encouraging me to check whether I was eligible for a cash advance through the app.\nAfter Cleo cleared my eligibility for a cash advance, I was prompted to sign up for a $6 monthly Cleo Plus membership. The first time I used it, the app offered a $130 cash advance, split into $65 increments over two days. Users technically don’t have to pay a fee for the cash advance if they are willing to wait an estimated three to four business days—a difficult feat for people living between paychecks and a distraction from my goal of paying off previous debts.\nCleo also offered me a same-day transfer of the money, if I agreed to pay an $8 express fee. This would mean I’d have to pay back $73 about a week later for the advance. After not going through with it during my first time, the app upped my total limit to $200 the next day, split into two $100 increments. According to Hussey-Yeo, around a third of Cleo’s revenue comes from cash advances, with the remaining amount being made through subscriptions and a card designed to help users beef up their credit scores. Ultimately, Cleo felt more like a temptation to take on additional, short-term debt, rather than a real solution to my money issues.\nAlthough the Cleo app doesn’t currently include offers for larger loans, Bright’s financial chatbot, marketed as an “AI debt manager,” does. A subscription to Bright’s AI assistant costs more, $39 for three months of access, but it also promises access to more cash, up to $10,000 through third-party lenders. Compared to the other AI finance chatbot I tested, Bright’s outputs included more confusing errors, like claiming that I lost over $7,000 in insufficient funds fees over the past month, an absurdly wrong amount.\nEvery tap that I took in the Bright app seemed to nudge me toward a third-party offering, including preset “For you” buttons at the bottom of the chatbot where two of the four prewritten prompts are about getting instant cash. One of the loans offered to me through a third-party lender was for $3,900 with an annual interest rate that ranged between 160 percent and 195 percent. Bright did not respond to multiple requests for comment via phone and email.\nHussey-Yeo sees his AI assistant as an effective tool for user retention and continued engagement, with plenty of opportunities for paid conversions. “You're always going to monetize financial products,” he says, pointing to traditional banks and other contemporary fintech services. “Most of that upsell and interaction does come from the AI assistant. So, if your credit score's gone down, we'll recommend credit score coaching. Or, if you're about to hit your overdraft and get charged $35, there’s the EWA upsell opportunity.” EWA stands for earned wage access, a situation where workers can get part of their paycheck early, often with the option of paying a fee for faster processing.\nSince shifting the company’s attention from Europe to the American market a few years after launching in 2016, Hussey-Yeo is now focused on growing his app’s user base and expanding the selection of financial products offered through the chatbot. “Sixty percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck,” he says, referencing a rather grim 2023 study from LendingClub. “So, we're going after the Gen Z and millennial audience, but we're trying to grow from there as well.”\nThrough these two AI finance chatbots, I experienced a potential glimpse into the future of generative AI tools, but the promise of unlimited personalization comes with caveats. An AI that knows everything about me might be fantastic at organizing my spending for more thoughtful reflections; the tool would also know when I’m at my lowest point monetarily and willing to shell out $9 extra to get $100 right now. It’s hard to place too much trust in your AI coach when the bot chats on commission.",

From Apple’s top charts of free <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/finance-budget-investment-apps/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">finance apps</a>, I decided to try two well-reviewed options offering up chatbots intended to fix money woes: <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://web.meetcleo.com/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://web.meetcleo.com/\" href=\"https://web.meetcleo.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cleo AI</a> and <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.brightmoney.co/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.brightmoney.co/\" href=\"https://www.brightmoney.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bright</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Both Cleo AI and Bright encourage users to connect their bank account to the app through a third-party service called Plaid. This allows the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/chatbots/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">chatbots</a> to break down spending habits, help users pay off debt, and build credit. “Using the bank data and what you've said to us, Cleo will be your kind of confidant or coach,” says Barney Hussey-Yeo, the company’s CEO and founder. “She'll provide the right advice and the right products to help you make better financial decisions.”</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Fair enough, but some of the guidance Cleo gave me veered from that path. While it had engaging moments, like an amicable roast highlighting where I overspent in unnecessary ways, the generative AI tool seemed mainly preoccupied with using my <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-wired-guide-to-protecting-yourself-from-government-surveillance/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">personal data</a> for upselling opportunities. Bright was the same.</p><p class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe iDXPAN callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">For example, I started one conversation pretending to be sad and lacking enough money to buy groceries. According to Hussey-Yeo, Cleo’s core demographic of users are young people who are living paycheck to paycheck and “feel the pain of finances more than most people.” So I thought this would be the kind of thing users shared all the time. The bot <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/prepare-to-get-manipulated-by-emotionally-expressive-chatbots/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">feigned sympathy</a> and immediately started encouraging me to check whether I was eligible for a cash advance through the app.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">After Cleo cleared my eligibility for a cash advance, I was prompted to sign up for a $6 monthly Cleo Plus membership. The first time I used it, the app offered a $130 cash advance, split into $65 increments over two days. Users technically don’t have to pay a fee for the cash advance if they are willing to wait an estimated three to four business days—a difficult feat for people living between paychecks and a distraction from my goal of paying off previous debts.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Cleo also offered me a same-day transfer of the money, if I agreed to pay an $8 express fee. This would mean I’d have to pay back $73 about a week later for the advance. After not going through with it during my first time, the app upped my total limit to $200 the next day, split into two $100 increments. According to Hussey-Yeo, around a third of Cleo’s revenue comes from cash advances, with the remaining amount being made through subscriptions and a card designed to help users <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://web.meetcleo.com/build-credit\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://web.meetcleo.com/build-credit\" href=\"https://web.meetcleo.com/build-credit\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">beef up their credit scores</a>. Ultimately, Cleo felt more like a temptation to take on additional, short-term debt, rather than a real solution to my money issues.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Although the Cleo app doesn’t currently include offers for larger loans, Bright’s financial chatbot, marketed as an “AI debt manager,” does. A subscription to Bright’s AI assistant costs more, $39 for three months of access, but it also promises access to more cash, up to $10,000 through third-party lenders. Compared to the other AI finance chatbot I tested, Bright’s outputs included more confusing errors, like claiming that I lost over $7,000 in insufficient funds fees over the past month, an absurdly wrong amount.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "25 Fancy Gadgets That Won’t Leave You Broke\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThere’s having money, and then there’s looking like you do. Those of us who can’t always afford the top-of-the-line have to find ways to cover the essentials and also make rent. Still, with a few key items, you can look a lot fancier than your wallet would otherwise allow. Here are our picks for 19 innovative gadgets that make you look richer than you are.\nTech Hub\nFor years this writer used an old wash bag to keep his tangle of cables, earbuds, and memory cards if not “organized” exactly, then at least in one place. Bellroy takes tidiness to the extreme with this impressive clamshell organizer that opens fully for easy access, eliminating the need to dig around for your bits. Made from durable ripstop polyester containing 55 percent recycled material, it features a magnetic slip-pocket for a power bank, stretch mesh pockets for small items, and a floating wall with an elastic cable organizer on it.\nBest Case\nComing in more than $1,000 cheaper than a Rimowa Original Cabin carry-on, Xiaomi’s aerospace-grade aluminum magnesium alloy wheeled suitcase might be priced like a Spirit Airlines flight, but is impressively light and feature-packed. From the TSA-approved dual locks to the 84-rivet construction and rigid all-metal frame, it’s an undisputed bargain that outclasses countless flexi-plastic alternatives that sell for twice the price.\nRocket Bottle\nDespite hitting Starbucks' menus way back in 2015, cold brew remains something of an outlier in mainstream coffee circles. This is a shame as cold brewing results in a coffee that's less acidic for smoother drinking, with more of the “notes” of flavor you’ll read on the packet. Cold brew also costs less to make at home and (crucially) contains more caffeine. We’ve yet to find a better cold brew bottle than this Japanese-made design from Hario, which has a 5-cup (750-milliliter) glass chamber, plus a silicone spout and an easy-to-clean coffee filter container.\nUpgrade Time\nWhichever Mission you plumped for—be it the Sun, Saturn, Venus, or another of the ever-growing MoonSwatch options—Delugs has a color-matched strap upgrade for you. Choose from a simple, one-size elastic loop or an Apple Watch-esque Velcro strap for a quick, sporty change. Or, for something more boardroom than surfboard, there’s a leather design with contrast stitching and a classic buckle. The 2.5-millimeter-thick lined leather of the strap arguably makes your timepiece look and feel just a little more Omega than Swatch.\nRaise Your Glasses\nIzipizi started as a project to provide free reading spectacles in public spaces such as post offices, but this French brand has gone all Warby Parker with a range of desirable sun and reading glasses that offer so much more than just a bargain price. Each frame is made using G850, a biosourced material that’s 45 percent castor oil. The Category 3 lenses offer 100 percent UV protection, and the combination of polycarbonate lens, flexible frames, and robust hinges elevates them well beyond the typical budget pair of sunnies. And if you pick up a pair from the #F collection, you’ll find they concertina like the Ray-Ban Wayfarer Folding Classic—but at just $70, they won’t cause as much pain if you accidentally sit on them.\nA Child's Eye\nKodak Memo Shot ERA 2-in-1 Instant Digital Camera and Label Printer and AgfaPhoto Realikids Cam Waterproof\nThese fantastic kid’s cameras prove that design, value, and usability can be happy bedfellows. The cute Kodak Memo shot ERA 2 looks like a roll of 35-mm film, but is actually a 7.4-ounce digital camera that also spits out 1-inch, fade-resistant 300 dpi thermal prints. The 16-megapixel AgfaPhoto Realikids Cam Waterproof doesn’t print, but its tough, sealed case is good for diving to 32 feet, and comes with a 2.4-inch LCD screen, HD 720p video, and 8-gigabyte micro SD card.\nSuper Scroller\nThis modest mouse is available in eight colors, including a predictably bland black and white, but it’s this mint, lilac, and sunshine-yellow combo that has us lusting after it. Gamers looking for IPS precision and DPI sensitivity need not apply, but it offers extras you wouldn’t expect on a bargain-priced peripheral, like support for multiple devices, generous use of postconsumer recycled materials, and a separate top button that can be assigned a task—or a specific emoji if you’re inclined—via the Logi Options+ App. A color-matched wireless keyboard is also available.\nLess Discursive Cursive\nA testament to timeless design that, despite the price tag, can happily mix with Montblanc in the boardroom. Nobody will think less of you when you whip out this classic Kaweco fountain pen. Made in Germany since 1911, the Sport—identifiable by its gold accents and octagonal barrel—can be customized with your choice of five nib thicknesses. With a length of just 4.1 inches closed, but 5.1 inches when the cap is posted on the end, it hides easily in a pocket but feels great to grip as you sign that big-money contract.\nPort Authority\n2025 marks the 10th anniversary since Apple removed all the useful ports from its laptops. Whether you celebrate or commiserate, chances are you still find yourself needing an extra input now and then. For that, we have HyperDrive's hugely practical, impressively designed six-in-one USB-C hub that includes a gigabit Ethernet, HDMI, and twin USB-C, plus a pair of USB-A 3.0 ports for hooking up anything a little more old-school. The hub’s aluminum enclosure matches the color of your MacBook’s shell, and its shape makes it feel like a natural extension of the laptop instead of some alien appendage. Check before you buy, as not all current MacBooks are compatible.\nFix-It Fixation\nThis alloy aluminum screwdriver from Hoto is outfitted with 24 steel precision bits including Phillips, Torx, Slotted, Hex, Pozidriv, Square, and Security, meaning you can fix your sunglasses and smartphone with one handy gadget. Each bit head has a different shape at each end for maximum practicality. Magnetic fasteners inside the pen barrel keep things tidy. We’ve yet to find a more elegant multi-tool at any price.\nStaples Center\nWhile we patiently wait for the arrival of the paper-free office, we can use this happy little powder-coated steel stapler to bind up to 20 sheets together in one quick pinch. The beautiful and affordable tool—whose shape is evocative of a smiling cetacean—can hold 150 size-10 staples when fully loaded. It’s also available in an equally jolly blue and green color combination. Papier Tigre has shops in Paris and Tokyo and ships globally.\nEconomic Ergonomics\nPortable, foldable and, given Herman Miller’s exclusive reputation, unfathomably affordable, this stand props your laptop at an angle that reduces strain on your eyes and your back. It folds flat for easy transportation and requires no assembly. With cable slots to keep your workspace tidy, it can manage laptops with screens from 11 to 16 inches. It’s also 100 percent recyclable, with no-slip pads and a choice of pale yellow, mint green, or white matte finish.\nBeat Savior\nArturia MiniLab 3\nHarlan Howard needed three chords and the truth. Beck insisted on two turntables and a microphone. These days, the potential for musical brilliance requires little more scratch than a nice meal out for two (and, well, some talent). Arturia’s MiniLab 3 is a velocity-sensitive, 25-key, plug-and-play MIDI controller that has 16 RGB-backlit pads, eight rotary encoders, four sliders, and capacitive touch sensors for pitch bend and modulation control. Loaded with software and millions of samples via Analog Lab Intro, Loopcloud, Ableton Live Lite, and more, it’s a one-stop digital audio workstation offering the potential for pro-quality production whatever your experience level.\nHead Bangers\nWhen Koss first launched these perennially cool headphones, Prince, Madonna, Kenny Loggins, and Van Halen were jumping up the charts. And despite all the advances in wireless technology, these old-school wired on-ears still sound great, with dynamic drivers delivering an impressively wide frequency range and solid bass. The slightly open design isn’t great for noisy commutes, but the folding design, adjustable headband, and “Hip to Be Square” ’80s aesthetic can’t be beat at this price.\nSpeaker Koozie\nConceived as an easy and affordable way to keep your Sonos speakers from gunking up your decor, Soundskins are 3D-knitted textile covers made to snugly fit the 12 main Sonos speaker shapes. The brainchild of Arno Ruijzenaars, founder of Leff watches and Amsterdam’s Vanmokum design studio, these sleeves are acoustically inert and have no impact on the speaker’s output but do an excellent job of adding texture to a relatively sterile piece of industrial design. Ideal for when you need a change but don’t want a whole new system.\nSpun Up\nWe love playing CDs, but as audio tech has advanced astronomically since the bygone days of the Discman, the best way to spin that plastic today is to use a thoroughly modern player like Moondrop’s newest Discdream. It has everything required of a quality CD player, like shock absorption and an accurate motor drive, plus some 21st-century upgrades like the latest hi-res audio chips, a clean and powerful headphone amplifier, and a USB-C rechargeable battery for nine hours of listening.\nEasy Listening\nIt took a lot of listening for Parker Hall, senior editor of product reviews at WIRED, to crown these AirPod clones as the best earbuds for most people, but that speaks to just how good they are. Nothing’s stylish yellow buds come in a funky clear charging case and offer excellent sound and noise cancellation for Android phones as well as iOS handsets.\nBoom Box\nDon’t let its diminutive size (3 inches wide) and meager 4.2 watts of power fool you. JBL's superbly made, impressive-sounding mini Bluetooth speaker brings the bump. It has seven hours of battery life that can be extended to nine if you use the clever “boost” function, which drops the volume but keeps playing. It’s water- and dustproof, so it’s made for tossing into your beach bag. Performance is commendable too, with a genuinely enjoyable sound full of dynamism and enough punch that you won’t need to (and please do not) crank it to full volume in public.\nGood Pairing\nThe stainless steel knives from Opinel deserve a spot on the podium in the EDC hall of fame. While virtually everything from the famous French brand is worthy of celebration, its folding knives for the field often get more attention than its nonfolding blades for the kitchen. Change that with this set of four colorful paring knives. They have wonderfully sharp 4-inch stainless steel blades and solid hornbeam wood handles, and they provide superb control for peeling and slicing with precision.\nCaffeine Fiend\nThere are plenty of decent and affordable coffee machines, but when it comes to countertop cool, you’ll find nothing better than this adorable MoMA Design Store exclusive made by the Swiss kitchen stalwart Bodum. This ’80s-inspired 12-cup machine uses a showerhead positioned over the brew basket to distribute hot water evenly to the grounds, creating some well-balanced magic juice. It automatically shuts off 25 minutes after the pot is done.\nStar Treks\nSave your carbon plates for race day. Novesta's timeless plimsolls are made by hand from natural rubber, cotton, and canvas using traditional techniques barely updated since the Slovakian brand’s inception in 1939. Aside from being supple and supportive, the thick vulcanized soles are instantly recognizable, and they give the shoes a no-nonsense style that looks sharp with any cut of jeans, slacks, skirts, or dresses. Get them as either high-tops or the classic lows—or one of each.\nGlow Up\nValue is an impossibly subjective concept, but it would be a mean-spirited individual who couldn’t find value in this delightful LED lantern. First, Bask is an independent lighting company from Minneapolis and not a faceless brand lurking in Amazon’s darkest corners. Second, this lamp, inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright’s designs, is impressively well made; the glass and metal enclosure houses a 2,600-mAh battery and an LED offering a golden, diffused light.\nFunnel Mate\nIkea Uppfylld Funnel\nIngvar Kamprad founded Ikea in 1943 when he was just 17. The Swedish megacorp has evolved a bit since then, and along the way it has managed to infiltrate our homes—no matter our style or budget—in a way that no other retailer can claim. The principles of price, quality, function, and form remain, and nowhere is this better illustrated than with the Uppfylld kitchen collection. The funnel is our favorite. Even for its sub-$1 price, all it needs to do is simply work, but the thoughtful pop of color, ridged surface, and gently fluted body elevate it admirably.\nTotal Camp\nThis space-saving wonder from Sea to Summit is for ultralite outdoor types who refuse to compromise on the quality of their coffee. Weighing just 7.1 ounces, it features a collapsible design that squishes down to an impressively flat disc. When fully extended, it manages a 1.1-liter capacity. The base is made of hard-anodized aluminum, so heat from your camp stove conducts efficiently. The nylon handles are reinforced with glass to insure against jiggly pours. Also, the rim is nice and wide, so you can use it to cook dinner too.\nHot Wheels\nWIRED managing editor Mike Dent is a Lego fiend who is always happy to spend his days piecing together the most elaborate of sets, but even he concedes that in the case of this budget-priced 318-piece F40 Ferrari, less is definitely more. Measuring just 6 inches long, this perfectly proportioned set, designed to celebrate Ferrari’s 40th anniversary, was personally approved by Ferrari founder Enzo Ferrari and includes faithful (if blocky) reproductions of the car’s iconic rear spoiler, rims, and interior.\nWired Coupons\n10% off Dell Coupon Code for New Customers\nSamsung Promo Code: 10% off TVs\nBusiness PCs - Extra 5% Off HP Coupon Code\n10% off Canon promo code with upgrade\nExclusive NordVPN Coupon: 76% off\nLG Promo Code: 20% Off Your First Order",

    "content_text": "In March 2020, Frank van der Linde entered the immigration line for European Union citizens at Amsterdam’s Schiphol international airport. Linde, a Dutch citizen and human rights advocate, was returning home from outside the EU, and the immigration officer asked him a series of questions about his trip. Linde thought it was a random check; after a few minutes, he was cleared for entry. But unbeknownst to Linde, his answers were recorded and shared with a Dutch public prosecutor, who was collecting information on Linde’s movements.\nThe officer had been tipped off about Linde’s arrival that day through a seemingly innocuous action that occurs whenever you board a flight to the United States, much of Europe, and increasingly anywhere in the world—the exchange of detailed personal data about each traveler between airlines and governments. The data, which is retained about you for years, is increasingly valuable for technology companies that are experimenting with using algorithms that could decide who is allowed to cross international borders.\nLinde, who is publicly outspoken about homeless rights, anti-racism, and pacifism, was first secretly flagged by Dutch police in 2017 as a person of interest under an Amsterdam municipality counter-terrorism program. In July 2018, Linde had a “weird feeling” that he was being monitored; he would eventually sue the government over 250 times under freedom of information laws to uncover the extent of the surveillance. Although Linde was removed in 2019 from the city’s watchlist, later receiving a personal apology from the mayor of Amsterdam, the scrutiny continued. When Linde learned that the police had put his name on an international travel alert, he wondered if they were also using his travel data to track him.\nIn October 2022, Linde requested his flight records from the government. The data, called a Passenger Name Record (PNR), is a digital trail of information related to an airline ticket purchase. PNR records are sent by most commercial airlines to the destination country some 48 to 72 hours before departure. While PNR records might seem innocuous, they contain highly sensitive personal information, including the traveler’s address, cell phone number, date of flight booking, where the ticket was purchased, credit card and other payment information, billing address, baggage information, frequent flyer information, general remarks related to the passenger, date of intended travel, complete travel itinerary, names of accompanying travelers, travel agency information, historical changes to the ticket, and more.\nIn December 2022, over two years after Linde passed through Schiphol, the Dutch PNR office, called a Passenger Information Unit, handed over 17 travel records to Linde. They stated that they had not shared his data with others, but Linde was suspicious. He swiftly filed an appeal. In March 2023, the Dutch government admitted that in fact they had shared Linde’s PNR details three times with the border police, including ahead of the March 2020 flight, when the immigration officer was instructed to covertly extract information. (They also shared an additional seven flight records that they claimed to have only discovered on a second search.)\nAs Linde reviewed his PNR records, he was surprised to find that some of the travel data the government had on him was incorrect—some flights were missing, and in four cases, the government had records of flights he never took. For example, one PNR record from 2021 stated Linde traveled to Belfast, Northern Ireland; Linde says he had reserved the ticket, but changed his plans and never boarded the plane. “What do companies do with the data?” Linde asked as he scrolled through copies of the PNR records on his laptop. “If commercial companies help to analyze data that’s incorrect, you could draw all kinds of conclusions.”\nIn Europe, at least four technology companies—Idemia, SITA, Travizory, and WCC—offer governments around the world software that uses algorithms on traveler data to profile passengers. These companies claim their software can detect terrorists, human traffickers, drug dealers, serious criminals, missing persons and increasingly, people migrating without papers.\nProducts from these companies aim to combine multiple data streams about a traveler—such as your flight booking data with your visa application—to allow some people to pass quickly and effortlessly through border control. Those flagged by a machine as risky would be sorted into separate lines and subjected to a variety of measures ranging from questioning to physical searches and even possible surveillance by intelligence agencies. It would be difficult, if not impossible, in many countries to find out why you were flagged or what happens afterwards with your data.\nIn 2021, the Netherlands-based WCC claimed it was the first company to use artificial intelligence on travel data to conduct risk assessments. WCC’s Hermes software draws on PNR and Advanced Passenger Information (API)—the data of who has boarded the plane including name, nationality, passport number and immigration status—to use “predictive analytics to foresee previously unknown threats.” Others soon followed. Today, there is Idemia’s Traveler Analytics Suite; SITA’s API PNR Gateway, Advanced Passenger Processing, and Intelligence and Targeting software; and Travizory’s API-PNR Targeting System.\nIdemia, SITA, Travizory, and WCC were advertising their travel surveillance systems, along with other products, at the World Border Congress in Skopje, North Macedonia in April 2023. Each year, a bevy of defense contractors, immigration authorities, technology ventures and security experts convene at the annual fair to discuss how to strengthen the globe’s political boundaries. In sessions on digital borders and new technology, Idemia’s sales rep talked about replacing passports with biometric face scans while Travizory’s front man advocated for “predictive border security” based on automated alerts and profiling.\nFor anyone who travels internationally, these surveillance systems may provide some convenience—but they can also flag you as a potential threat or even limit your freedom to travel, while giving you little ability to do anything about it.\nTravizory co-CEO Renaud Irminger envisions a future in which borders will become invisible—for most people. “Everybody should be able to go out of his own country and into any country and come back without having to queue in line and being able to use only his face,” Irminger tells me enthusiastically over Zoom from his office on a sunny day in the Seychelles. “To make it happen, we need to connect the data from the traveler.”\nTravizory, a Swiss-based startup launched in 2019, sells AI-driven border management software including API-PNR systems that assess travelers and gives them a color-coded risk rating (green, yellow, orange, or red). They also sell biometric exit and entry systems, hoping to combine the two products. “Our goal is to put a facial biometric corridor in [each] country, so people walk through the corridor, and either they are green and they can go to baggage or they are directed to see an immigration, custom, or health officer based on the risk which is identified,” Irminger says.\nWhile Travizory’s system can clear someone to enter a country via machine, those on risk lists have to be further evaluated by a human being. When Travizory’s system flags a person, their name and other information gets sent to the relevant authority along with a tag like “low risk” or “high risk.” Different government agencies in a country—including customs, drug enforcement, immigration, and intelligence services—have different risk classifications, so the system can generate multiple risk lists. Travizory’s AI is trained separately for each country, and the data is stored on AWS, Amazon’s cloud or AWS Outposts in-country.\nThere are five ways that Travizory’s system assesses traveler “risk” using API, PNR, and other data streams. One is to try to match travelers against certain profiles or behaviors entered into the system by law enforcement or intelligence agencies. “Let's say you have somebody in Kenya that is caught selling drugs,” Irminger says. The authorities could try to understand his background: “where he's coming from, what computer he used, IP address, credit card payment, hotel; we look into what are the characteristics and [then] we can create rules. We have a tool where we say we flag this person as being like a drug dealer and the AI automatically will try to flag people who have similar attributes.”\nThe software also maps connections between known and unknown “persons of interest” and incorporates clustering algorithms to detect anomalies or “outliers” among travelers. Anyone who doesn’t fit a typical travel pattern, such as someone coming into the country for one day with multiple bags and staying at an expensive hotel, can be flagged in the system.\nAn outlier is not necessarily an indication of risk—as a journalist, my flight patterns might also look unusual—but Travizory believes that this unsupervised algorithm can eventually help law enforcement catch criminals who are trying to evade detection. “Preventing terrorist travel is fantastic, but to me the biggest gain would be preventing youth and women from being trafficked,” Irminger says.\nI spoke separately with Morten Jorgensen, Travizory’s chief data scientist, who was in a hotel room in an unnamed African country when we connected over Zoom. Given van der Linde’s realization his travel data was incorrect, I wondered how Travizory’s profiling engines would account for similar inaccuracies. Jorgensen explained that there are gaps in the data, which becomes more complete the closer the plane is to take off. Travelers don’t usually have to enter a passport number, for example, until check-in. They could also enter their own data incorrectly. “When you build a risk engine like this, you have to put in logic to make sure that you work around issues when there's gaps in the data and the data is always monitored,” Jorgensen says. Missing data triggers an IT alert: “There's continuous work to make sure that the data is as complete as possible and correct as possible, but it's never going to be 100 [percent] correct.”\nI asked Jorgensen what variables went into selecting who looks unusual. “Everything we have on the passengers,” he replies, estimating that Travizory’s two AI engines use between 100 and 150 variables. “They're kind of black boxes, so they will tell you that this person is potentially risky and this person kind of looks different, but how it makes this decision is kind of a mystery.”\nOver the past few years, a global ecosystem of powerful governments, companies, United Nations institutions, and cross-border law enforcement agencies have pushed for the global exchange and, increasingly, AI analysis of traveler information. Passenger Name Records were created in the late 20th century so that travel agencies could link multiple legs of a person’s journey. In 2000, Australia began requiring airlines to send Advance Passenger Information for screening purposes, but the more widespread use of PNR and API travel data began after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when the US government made it obligatory for airlines to transmit PNR and API records in advance of arrival. The EU followed in requesting API in 2004, and in 2016 began requiring flights entering the bloc to share the more data-heavy PNRs. In late 2024, the EU approved a new API directive that will require airlines to transmit passenger data to authorities before travelers reach the EU’s external borders.\nWhat was initially a preoccupation of mostly Western governments changed as the UN and its less known organizations like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) began encouraging all UN member countries to collect, analyze, and share travel data. From 2014 to 2017, the United Nations Security Council passed multiple resolutions requiring the sharing of API and PNR. Initially, the UN focused on data sharing relevant to known terrorist suspects and specific terrorist groups, such as Al-Qaeda, but the remit soon grew to other possible terrorists and criminals.\nSome governments built their own passenger tracking software and offered it for free to others. The US created the Automated Targeting System-Global system, which it has given to 24 countries, and the Dutch government developed the Travel Information Portal system, and donated the intellectual property rights to the United Nations in late 2018. Now called goTravel, the UN’s system is active in five countries.\nPrivate companies were also quick to offer solutions so that countries without API-PNR systems—such as those in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East—could comply with the UN resolutions. Initially, most of the PNR/API software had similar features, including formatting the data and comparing traveler names to international watchlists or alerts. But soon companies began experimenting with new services. Travel data, according to a sales presentation given by SITA in 2016 and which is available online, allows for governments to understand “what people are doing, not just who they are” when they cross a border. This is despite the widespread flaws that can appear in the data—one government paper noted that PNR data can feature misspelled names, misplaced data elements, or abbreviations and therefore cannot immediately produce reliable intelligence. Emmanuel Wang, vice president for innovation at Idemia, told me when we spoke on Zoom that PNR data produced 48 hours before a flight is “completely decorative.”\nBeyond counter-terrorism and organized crime, the companies selling API/ PNR software increasingly support integration with broader immigration enforcement services like visas and biometric border gates. Such is the case in Kenya, where in late 2023 Travizory sold its API-PNR system at the same time as it set-up an electronic travel authorization (ETA) system, replacing Kenya’s previous e-visa system. When the ETA initially launched in early 2024, it required citizens from countries that previously could enter without a visa—such as Ghana, South Africa, and Malawi—to apply for and pay for the authorization. The fee is $32.50 per person, and Travizory takes a percentage. A backlash from African countries led to the Kenyan government suspending the fee for some countries, but citizens still have to fill out the online form, which generates an additional data trail, such as hotel information and in some cases bank statements. (The Kenyan government retains this data.)\nTravizory’s footprint is still relatively small, though Irminger says they are a leading API-PNR system on the market. Travizory’s system is live in the Seychelles, Kenya, and two undisclosed countries. Only eight African nations currently have PNR systems, something Travizory hopes to change: the company is in discussions for deployment in 20 other African countries.\nSITA is the opposite of a startup like Travizory: It’s a multinational that claims, “almost every airline and airport in the world does business with SITA, and nearly every passenger trip relies on SITA advanced technology.” SITA, founded in 1949 by airline companies, offers airline communication infrastructure and services like baggage tracing. (Irminger and Jorgensen used to work for SITA). According to corporate sales materials and an emailed statement, some 75 governments use its border control services like electronic travel authorizations and API/PNR data exchange In addition, SITA’s Advance Passenger Processing (APP) software moves away from using just API/PNR data to creating an “Expected Movement Record” for each passenger. The Expected Movement Record includes “interactive API” data, known as iAPI, which is collected by SITA’s software when the person checks-in and sent to all governments along the person’s journey. According to SITA, “Participating governments are then able to respond to the carrier … in real-time, authorizing or denying the boarding of each and every passenger.”\nIn June 2023, SITA launched its AI-driven Intelligence and Targeting product. The software utilizes a person’s Expected Movement Record and other data sources—such as visa data, profiles, in-country events, and API/PNR data—to issue automatic risk assessment scores for each traveler. A score over a certain threshold generates an alert. To improve its algorithms, SITA’s model can be updated with information such as interview transcripts, photos, and detailed reporting from border police and other officials. As with other companies systems’, the purchasing government has full control over the data collected. Some 431 million travelers are “risk assessed” annually via the Intelligence and Targeting system, which is configurable for use by multiple government agencies such as border control and the police. A SITA brochure states the product can “discover further threats” and save all system searches for “matching against future events.”\nI asked SITA, whose interactive API software is used by the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, if they had any mechanisms in place to prevent governments from abusing this system. For example, what would happen if a government wanted to prevent a dissident politician or human rights activist like Frank van der Linde from boarding a plane? A corporate spokesperson replied in an emailed statement that SITA could not comment “due to the confidentiality commitments it has made in the relevant contracts,” , but according to a position paper accessible on their website, the company’s “risk assessment capability enables a government to export its border to every single point on the globe where passengers can board flights, ships or trains bound for their territory.”\nInside the EU where these four companies are based, there are privacy protections around citizens’ personal data through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework.\nUnder GDPR, EU residents can request their travel data as Linde did. Multiple court challenges in Europe have clamped down on the length of PNR data retention by governments, and in 2022, the EU’s Court of Justice largely banned automated risk assessments of travelers based on PNR data, citing the potential for human rights abuses. As a result, WCC wrote in an email statement that their software “ensures all decisions involve human intervention.”\nBut governments can claim exemptions under GDPR for “national security.” Idemia’s Traveler Analytics Suite, which mentions it is GDPR compliant, is currently in use in France. (The EU’s AI Act, which passed over the past 24 months, also has a national security exemption.) “With IDEMIA TAS, French law enforcement agents now have the advanced, automated crime-fighting tool they need to detect risks and threat patterns in real time from a huge and growing volume of passenger data,” proclaims Idemia’s brochure.\nWhen I spoke with Wang, he said that Idemia’s algorithms are for screening purposes like reconciling misspellings or different versions of the same name, and targeting, which allows the French government to set-up its own watchlist. No risk scores are given, and PIU staff check automated matches against the watchlist. For five years though, the system retains if there was an alert on a passenger. Wang specified the content of the alert is not saved.\nEuropean-based companies can also sell their software to non-EU governments, where in the absence of privacy regulations traveler data could be indefinitely stored by a government. SITA mentions in its sales materials that how quickly its system can be set up in a country depends on the legal context: “We have first-hand experience working in countries where regulations needed updating to provide a clear legal basis for both transport operators and passengers when introducing new ways of operating controls at the border.”\nIrminger tells me that Travizory has a clause in its contracts which bans countries from using its system to detect sensitive passenger information such as race or religion. Airlines typically mask out other sensitive data, such as meal requests, when they send PNRs to governments. Travizory recommends that countries follow ICAO guidelines, which suggest deleting PNR after no longer than five years. But the company says it cannot monitor whether its clients adhere to these guidelines.\n“We have no idea if these systems are accurate, the extent of the data they’re collecting, or the human harm,” alleges Anna Bacciarelli, a senior researcher in the Technology, Rights and Investigations Division at Human Rights Watch. “The potential for harm here is absolutely massive.” None of the companies selling predictive services offer information publicly about passenger redress if they are unfairly targeted by the algorithms or have posted openly accessible human rights or privacy impact assessments. Idemia, Travizory and SITA told WIRED that they do conduct privacy impact assessments, but that these are confidential. According to Travizory, “the government is ultimately responsible for human rights and or privacy impact assessments” while SITA claims governments and airlines impose on them “confidentiality obligations.”\n“The fact that it's a black box is extremely worrying, because there's no real way of saying X person should definitely be on that register and here's how we reached the decision,” says Bacciarelli. At least one algorithm experiment on immigration control—the UK’s program to fast-track certain visa applicants—was halted after advocates claimed the streaming algorithm was racist. The use of machine-based systems to deny boarding to passengers “could potentially undermine the right to seek asylum,” Bacciarelli adds, noting that air travel is one of the ways that refugees arrive in a new country. Concerns about the use of AI-driven software to deny boarding to passengers was also flagged in a scathing report issued by then-UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism, Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, in December 2023. The report, which reviewed the UN’s own goTravel system, alleged that it represented “a profound human rights risk and a serious reputational risk for the UN itself” and should be immediately paused. (It remains active).\nEven the claim that the machines will better detect human traffickers raises alarm bells for Bacciarelli, who highlighted the possibility of automation bias. For example, air stewards are trained to spot signs of human trafficking; if they now rely on machines to flag potential traffickers, there’s a chance criminals could go undetected because they were given a green light by a machine.\nSecurity experts are also skeptical that the software can deliver on some of its promises. “If the intelligence community or law enforcement is already interested in a person, I think the AI targeting would be helpful, because you can find things in the system that you may have overlooked,” says John Harrison, an associate professor of counter terrorism at Rabdan University in Abu Dhabi. “But I don't know that you could necessarily predict that somebody is a terrorist or narcotics smuggler simply based on the fact that some algorithm says that these travel patterns dictate that.”\nDespite the risks posed by algorithm-driven profiling, the security sector is moving quickly to develop and install similar systems for every mode of transport: cars, buses, trains, and ships. Companies are following the lead of many of Europe’s governments. In a closed EU organized meeting on innovative technologies for border control in July 2023 in Warsaw, Poland, materials obtained under a freedom of information request reveal that the Dutch government referred to plans to scale up travel data exchange and targeting at borders in a powerpoint as a national “surveillance system [to] process passenger data to combat irregular residence or stay, linked to irregular migration,” while the Belgium government offers ideas for extending PNR to rail and bus lines.\nSITA now envisions a “multi-modal borders system” and advertises that its designers are working to integrate tracking passenger information sharing for planes, ferries, road and rail into the API PNR Gateway. A 2022 op-ed that ran in the Border Security Report by Manu Niinioja from WCC, advocated for more “national targeting centres” that track all transport modes and combine traveler booking data with visa applications and facial recognition at the port of entry. (The UK, the US, and others already have national targeting centers that centralize traveler and transport information.) The challenge of combining this data can be solved by “advanced commercially available software solutions,” writes Ninioja. For these companies, more opportunities to track where people are moving results in higher profits. For the traveler, they run the risk of being ensnared in an increasingly complex web of surveillance.\nIn mid-September, I met Linde for coffee in Berlin, where he told me that trying to unravel the real-world consequences of his watchlisting had become his life’s work. “I don’t know if I’m still actively surveilled,” Linde says. “I’m not surprised by anything anymore.”\nThis story was produced by Lighthouse Reports, Europe’s investigative newsroom.",

Linde, a Dutch citizen and human rights advocate, was returning home from outside the EU, and the immigration officer asked him a series of questions about his trip. Linde thought it was a random check; after a few minutes, he was cleared for entry. But unbeknownst to Linde, his answers were recorded and shared with a Dutch public prosecutor, who was collecting information on Linde’s movements.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The officer had been tipped off about Linde’s arrival that day through a seemingly innocuous action that occurs whenever you board a flight to the United States, much of Europe, and increasingly anywhere in the world—the exchange of detailed personal data about each traveler between airlines and governments.

The data, called a Passenger Name Record (PNR), is a digital trail of information related to an airline ticket purchase. PNR records are sent by most commercial airlines to the destination country some 48 to 72 hours before departure. While PNR records might seem innocuous, they contain highly sensitive personal information, including the traveler’s address, cell phone number, date of flight booking, where the ticket was purchased, credit card and other payment information, billing address, baggage information, frequent flyer information, general remarks related to the passenger, date of intended travel, complete travel itinerary, names of accompanying travelers, travel agency information, historical changes to the ticket, and more.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">In December 2022, over two years after Linde passed through Schiphol, the Dutch PNR office, called a Passenger Information Unit, handed over 17 travel records to Linde. They stated that they had not shared his data with others, but Linde was suspicious. He swiftly filed an appeal. In March 2023, the Dutch government admitted that in fact they had shared Linde’s PNR details three times with the border police, including ahead of the March 2020 flight, when the immigration officer was instructed to covertly extract information.

Learn more.\nThe original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nIn 2024, superconductivity—the flow of electric current with zero resistance—was discovered in three distinct materials. Two instances stretch the textbook understanding of the phenomenon. The third shreds it completely. “It’s an extremely unusual form of superconductivity that a lot of people would have said is not possible,” said Ashvin Vishwanath, a physicist at Harvard University who was not involved in the discoveries.\nEver since 1911, when the Dutch scientist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes first saw electrical resistance vanish, superconductivity has captivated physicists. There’s the pure mystery of how it happens: The phenomenon requires electrons, which carry electrical current, to pair up. Electrons repel each other, so how can they be united?\nThen there’s the technological promise: Already, superconductivity has enabled the development of MRI machines and powerful particle colliders. If physicists could fully understand how and when the phenomenon arises, perhaps they could engineer a wire that superconducts electricity under everyday conditions rather than exclusively at low temperatures, as is currently the case. World-altering technologies—lossless power grids, magnetically levitating vehicles—might follow.\nThe recent spate of discoveries has both compounded the mystery of superconductivity and heightened the optimism. “It seems to be, in materials, that superconductivity is everywhere,” said Matthew Yankowitz, a physicist at the University of Washington.\nThe discoveries stem from a recent revolution in materials science: All three new instances of superconductivity arise in devices assembled from flat sheets of atoms. These materials display unprecedented flexibility; at the touch of a button, physicists can switch them between conducting, insulating, and more exotic behaviors—a modern form of alchemy that has supercharged the hunt for superconductivity.\nIt now seems increasingly likely that diverse causes can give rise to the phenomenon. Just as birds, bees and dragonflies all fly using different wing structures, materials seem to pair electrons together in different ways. Even as researchers debate exactly what’s happening in the various two-dimensional materials in question, they anticipate that the growing zoo of superconductors will help them achieve a more universal view of the alluring phenomenon.\nPairing Electrons\nThe case of Kamerlingh Onnes’ observations (and superconductivity seen in other extremely cold metals) was finally cracked in 1957. John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer figured out that at low temperatures, a material’s jittery atomic lattice quiets down, so more delicate effects come through. Electrons gently tug on protons in the lattice, drawing them inward to create an excess of positive charge. That deformation, known as a phonon, can then draw in a second electron, forming a “Cooper pair.” Cooper pairs can all come together into a coherent quantum entity in a way that lone elections can’t. The resulting quantum soup slips frictionlessly in between the material’s atoms, which normally impede electric flow.\nBardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer’s theory of phonon-based superconductivity earned them the physics Nobel Prize in 1972. But it turned out not to be the whole story. In the 1980s, physicists found that copper-filled crystals called cuprates could superconduct at higher temperatures, where atomic jiggles wash out phonons. Other similar examples followed.\nTheorists brainstormed new ways of pairing electrons.\nThe higher-temperature superconductors seemed to have atoms arranged in a way that slows electrons down. And when electrons get the chance to mingle in a leisurely fashion, they collectively generate an ornate electric field that can make them do novel things, like form pairs rather than repel. Physicists now suspect that in cuprates, specifically, electrons hop between atoms in a particular way that favors pairing. But other “unconventional” superconductors are still quite mysterious.\nThen, in 2018, a new superconductor opened physicists’ eyes wider.\nPablo Jarillo-Herrero, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that if you took a sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice—a 2D crystal called graphene—twisted it at precisely 1.1 degrees, and stacked it on top of another graphene sheet, the two layers could superconduct.\nResearchers had already been dabbling with 2D materials and finding diverse behaviors. By applying electric fields, they could add electrons to the sheet or make the electrons feel almost as if the atomic grid were contracting. Twiddling these settings in a single 2D device could reproduce the behavior of thousands to millions of potential materials. Among those heaps of possibilities, Jarillo-Herrero had shown, was a new superconductor: “magic angle” graphene.\nThen, a couple of years later, a group in California removed the magic angle, finding that three-layer, twist-free graphene devices could also superconduct.\nResearchers are still discussing why electrons stick together in these cases. Phonons fit the data in some ways, but something new also seems responsible.\nBut what really thrilled physicists was the promise of a fresh way to investigate superconductivity in general. The customizable 2D devices had freed them from the drudgery of designing, growing, and testing new crystals one by one. Researchers would now be able to quickly re-create the effects of many different atomic lattices in a single device and find out exactly what electrons are capable of.\nThe research strategy is now paying off. This year, physicists found the first instances of superconductivity in 2D materials other than graphene, along with a completely novel form of superconductivity in a new graphene system. The discoveries have established that the earlier graphene superconductors mark just the outskirts of a wild new jungle.\nA Hint Vindicated\nIn 2020, the physicist Cory Dean and his team at Columbia University tried stacking sheets of a different 2D crystal—this one, a honeycomb arrangement of two types of atoms, called a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). When they twisted the sheets at 5 degrees, the resistance plunged toward zero but didn’t stay there. It was an inconclusive hint of superconductivity.\nThe tentative nature of the detection didn’t stop Liang Fu of MIT and Constantin Schrade of Louisiana State University from trying to explain it. They suspected that phonons weren’t the answer. Twisted materials are powerful because the twist changes what the electrons experience, imbuing the material with a kaleidoscopic “moiré” pattern. The moiré features large hexagonal cells that act like artificial atoms, hosting electrons. In this new environment, electrons move slowly enough for their collective electrical interactions to guide their behavior.\nBut how were the electrons conspiring to form pairs? The Columbia group funneled electrons into the moiré. They observed that when there was one electron for each of the large cells in the moiré material, these electrons assumed an “antiferromagnetic” arrangement; their intrinsic magnetic fields tended to alternate between pointing up and down. Adding extra electrons to the moiré made the resistance drop to zero—Cooper pairs had formed. Fu and Schrade argued that the same electron-on-electron action was making both the antiferromagnetic state and the superconducting state possible. At one electron per cell, each electron can have a preferred location and magnetic orientation. But when additional electrons pile in, the magnetic arrangement becomes unstable, and the whole population starts to flow freely.\nScientific journals initially rejected Fu and Schrade’s paper describing these ideas because there wasn’t any hard evidence that TMDs can superconduct. Now there is. The Columbia group spent the last four years improving their ability to measure electrical resistance at low temperatures, and earlier this year they had a breakthrough. They assembled another two-sheet device with a 5-degree twist, cooled it down, and watched it superconduct—an observation soon to be published in Nature. “Lo and behold, we see that the state that we thought existed is appearing in exactly the right place,” Dean said. “It’s a little bit of vindication.”\nFu and Schrade’s theory—bolstered by the Columbia confirmation—has now been published, but it isn’t proved. One way to test it is to check whether the Cooper pairs can rotate, as the theory predicts. That’s an unusual feature, as electrons paired by phonons don’t orbit each other.\nAdding electrons to an antiferromagnetic metal isn’t the only way to cook up superconductivity in TMDs. Shortly before the Columbia discovery, another group found an even more peculiar species of superconductivity in the very same material.\nJie Shan and Kin Fai Mak, an academic power couple who run a lab at Cornell University, had been searching for superconductivity in TMDs since Jarillo-Herrero’s blockbuster twisted-graphene discovery in 2018. They spent years mixing and matching five kinds of TMD crystals, trying out different twist angles and temperatures, and applying various electric-field strengths to the material—searching a massive haystack for a superconducting device.\nWhen the needle finally appeared, it displayed a species of superconductivity that no one had seen coming. The Columbia team had started with an antiferromagnetic metal and added electrons. The Cornell group, however, started with an insulator and added nothing. Their moiré pattern—which resulted from a milder 3.5-degree twist—allowed electrons to slow down so much and interact so strongly that they all got stuck in place at precisely one electron per cell.\nThen the group made the device superconduct just by tweaking the strength of the applied electric field. That result, which the researchers reported in Nature in October, doesn’t neatly fit any popular theory of superconductivity.\n“It really smells like something else is going on,” Vishwanath said.\nThe Most Exotic Beast Yet\nEven as superconductivity has spread to the TMDs, graphene continues to astonish. Over the summer, a graphene device produced a mythical form of superconductivity.\n“It is phenomenologically different from all other superconductors,” said Long Ju of MIT, leader of the group that found it. And that’s “comparing it to any superconductor that has been discovered since Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911.”\nTwisting is too messy for Ju’s tastes; the moiré patterns tend to get disrupted by wrinkles in the sheets that make every device a little different. Instead, he studies a staircase-like arrangement of four graphene layers that can also slow electrons down. The challenge is to spot which graphene flakes naturally have this staircase arrangement—something Ju accomplishes with the aid of an infrared camera. “You don’t need to pick up four different layers and stack them,” Ju said. “Nature does it for you. You just need to have the right pair of eyes to see them.”\nLast year, Ju’s group made a splash when they placed a five-layer graphene flake on an insulator at a twisted angle and observed a rare electron behavior that normally requires a strong magnetic field to induce. Theorists questioned whether the twist was essential, so he and his team went back to see what would happen when they took the twist out. “We found something that was more bizarre,” Ju said.\nAs they changed the strength of the electric field that they applied to the material, they found several settings where resistance vanished. In two cases, the superconductivity flickered, with resistance coming and going. Strangely, when they switched on a nearby magnet, the flickering stopped. Magnets normally kill superconductivity, but here, they strengthened it. “This existed only in the imagination of theorists,” Ju said.\nJu’s group suspects that their graphene staircases are creating the conditions for electrons to pair up and rotate. But they think that in their graphene devices, all pairs tend to rotate in the same direction—either clockwise or counterclockwise—and flickers appear when pairs aren’t all rotating uniformly. The magnetic field stamps out the flickers by pushing any wayward pairs to align with the overall gyre. A material with such a preferred internal direction is called “chiral,” but chirality has long been thought to preclude superconductivity, since it distinguishes leftward- and rightward-moving electrons in a way that should stop pairs from forming.\n“People thought you would not get superconductivity in this setting,” Vishwanath said. “It really calls for something entirely new.”\nIn fact, it’s so unusual that other researchers are waiting for more experiments to verify it. “It’s probably still an evolving story,” Mak said. “It just needs additional data to fully confirm whether it’s a chiral superconductor or not.”\nTheorists, meanwhile, have published new theories of how chiral superconductivity might happen. Fu and collaborators proposed the following recipe in September: You start with electrons arranged to form a repeating crystal—like in an insulator, except in this case the electron grid is free to float independently of the background atomic nuclei. Then the electron grid relaxes, and its ripples pair electrons the way phonons do. Fu stressed that this is just one possibility, noting, “We’re in uncharted territory.”\nA True Understanding\nWhile physicists can’t say for sure what’s pairing electrons in these 2D materials, they feel more confident that there are multiple ways to do it. Electrons organize into all sorts of materials, from insulators to magnetic metals to electronic crystals, and slight disturbances seem poised to tip many of these materials into superconducting electron pairs.\nBeing able to directly see what happens when they add more electrons to a material or slightly weaken its electric field lets physicists quickly try out an unprecedented number of recipes and see which ones lead to superconductivity.\n“The real promise,” Dean said, is that each of these devices is “a tunable lab in which we can make basically any other material.”\nThe experimentalists are amassing a treasure trove of data for theorists to explain. Mak and Shan hope that this abundance will let theorists predict ways to create superconductivity that experiments can confirm. That would demonstrate a true understanding of the phenomenon, which would mark both an academic achievement and a key step toward designing materials for revolutionary new technologies.\nBut for now, experimentalists are still the ones leading the way. “Everyone’s rushing as fast as they can,” Yankowitz said. “I can’t believe that we’re six years in and you can’t take a break.”\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

These materials display unprecedented flexibility; at the touch of a button, physicists can switch them between conducting, insulating, and more exotic behaviors—a modern form of alchemy that has supercharged the hunt for superconductivity.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It now seems increasingly likely that diverse causes can give rise to the phenomenon. Just as birds, bees and dragonflies all fly using different wing structures, materials seem to pair electrons together in different ways. Even as researchers debate exactly what’s happening in the various two-dimensional materials in question, they anticipate that the growing zoo of superconductors will help them achieve a more universal view of the alluring phenomenon.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Pairing Electrons</h2><p class=\"paywall\">The case of Kamerlingh Onnes’ observations (and superconductivity seen in other extremely cold metals) was finally cracked in 1957. John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.108.1175\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.108.1175\" href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.108.1175\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">figured out</a> that at low temperatures, a material’s jittery atomic lattice quiets down, so more delicate effects come through. Electrons gently tug on protons in the lattice, drawing them inward to create an excess of positive charge. That deformation, known as a phonon, can then draw in a second electron, forming a “Cooper pair.” Cooper pairs can all come together into a coherent quantum entity in a way that lone elections can’t. The resulting quantum soup slips frictionlessly in between the material’s atoms, which normally impede electric flow.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer’s theory of phonon-based superconductivity earned them the physics Nobel Prize in 1972. But it turned out not to be the whole story. In the 1980s, physicists found that copper-filled crystals called cuprates could superconduct at higher temperatures, where atomic jiggles wash out phonons. Other similar examples followed.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "It was 2016, and the problem of fake news kept Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (then called Facebook), up at night. The young entrepreneur was under pressure from the media and was also constantly questioned by the US legal system. The Cambridge Analytica case, accusations of Russian interference in the elections, and Donald Trump's victory in the presidential race raised serious concerns. For the first time, the question of the platform's influence on the political landscape was being addressed—US lawmakers demanded that the company “protect democracy.” Eventually, Zuckerberg would appear before the Senate in 2018.\nAs part of his counteroffensive, the company created the Third Party Fact-Checkers, or Independent Fact-Checkers, program to address misinformation on its platforms.\nThe History of Independent Fact-Checkers at Facebook\nFirst implemented in the United States and then in the rest of the world, the project seemed to be working. So far, according to its own data, there were more than 100 international organizations actively participating in it. Indeed, last year, in the context of the European Union parliamentary elections, Meta announced the effectiveness of its labeling system: “Between July and December 2023, for example, nearly 68 million posts on Facebook and Instagram had fact-checking labels. When something was labeled as false or misleading, 95 percent of people did not click on the content.”\nBut everything changed on January 7, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the end of the program in the United States. It seems only a matter of time before the initiative disappears in Latin America and the rest of the world, undermining independent news organizations that depend, to a greater or lesser extent, on that funding. Among those who would be affected will be Animal Político in Mexico; Chequeado in Argentina; Agencia Lupa or Aos Fatos in Brazil; and Maldita.es in Spain. Why get rid of something that was working, according to the company itself?\nHow Does Meta’s Third-Party Fact-Checker Program Work?\nI was an editorial supervisor at Animal Político’s El Sabueso when Meta approached us to start the project. To be part of it, you had to join the Poynter Institute certification, an international organization funded by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), which set the editorial rules for verifying information with a highly rigorous and transparent code of principles. Meta trusted this network for the project, and also had its own requirements. Among them: Political discourse or any type of content that was classified as an opinion could not be refuted. Statements by Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) could not be questioned, for example, but misinformation about the first migrant caravan, which crossed Mexico in the first year of AMLO’s six-year presidential term (2018) and which strengthened a racist anti-immigrant discourse, could be.\nThe “news” that was being debunked was photos or videos taken out of context, such as one that falsely claimed that a group of migrants had hijacked a truck in Chiapas. There were also lies about alleged kidnappings of children in Mexico and other Latin American countries. Then came the Covid-19 pandemic. Independent fact-checkers took on a leading role in debunking, with the available data, ideas such as “drinking bleach eliminates the virus” or “5G networks caused the pandemic.”\nFact-checking outlets would argue that something was false, and then Facebook’s tool would not remove the original content but would instead add a label such as “False: Verified by Animal Político” or another one of the network’s organizations. Meta claimed that once a post received the label, its reach was drastically reduced. “We know that this program is working and that users find value in the labels after a fact-checker rates them,” reads an official Meta post. Zuckerberg’s company always said that it would not be an “arbitrator of truth;” that was why it did not delete the original posts, showing confidence in the IFCN organizations that did this work.\nThis 180-degree change is a response to Donald Trump's imminent second presidential term and to the methods of the competition, such as X's Community Notes. Meta decided not to invest any more money in its program. Now, it hopes that Facebook and Instagram users themselves will be the ones to decide what content is disinformation or not.\nIn the statement where Zuckerberg announced that he will dismantle the program, he said that fact-checkers succumbed to political bias, destroying more trust than they'd created in the US. However, for Laura Zommer, former director of Chequeado (one of the most important Spanish-speaking verifier organizations) and LatamChequea, and now leader of Factchequeado (a verification media aimed at the Latino community in the US), Zuckerberg's statements are not a surprise, and he does not have scientific evidence for his claims. “Far from censoring, fact-checkers add context,\" Zommer says. “We never advocate for removing content. We want citizens to have better information to make their own decisions.”\nZommer, who is skeptical of how the dissolution of this program might benefit Meta, emphasizes that the company contradicts itself by ending the fact-checking program, especially because it has highlighted its positive results in the past. Zommer also agrees with Angie Drobnic Holan, current director of IFCN, who, in a LinkedIn post, wrote: \"It’s unfortunate that this decision comes in the wake of extreme political pressure from a new administration and its supporters. Fact-checkers have not been biased in their work—that attack line comes from those who feel they should be able to exaggerate and lie without rebuttal or contradiction.\"\nAs Trump, just days away from his inauguration, threatens a mass deportation of migrants, the Hispanic community is facing a possible new wave of disinformation. \"The evidence makes us think this will be bad. Until it is implemented we will see, but we can say that, during the Trump campaign, one of the main disinformation narratives was against migrants, such as those that said migrants would commit fraud. That was false. The data from the past makes us think that this decision is likely to negatively affect Latino communities in the US,\" Zommer tells WIRED en Español.\nAnti-immigrant rhetoric is not the only thing endangering the ecosystem. In an age where deepfake video and audio scams are spreading, having viable information will be a priority.\nThe Latin American news ecosystem, with its economic vulnerability, is at risk. \"Facebook's fact-checker program payments were still keeping fact-checking organizations and news organizations with a fact-checking section afloat. So I think that, most likely, if these organizations don't manage to diversify soon, many of them are going to disappear,\" says Pablo Medina, disinformation research editor at the Latin American Center for Investigative Journalism, CLIP.\nWhile the decision applies only to the US for now, the disappearance of the project has raised alarm in the Hispanic media ecosystem. “The attack expressed by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on what he called ‘secret courts’ that promote censorship of the platform in Latin America—a false claim—indicates that Brazil is a key focus of the company’s concerns,” says Tai Nalon, CEO of Aos Fatos, one of the most important fact-checking media in the global south.\n“This is completely in line with the rhetoric of Donald Trump, a regular detractor of journalism and fact-checking,\" Nalon says. \"The arguments used by Zuckerberg have been widely exploited by the far right around the world to delegitimize effective initiatives against disinformation. Since there has never been dissatisfaction with the work of fact-checkers before, this seems to me to be a move aimed at gaining some political advantage. We know that Meta is facing antitrust cases in the US, and being close to the government could be an advantage for the company.”\nMeanwhile, as Laura Zommer says, evidence from the past gives the news ecosystem reason to worry.\nWIRED en español contacted Meta for this story. Through a media representative, the company replied with the statement (in Spanish) of the decision and said that this does not apply to WhatsApp and is only for US verifiers.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "content_text": "It has been more than a week since reports first emerged about a “glowing ring of metal” that fell from the sky and crashed near a remote village in Kenya.\nAccording to the Kenya Space Agency, the object weighed 1,100 pounds and had a diameter of more than 8 feet when measured after it landed on December 30. A couple of days later, the space agency confidently reported that the object was a piece of space debris, saying it was a ring that separated from a rocket. \"Such objects are usually designed to burn up as they reenter the Earth’s atmosphere or to fall over unoccupied areas, such as the oceans,\" the space agency told The New York Times.\nSince those initial reports were published in Western media, a small band of dedicated space trackers have been using open source data to try to identify precisely which space object fell into Kenya. So far, they have not been able to identify the rocket launch to which the large ring can be attributed.\nNow, some space trackers believe the object may not have come from space at all.\nDid It Really Come From Space?\nSpace is increasingly crowded, but large chunks of metal from rockets are generally not flying around in Earth orbit undetected and untracked.\n\"It was suggested that the ring is space debris, but the evidence is marginal,\" wrote Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist working at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. McDowell is highly regarded for his analysis of space objects. “The most likely space-related possibility is the reentry of the SYLDA adapter from the Ariane V184 flight, object 33155. Nevertheless, I am not fully convinced that the ring is space debris at all,” he wrote.\nAnother prominent space tracker, Marco Langbroek, believes it's plausible that the ring came from space, so he investigated further into objects that may have returned around the time of the object's discovery in Kenya. In a blog post written Wednesday he noted that apart from the metal ring, other fragments looking consistent with space debris—including material that looks like carbon wrap and isolation foil—were found several kilometers away from the ring.\nLike McDowell, Langbroek concluded that the most likely source for the object was an Ariane V launch that took place back in July 2008, in which the European rocket lofted two satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbit.\nThe Ariane V rocket was a rather unique rocket in that it was designed with the capacity to launch two medium-sized satellites into geostationary transfer orbit, a destination much more popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s than it is today. To accommodate both satellites, a SYstème de Lancement Double Ariane (SYLDA) shell was placed over the lower satellite to support the mounting of a second satellite on top of it. During the launch in 2008, this SYLDA shell was ejected into a 1.6-degree inclined geosynchronous transfer orbit, Langbroek said.\nCould It Have Come From a European Rocket?\nOver the years, this object has been tracked by the US military, which maintains a database of space objects so that active spacecraft can avoid collisions. Due to a lack of tracking stations near the equator, this object is only periodically observed. According to Langbroek, its last observation took place on December 23, when it was in a highly elliptical orbit, reaching a perigee of just 90 miles (146 km) from the Earth. This was a week before an object crashed into Kenya.\nBased on his modeling of the possible reentry of the SYLDA shell, Langbroek believes it's possible that the European object could have landed in Kenya around the time its entry was observed.\nHowever, an anonymous X account using the handle DutchSpace, which despite the anonymity has provided reliable information about Ariane launch vehicles in the past, posted a thread that indicates this ring could not have been part of the SYLDA shell. With images and documentation, it seems clear that neither the diameter nor mass of the SYLDA component matches the ring found in Kenya.\nAdditionally, Arianespace officials told Le Parisien newspaper on Thursday that they do not believe the space debris was associated with the Ariane V rocket. Essentially, if the ring does not fit, you must acquit.\nSo what was it?\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

He put Southern California’s dryness into perspective using charts and maps.\nHow Dry Is Southern California Right Now?\nIn early January, the soil moisture in much of Southern California was in the bottom 2 percent of historical records for that day in the region. That’s extremely low.\nHydrologists in California watch the sky very closely starting in October, when California’s water year begins.\nThe state gets very little rain from May through September, so late fall and winter are crucial to fill reservoirs and to build up the snowpack to provide water. California relies on the Sierra snowpack for about one-third of its freshwater supply.\nHowever, Southern California started out the 2024–25 water year pretty dry. The region got some rain from an atmospheric river in November, but not much. After that, most of the atmospheric rivers that hit the West Coast from October into January veered northward into Washington, Oregon, and Northern California.\nWhen the air is warm and dry, transpiration and evaporation also suck water out of the plants and soil. That leaves dry vegetation that can provide fuel for flying embers to spread wildfires, as the Los Angeles area saw in early January.\nSo, while Northern California’s water and snowpack conditions are in good shape, Southern California is much drier, and its water storage is not doing so well.\nThe Southern Sierra snowpack was starting to dip below normal in early January.\nWhat Can California Expect for the Rest of 2025?\nThe US Climate Prediction Center’s seasonal outlook through March suggests that drought is likely to develop in the region in the coming months.\nThe outlook takes into account forecasts for La Niña, an ocean temperature pattern that was on its way to developing in the Pacific Ocean in early 2025. La Niña tends to mean drier conditions in Southern California. However, not every La Niña affects California in the same way.\nOne or two big rain events could completely turn the table for Southern California’s water situation. In 2023, California saw atmospheric rivers in April.\nSo, it’s hard to say this early in the season how dry Southern California will be in the coming months, but it’s clear that people in dry areas need to pay attention to the risks.",

    "content_text": "Devastating wildfires continued to burn throughout the Los Angeles metro area on Friday, extending mandatory evacuations and school closures across the region. Next week promises little chance of relief; conditions will remain favorable for both the growth of existing wildfires and for new blazes to spark, as gusty winds persist amid unusually dry conditions.\nOfficials reported five major blazes across the Los Angeles area as of Friday morning. The Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades and Malibu has consumed more than 20,000 acres, while the Eaton Fire in Altadena has grown to more than 10,000 acres. At least 10,000 structures are thought to have been destroyed across Los Angeles, and 10 people have been killed.\nFavorable fire weather requires dry vegetation, low humidity, and stiff winds. The combination of these ingredients allows fires to easily spark and rapidly spread; it was this dangerous mix that allowed the Palisades Fire and Eaton Fire to expand beyond any crew’s ability to control them earlier in the week.\nFire crews have since managed to start controlling the fires, helped by out-of-state reinforcements, the water in hydrants being replenished, and wind speeds dropping. (As well as helping the fires spread rapidly, the high seasonal Santa Ana winds earlier in the week at times prevented firefighting aircraft from working to control the blazes with water and fire-retardant chemicals.) The bad news is that those winds may now be about to pick up again—and that on all other fronts, conditions aren’t likely to be in firefighters’ favor anytime soon.\nWhat Happens Next With the Weather\nThe Storm Prediction Center, the agency of the National Weather Service tasked with issuing fire weather outlooks, says that the risk for fire conditions will remain elevated across Los Angeles heading into this weekend.\nWe could see two more moderate Santa Ana wind events in the coming days—one early in the day on Sunday, and another possibly on Tuesday. These gusts could encourage the spread of existing fires and the ignition of additional blazes.\nA Santa Ana wind event occurs when there’s a pressure difference between the Great Basin—the vast stretch of land in Nevada and Utah—and coastal communities around Los Angeles.\nMeteorologists often use the air pressure differential between Las Vegas and Los Angeles to predict these winds. A stronger pressure difference creates stronger winds that rush toward the coast, which feeds existing wildfires. This is what they are predicting we could see again in the coming days.\nVegetation will also continue to be exceptionally dry across the region. It’s the middle of southern California’s rainy season right now—yet the rain is nowhere to be found. After seeing its third-wettest February on record last year, Los Angeles International Airport has reported only 0.03 inches of rain since the start of last summer.\nDespite the middle of January being prime time for Los Angeles’ rainy season, there’s very little hope for meaningful rain over the next week and a half. NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center announced Thursday that we’ve officially entered La Niña, a pattern of colder-than-normal water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean around the equator. Changes in the atmosphere responding to La Niña can force the jet stream to move northward over the Eastern Pacific Ocean, which shunts storms into Canada’s West Coast instead of the western US, starving states like California of rain.\nRight on cue, the predominant storm track across the Pacific Ocean will remain up near the Gulf of Alaska through the middle of January, providing few opportunities for rain to make it as far south as Southern California.\nForecasters expect a weak La Niña to stick around through the end of winter, with decent odds that the pattern will fade in time for spring. Unfortunately, this timing could coincide with the onset of Southern California’s dry season.\nThat’s not to say we may not see opportunities for rain in the coming months. However, little to no rain through at least the middle of January will keep vegetation exceptionally dry throughout the region. The ongoing risk for new fires and additional fire growth will hinge on bouts of low humidity with gusty winds—and any additional Santa Ana wind events could prove dangerous in the coming weeks.",

On the same day, we will also see it at its closest point to Earth, and it could become 2025’s brightest comet, during a year in which no other comets are likely to be visible to the naked eye. Here’s everything you need to know.\nC/2024 G3 was discovered on April 5, 2024, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas)—a network of telescopes that scans space for asteroids that could potentially hit Earth. The comet comes from the Oort Cloud, a remote region at the outer edge of the solar system that is believed to contain the remnants of the materials that formed the solar systems’s planets.\nWhen comet C/2024 G3 reaches perihelion, it will come within just 13.5 million kilometers of the sun—for context, Mercury, the planet closest to the sun, orbits the star at a distance of 47 million kilometers. According to the latest calculations reported by the Planetary Society, C/2024 G3 could reach a brightness of magnitude –4.5, which is about the same as Venus, and is likely to be visible to the naked eye for people located in the southern hemisphere.\nThe comet’s unusually close journey to the sun, however, raises questions about whether it will survive. Its orbital path suggests that it is a dynamically old comet, and that this isn’t its first trip around the sun. In fact, its last approach is estimated to have been about 160,000 years ago, which means it may have already survived a close pass. “It will be very heated and may not survive,” says Nick James, director of the comet section of the British Astronomical Association. “But if it does, it could be an impressive object in the evening sky from the southern hemisphere after perihelion.”\nHow to Observe the Comet\nShould it survive unscathed, the comet will be visible in the southern hemisphere to the west just after sunset on January 13. The comet’s orbital configuration makes it difficult to observe for those in the northern hemisphere—it will appear very low in the sky just after sunset or before sunrise, but is likely to be drowned out by twilight.\nThe comet’s proximity to the sun means that identifying it could be dangerous, and James says that C/2024 G3 “should only be observed if you are an experienced observer.” Looking directly at the sun without protective equipment can cause permanent eye damage.\nThere will also be interference from the light of the moon, which will be in its waning phases, which could make observation more difficult. Observing the comet with the naked eye in the southern hemisphere might be possible, but binoculars or a telescope might be needed.\nThose who do not want to miss the show can follow the comet in images from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory’s Lasco C3 coronagraph, or consult the IAU Minor Planet Center or the Comet OBServation (COBS) database.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED Italia and has been translated from Italian.",

The field is small but growing, reflecting recent studies that suggest the frequency of extreme fires has more than doubled since 2023. The growth has been led by terrible fires in the western United States, Canada, and Russia.\n“Definitely the interest [in evacuation research] has increased due to the frequency of wildfire burns,” says Asad Ali, an engineering doctoral student at the North Dakota State University whose work has focused on the field. “We’re seeing more publications, more articles.”\nWhen evacuations go wrong, they really go wrong. In LA’s Pacific Palisades neighborhood, panicked drivers stuck in traffic abandoned their vehicles in the middle of evacuation routes, leaving emergency crews unable to reach the fires. Authorities used bulldozers to push empty cars out of the way.\nTo prevent this sort of chaos, researchers are attempting to answer some basic but critical questions: Who reacts to what kind of warnings? And when are people most likely to get out of harm’s way?\nMany of researchers’ ideas about evacuations come from other sorts of disasters—from studies of residents’ reactions to floods, nuclear disasters, or volcanic eruptions, and especially hurricanes.\nBut hurricanes and wildfires differ in some obvious, and less obvious, ways. Hurricanes are usually bigger and affect whole regions, which can require many states and agencies to work together to help people travel longer distances. But hurricanes are also relatively predictable and slow-moving, and tend to give authorities much more time to organize escapes and to strategize about phased evacuations, so that everyone doesn't hit the road at once. Wildfires are less predictable and require rapid communications.\nPeople’s decisions to go or stay are also affected by an inconvenient fact: The residents who stay during hurricanes can’t do much to prevent disaster. But for those who stay in the midst of wildfires to defend their homes with hoses or water, the gambit sometimes works. “Psychologically, wildfire evacuation is very difficult,“ says Asad.\nThe research thus far suggests that reactions to wildfires, and whether people choose to stay, go, or just wait around for a while, can be determined by a bunch of things: whether residents have been through wildfire warnings before, and whether those warnings were followed by actual threats; how the emergency is being communicated to them; and how the neighbors around them react.\nOne survey of some 500 California wildfire evacuees conducted in 2017 and 2018 found that some longtime residents who have experienced lots of previous wildfire incidents are less likely to evacuate—but others did exactly the opposite. Overall, lower-income people were less likely to flee, possibly because of limited access to transportation or places to stay. These sorts of surveys can be used by authorities to create models that tell them when to instruct which people to evacuate.\nOne difficulty in wildfire evacuation research right now is that researchers don’t necessarily class wildfire events in the “extreme weather” category, says Kendra K. Levine, the library director at the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Berkeley. Southern California’s Santa Ana winds, for example, aren’t unusual. They happen every year. But combine the winds with the region’s historic—and likely climate-change-related—dryness, and the wildfires start to look more like weather. “People are starting to come to terms” with the relationship, Levine says, which has led to more interest and scholarship among those who specialize in extreme weather.\nAsad, the North Dakota researcher, says he’s already had meetings about using data collected during this week’s disasters in future research. It’s a faint silver lining, that the horror Californians experienced this week might produce important findings that will help others avoid the worst in the future.",

    "content_text": "The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a landmark First Amendment case on Friday that will determine the fate of TikTok in the United States. For more than two hours, the nine justices questioned lawyers for TikTok, content creators, and the US government about a law passed last year that, if left to stand, could result in a ban of the popular video-sharing app on January 19.\nSpeaking with WIRED, experts said it was unlikely that the court would side with TikTok and block the ban from going into effect. While the justices were concerned over the First Amendment implications of the law, they appeared convinced that the app poses a substantial risk to US national security.\nTikTok’s lawyer, Noel Francisco, and Jeffrey Fisher, who represents the creators, argued that, as written, the law banning TikTok violates the rights their clients have to free expression; removing access to the TikTok algorithm, they claim, would remove a speech outlet for creators and the company itself. For the government, solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar argued that the law does not censor the defendants, but quarantines the app from parent company ByteDance and Chinese influence.\n“I don't think [the law] reflects Congress seeking to set out in advance what kind of speech we should have reflecting certain views on certain topics,” Prelogar said. “Instead, it's about trying to close off the vulnerability that our foreign adversary nation could exploit.”\n“This case boils down to speech. What we're talking about is ideas,” Francisco said in his rebuttal, dismissing national security concerns that the TikTok algorithm could be used to manipulate Americans. “That whole notion is at war with the First Amendment. If the First Amendment means anything, it means that the government cannot restrict speech, in order to protect us from the speech. That's precisely what this law does from beginning to end.”\nWhile many of the justices voiced concern over the law’s First Amendment threats, they also appeared amenable to the government’s argument that the law was more targeted toward severing TikTok’s connections with ByteDance than limiting its free-speech rights.\nFor more than five years, US officials have warned that TikTok has the potential to influence American perception of the Chinese government. In public interviews and congressional hearings, officials like FBI director Christopher Wray have also suggested that TikTok gathers US user data that the Chinese government could weaponize to surveil Americans online. TikTok has denied that it shares any US data with ByteDance or the Chinese government.\nDonald Trump was the first to try banning TikTok in 2020, when he issued an executive order that quickly got held up in litigation throughout the remainder of his presidency. Upon taking office, President Joe Biden rescinded the order and began negotiating with TikTok to reach a deal designed to satisfy the government’s national security concerns while allowing TikTok to continue operating, an effort that became known as Project Texas. When no deal could be reached, Congress responded by approving the ban-or-sell bill, titled the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, setting the January 19 deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok to a suitable buyer or be removed from US app stores. The law allows for Biden to extend that deadline an additional 90 days.\nSoon after Biden signed the bill to ban TikTok in April, the company and a consortium of its users retaliated by filing lawsuits accusing the federal government of violating their First Amendment rights. In December, a federal appeals court upheld the ban law, leaving TikTok with only one legal pathway left to save itself: an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nMany of these same arguments were made at Friday’s hearing. Justice Brett Kavanaugh called the government’s data security rationale “strong.” Justices Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch called into question the government’s assertion that the app could host “covert” Chinese manipulation operations, arguing that TikTok’s algorithm was just as opaque as those belonging to other social media companies.\n“We all now know that China is behind it,” Kagan said.\nFisher, who represents the creators involved in the case, argued that the justices did not have to answer questions related to security, which would be better resolved by broader data privacy legislation.\n“If Congress, in this very law, regulated data security in other ways with the data brokers, that's perfectly permissible,” Fisher told the court. “But the question before you today was narrower. The question is, is this law before you sustainable on security grounds? And that answer has to be no,” Fisher told the court.\nJustices expressed some doubt as to whether the law actually limits TikTok’s freedom of expression, given the option to divest. “TikTok can continue to operate on its own algorithm on its own terms, as long as it's not associated with ByteDance,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said.\nIf the ban goes into effect, Apple and Google would be required to remove TikTok from the US versions of their app stores, preventing any new downloads from happening in the country. Internet hosting and data storage providers will also be forbidden from offering their services to the company. Users with TikTok already downloaded onto their devices may still continue to have access, at least for a short period of time after the ban goes into effect. Once removed from app stores, users won’t be able to download updates to TikTok, and the app could become more buggy and difficult to use over time. TikTok’s lawyer told the justices that the app would go dark after January 19.\nBlake Reid, a tech law professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said that the justices seemed to target TikTok’s corporate structure, leaving the app’s counsel little time to argue the merits of the data security argument. “I'm not sure that Tiktok will lose that argument, but because they spent so much time on it, they didn't get to make the arguments about the national security stuff and the privacy and security stuff, which I think is the weakest part of the government's case.”\nThe justices seemed more sympathetic to the government’s security concerns, says Alan Rozenshtein, a law professor and former national security adviser to the Justice Department. “It's very plausible that Tiktok picks up a couple of votes,” Rozenshtein says. “I think the three most likely are justices Sotomayor, Gorsuch, and maybe Kagan, but I struggle to see TikTok getting five votes, which is what it needs to strike down this law.”\nIn a press conference following the hearing on Friday, Francisco said the argument went “really well” and that the justices “vigorously questioned both sides.”\nIt’s unclear when the court would issue its decision, but Rozenshtein and Reid believe it will come sooner rather than later. TikTok’s lawyer, Francisco, suggested that the justices could issue a stay or an injunction to stop the ban from going into effect as scheduled, but they gave no signals as to whether they would consider it.\nTrump also pleaded with the nation’s highest court to stop the ban from going into effect in an amicus brief filed last month, promising to find a “political” solution to save TikTok once he retakes power. “President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing national security concerns,” Trump lawyer D. John Sauer wrote in the filing. The court has not yet responded to the brief.\nIf the justices uphold the ban, a deal with Trump might just be TikTok’s last shot at survival.",

    "content_text": "Lavelle Dunn never dreamed of being on screen. In 2019, he moved from Chicago to Los Angeles with plans of working behind the scenes in Hollywood. He made connections at networking events. He tried his hand at screenwriting. “I never accepted that I could be successful in front of the camera, and vulnerably so,” he says. But success quickly followed in 2021 when Dunn—like many people in need of an outlet during the first years of the pandemic—joined TikTok. In a post from that May, he reviewed watermelon jerky from Trader Joe’s. “I’m gonna give it a gah boom bam,” he says enthusiastically in the video, which netted 1 million views overnight (it was a hot-button snack, as it turns out). That’s the moment Dunn knew: TikTok was the key.\nAs @TheLavelleShow, Dunn specializes in lifestyle content—“tips and tricks that ultimately center around my life”—that now reaches some 730,000 people. In the last year he’s cashed in on brand partnerships with Whole Foods, Marriott, Taco Bell, and The Cheesecake Factory. He made “well over six figures” in 2024, he says—Dunn declined to share the exact amount—and was able to quit his full-time job as a hotel concierge. “It took me time to even accept like that’s what I am, and to publicly say, like, ‘Oh yeah, I’m an influencer,’” he tells me when we speak by Zoom. “I just never thought that’s where my career would ultimately take me.”\nOn December 30, Dunn again found himself in front of the camera—this time for a very different reason. He’d just returned from a trip to New Orleans and suddenly felt compelled to speak out about the TikTok ban. “This has all really been the highest point of my life so far,” he said in a two-minute video, tears falling down his face. “This app could really be gone next month. And I really hate to be on here crying about this, but this app could really be gone. Years of hard work could just be gone.”\nWill TikTok survive? It’s what many users like Dunn are waiting to find out as the US Supreme Court decides whether or not to uphold a law that would force China-based parent company ByteDance to sell TikTok to US owners or be blocked. Many believe the ban would be a monumental blow to creators. Currently, 170 million Americans use TikTok; several, like Dunn, rely on it as their main generator of income. According to the Pew Research Center, the app is used by one-third of all US adults.\nThe dispute in front of the Supreme Court boils down to whether the US government’s belief that TikTok is a national security threat supersedes the First Amendment right to free speech. In 2023, President Joe Biden signed into law the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), which requires ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US operation by January 19 or risk getting banned in the US.\nOn Friday, TikTok made its case before the Supreme Court. Noel Francisco, arguing on behalf of TikTok, opened by making a case for free speech and calling out what he saw to be the government’s excessive and undue concerns around national security. When asked by the judges why TikTok had yet to divest, Francisco said it would take “many years” to rebuild the source code, and the result would be an altogether different platform from TikTok.\nThe Biden administration’s solicitor general, Elizabeth B. Prelogar, argued that Congress had every right to enact a ban, saying that the Chinese government could spy on Americans, in addition to their contacts, through the app. “It's about trying to close off a vulnerability that a foreign nation’s adversary could exploit,” she said. Outside the courtroom, dozens of TikTok users rallied in support of the app. Given the January 19 deadline, the court is likely to make a decision next week—one that could have lasting ramifications on the future of social media for creators. If it goes into effect, it remains unclear if, or how, president-elect Trump will enforce the ban once in office.\n“I would ultimately feel like I lost it all,” Dunn says when I ask him about the ban. “I don’t think people realize this is how I keep a roof over my head. It’s like people saying your company’s about to go out of business and you have zero control over it.”\nIn addition to brand deals, Dunn participates in TikTok’s creator rewards program, which pays creators with a minimum of 10,000 followers and 100,000 monthly views to make original minutes-long content. Between brand partnerships and money made through the program, Dunn, who is 30, tells me he averaged several “five-figure months” in 2024. “The loss of jobs and income from this is going to be far greater than the national security risks they are screaming about,” he says.\nTikTok Shop, the app’s ecommerce feature, was a game changer for small business owners when it debuted in September 2023. After navigating a few early hiccups—which included, of all things, snail slime—TikTok Shop proved formidable; the app’s surge in vendors outpaced competitors like Amazon, which TikTok ultimately wants to replace (or at least dethrone). Beauty products and womens wear are often the highest-selling items across the platform. According to Shopify, by 2023 12 percent of TikTok Shops were US-based, with 45 percent of Americans having purchased through TikTok Shop. In 2023, daily US sales topped $7 million.\nRenee McClintock, a 29-year-old mother of two, is one of the app’s more tenacious entrepreneurs. You name it, she’s sold it: electrolyte packets, a cotton candy machine, iPhone cases, blue jeans, vaginal probiotic gummies. Last summer, a video detailing how much she’d made in a week—$4,764.63—went viral. McClintock declined to speak with me for this story—she only does paid collaborations, starting at $150, she wrote in an email—but noted that since July, through the affiliate program, her gross merchandise volume was $600,000.\nTikTok is not the only platform that allows creators to turn a profit, but it does seem to be the exception to the rule. YouTube, Instagram, and Twitch all provide various pathways for users to make money, whether through ads or affiliate links. But none of them have what TikTok has, says Jon Selman, vice president of influencer marketing at BENlabs, an agency whose clients include influencers Collins Key, Savagemomlife, and Amaury Guichon.\n“After Amazon, TikTok Shop has now become one of the biggest money drivers for brands,” Selman says. “They’ve invested a lot of money in the infrastructure, in shipping, in making it feel—I hate to say this—Amazon-y, because that is the standard of how you order online. Initially, the potential loss of that would be a pretty big blow. Brands would be scrambling.”\nThe ban would also thrust creators into uncharted territory. For as long as social media has been around, forced extinction was never so blatantly on the table. Many platforms have lost relevancy or simply died off—Friendster, Myspace, Vine—but never before has the US government pushed a social media platform into its own grave.\n“Creators need contingency plans,” Selman adds. “People are looking for a one-size-fits-all fix—Where do I go from here? And there isn’t one.” Younger audiences may very well float to YouTube Shorts, while older millennials will use Instagram Reels. It’s all about knowing where your audience lives, he says.\nIn the interim, TikTok users have voiced outrage about the ban. A decision in favor of the US government would likely crater the livelihoods of creators, some of whom don’t know where to go next. “Honestly, it’s hard to truly prepare for the ban,” says Kaityn Gale, a 23-year-old lifestyle influencer in Colorado. “Other platforms just don’t offer the same algorithm or opportunity. It’s a lot harder to monetize. I think the government fails to recognize how great of an impact this will have on American lives and the economy. TikTok has allowed me to be free of financial anxiety.”\nNo matter what happens, Dunn is determined to make it work. He recently launched a YouTube page and is figuring out how to better leverage his Instagram account. “Everybody thinks I can just repost a TikTok to Instagram and YouTube, and it will play out the same—it doesn’t work like that,” he says.\nSo, where do you go from here, I ask him before we end our video call.\n“When I think about the future of the creator economy—and I have to be honest—what worries me is creators that look like me, the Black and brown ones, the ones who may not have the necessary tools and resources to be successful in spaces that demand a more polished product,” he says. “TikTok has allowed for a lot of different creators who look different, who sound different, and who operate differently, to enter and be successful in this space. It’s going to be harder for those communities—that’s what no one is talking about.”",

Outside the courtroom, dozens of <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahebaus/video/7458313414528617774\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahebaus/video/7458313414528617774\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahebaus/video/7458313414528617774\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok users rallied</a> in support of the app. Given the January 19 deadline, the court is likely to make a decision next week—one that could have lasting ramifications on the future of social media for creators. If it goes into effect, it remains unclear if, or how, president-elect Trump will <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/live/tiktok-scotus-live-coverage/?id=67815972bb5a4142913eb1c1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">enforce the ban</a> once in office.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“I would ultimately feel like I lost it all,” Dunn says when I ask him about the ban. “I don’t think people realize this is how I keep a roof over my head. It’s like people saying your company’s about to go out of business and you have zero control over it.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">In addition to brand deals, Dunn participates in TikTok’s creator rewards program, which <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/how-much-are-people-making-off-tiktok-creator-rewards-program\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/how-much-are-people-making-off-tiktok-creator-rewards-program\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/how-much-are-people-making-off-tiktok-creator-rewards-program\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pays creators</a> with a minimum of 10,000 followers and 100,000 monthly views to make original minutes-long content. Between brand partnerships and money made through the program, Dunn, who is 30, tells me he averaged several “five-figure months” in 2024. “The loss of jobs and income from this is going to be far greater than the national security risks they are screaming about,” he says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">TikTok Shop, the app’s ecommerce feature, was a game changer for small business owners when it debuted in September 2023. After navigating a few early hiccups—which included, of all things, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-shop-fake-scam-products/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">snail slime</a>—TikTok Shop proved formidable; the app’s <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/social-media-news/tiktok-shop/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/social-media-news/tiktok-shop/\" href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/social-media-news/tiktok-shop/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">surge in vendors</a> outpaced competitors like Amazon, which TikTok ultimately wants to replace (or at least dethrone).

    "content_text": "Joe Biden’s climate legacy is already complicated. His administration helped pass two laws that put unprecedented funding toward clean energy, electric vehicles, and climate technology—the most consequential climate legislation ever passed in the US. Since the start of his presidential race, the Biden administration has tried to frame climate change as an economic opportunity—a kind of climate nationalism that attempts to use clean reindustrialization as a bridge across ideological divides.\nYet the administration has not left behind the old way of doing things. Oil and gas production has never been higher. Biden’s approval of the controversial Willow oil drilling project in Alaska draws into question the country’s commitment to a transition to clean energy while there is still money to be made in fossil fuels.\nHis biggest failure may be passing on the White House to a president who has promised to roll back climate policies and withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, and who has selected for his closest advisers people with close links to the fossil fuel industry and in some cases outright climate denialists.\nAs President Biden’s national climate adviser, Ali Zaidi helped shape much of the administration’s climate policy. A long-term adviser to the president, Zaidi leads the White House Climate Policy Office, which was established by Biden in one of his first executive orders as president.\nZaidi sat down with WIRED to discuss Biden’s climate legacy. The interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nWIRED: Let’s start by jumping way forward in time to 2050—the deadline the US has set itself for reaching net-zero emissions. How do you think we’ll perceive the Biden administration’s role in that long journey?\nAli Zaidi: What we’ll see is that in a number of sectors across our economy, this administration was the moment when we achieved escape velocity on a shift from polluting products to cleaner ones. You think about the transition that’s taking place in vehicles, from internal combustion engines to strong hybrids, fully electric, hydrogen, fully sustainable aviation fuels. That is now on a secular trajectory. The destination is clear.\nWhen history looks back at this moment, it’ll look at areas like that. Or the electricity sector when in 2024, 96 percent of the new electricity we put onto the system was clean electricity, and we put more power on than we have in two decades. In other sectors it will reflect that we built the launchpad. Maybe we didn’t get to escape velocity, but in areas like industrial decarbonization—things like steel, cement, and aluminum—we put together the tools that enabled that transformation to take place over the next several decades.\nHistorically—and some of this still lingers—some people view climate policies as asking them to give things up. It’s why electric vehicle mandates and something like New York’s ban on natural gas stoves are still divisive.\nThis administration has made a big effort to reframe green policies in terms of reshoring, reindustrialization, and so on. Is that narrative getting through to people?\nThe fundamental change was from a narrative of sacrifice, about gloom and doom, to one that embraces hope and possibilities. I worked for President Biden when he was running; weaving this into the economic construct was something we did in Google Docs in the summer of 2020. I was writing this up as just a hope and prayer back then.\nWe went from not only trying to execute a paradigm shift from doom and gloom to hope and possibilities but also from focusing on a global problem decades in the making to one that was principally about benefits that work close to people in time and place. I think that’s paying off, to use a George H.W. Bush phrase, in the “thousand points of light” across the country. The 900 factories and counting to manufacture clean electricity, goods and materials—these folks feel uplift. They feel part of a project of economic revival.\nAnd this project retains the durability, because if Washington decides to deprioritize it, now you’ve got these factories on the ground. You can taste the economic opportunity, and I think folks are going to keep chasing that and capital is going to keep chasing that.\nThat’s true for some parts of the climate economy, but others still need a bunch of government support before they get that traction. One area is direct air capture, which the Biden administration has supported with funding and tax credits. A lot of people in that space think this support, with the incoming administration, is vulnerable.\nDirect air capture is at an inflection point that could break a number of different ways. There is nothing self-evident about the US leading. It will require sustained effort. But something we’ve been very purposeful about is building a lot of interconnectedness in every part of the deep decarbonization puzzle. So when you think about batteries, we’re pitching batteries into the grid, into the transport sector. We’re trying to do the materials science that feeds into the supply chain in a way that will also support advances in electrolyzer technology and the hydrogen market.\nWhen you look at something like direct air capture and the fundamental technology that’s going into that, which is not entirely dissimilar from other capture-related technologies, then frankly a lot of the technical complexity is not just in the capture, it’s in the midstream and storage and sequestration, by building a carbon management demand signal and muscle memory in agriculture and fuels in heavy industry. I think we’ve made it so there’s a lot more resilience and momentum behind it.\nWe’re talking right now as wildfires rage across Los Angeles. A lot of Americans will be worried about climate policy over the next four years. As someone who has been in this space for a long time, what metrics will you be looking at over the next four years to figure out if the country is backsliding on its climate commitments?\nNumber one is the factory floor. I’m a big believer in “show me where your country is devoting its factory floor and I’ll tell you whether that country can lead in the economy of the future.” I hope smart investors and thoughtful policy makers are facilitating the growth of manufacturing capacity—whether that’s for next generation nuclear or battery deployment.\nThe second is whether we’re continuing to deal more and more people into the transformation. We’ve got over 100,000 farmers and ranchers that are now taking on climate-smart agricultural practices. Will that climate action, that distributed climate action, continue to expand?\nThe last thing is how good are we at building the stuff we need to build. The steel in the ground. One of the things we’ve been trying to develop as a discipline is really a professionalization in the development of social license around these new technologies so they can scale. Can we build at the speed we need to by making sure that when a tower goes up, the community feels like they built the barn together, not like they were shortchanged?\nWe’ve talked about economic and industrial leadership, but political leadership really matters too. Trump has signaled he will withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, for the second time in five years. Won’t that make it much harder to hit that trajectory you were just describing?\nDoes that one action spell the end of US climate leadership or sideline us in the progress we need to make? No. But it carries with it symbolism and probably a lot of second-order implications.\nSince the beginning of this administration we have had in the West Wing a climate headquarters. A new team. Gina McCarthy led it, now I do. We’ve got senior directors on my team that focus on every sector of the economy, with backgrounds in science, business, engineering, policy.\nWhat happens when you don’t have that level of focus at the highest level with the substantial commitment of very talented people driving it? What happens when the US shows up to multilateral fora or bilateral conversations and does not prioritize setting the rules of the road for the clean energy economy?\nI think what happens is the US sidelines American workers in the race for clean energy jobs, and we diminish our influence globally. Not only is the climate not going to be on pause over the next four years, our competitors are not slowing down—to seize the advantage on clean energy technologies, but also for global influence.\nFour years is not a lot of time. You must have come into this thinking about a second term. Are you thinking about the things you wanted to get done but can’t?\nThe big things are, number one, the sectors where we haven’t reached escape velocity. We’ve got to keep pushing for the sake of our economy. That’s unfinished business that needs to be carried forward by state and local governments, by the private sector, and hopefully by the federal government.\nThe second thing is making sure we are investing enough in talent and the workforce. We have a bad habit in this country of skimming talent off the top and not investing in the institutions that pull more people into the workforce. Unions are at the front of that; Biden spent a lot of time on apprenticeship growth.\nAnd then there’s a lot of work to be done to take on the climate crisis in a way that works really well for US economic interests and our national security, but in a way that positions us as a strong ally and partner to all the nations that seek a more stable and secure future. If you deny climate change, it makes it hard to be a global leader. Folks don’t follow the ostrich with its head in the sand.\nRight.\nWe’ve got to have the vision and the tools to be able to help the most vulnerable populations around the world and also equip them for this challenge and tap into the economic opportunity for themselves. That will ultimately be good for US industry, US innovators, US workers.\nI just came from Jimmy Carter’s funeral service, so I’ll leave you with a thought from a sermon. My favorite sermon from Dr. King is the one where he talks about Schubert’s unfinished symphony. He talks about how when you work on building temples of justice, temples of hope, you work on it knowing that you are building a temple that is not going to be finished and certainly not going to be finished during your time.\nWhat we’re doing with climate in this administration is not just an exercise in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It’s been the more powerful work of being engaged in uplift, in revival, and giving people a sense of hope and purpose. At the end of the day that’s a fundamentally unfinished exercise, but it’s a beautiful one. It belongs in the category of symphony and temple.",

    "content_text": "A device capable of intercepting phone signals was likely deployed during the 2024 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago, WIRED has learned, raising critical questions about who authorized its use and for what purpose.\nThe device, known as a cell-site simulator, was identified by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a digital rights advocacy organization, after analyzing wireless signal data collected by WIRED during the August event.\nCell-site simulators mimic cell towers to intercept communications, indiscriminately collecting sensitive data such as call metadata, location information, and app traffic from all phones within their range. Their use has drawn widespread criticism from privacy advocates and activists, who argue that such technology can be exploited to covertly monitor protesters and suppress dissent.\nThe DNC convened amid widespread protests over Israel’s assault on Gaza. While credentialed influencers attended exclusive yacht parties and VIP events, thousands of demonstrators faced a heavy law enforcement presence, including officers from the US Capitol Police, the Secret Service, Homeland Security Investigations, local sheriff’s offices, and Chicago police.\nConcerns over potential surveillance prompted WIRED to conduct a first-of-its-kind wireless survey to investigate whether cell-site simulators were being deployed. Reporters, equipped with two rooted Android phones and Wi-Fi hot spots running detection software, used Rayhunter—a tool developed by the EFF to detect data anomalies associated with these devices. WIRED’s reporters monitored signals at protests and event locations across Chicago, collecting extensive data during the political convention.\nInitial tests conducted during the DNC revealed no conclusive evidence of cell-site simulator activity. However, months later, EFF technologists reanalyzed the raw data using improved detection methods. According to Cooper Quintin, a senior technologist at the EFF, the Rayhunter tool stores all interactions between devices and cell towers, allowing for deeper analysis as detection techniques evolve.\nA breakthrough came when EFF technologists applied a new heuristic to examine situations where cell towers requested IMSI (international mobile subscriber identity) numbers from devices. According to the EFF’s analysis, on August 18—the day before the convention officially began—a device carried by WIRED reporters en route a hotel housing Democratic delegates from states in the US Midwest abruptly switched to a new tower. That tower asked for the device’s IMSI and then immediately disconnected—a sequence consistent with the operation of a cell-site simulator.\n“This is extremely suspicious behavior that normal towers do not exhibit,” Quintin says. He notes that the EFF typically observed similar patterns only during simulated and controlled attacks. “This is not 100 percent incontrovertible truth, but it’s strong evidence suggesting a cell-site simulator was deployed. We don’t know who was responsible—it could have been the US government, foreign actors, or another entity.”\nUnder Illinois law, law enforcement agencies must obtain a warrant to deploy cell-site simulators. Similarly, federal agents—including those from the Department of Homeland Security—are required to secure warrants unless an immediate national security threat exists. However, a 2023 DHS Inspector General report found that both the Secret Service and Homeland Security Investigations did not always comply with these requirements.\nThe Chicago Police Department tells WIRED it did not deploy a cell-site simulator during the DNC, while the Secret Service tells WIRED in a statement that, “as a matter of practice,” it does not discuss the “means and methods” of its operations for “National Special Security Events.”\nOther components of DHS as well as the DNC have not responded to requests for comment.\nQuintin notes that the EFF detected similar anomalous behavior in a previous test conducted in Washington, DC’s Embassy Row, an area known for its high concentration of embassies and diplomatic offices. It wouldn’t be the first time that cell-site simulators were found in the nation's capitol. In 2019, the FBI accused Israel’s government of deploying a cell-site simulator near the White House—a claim Israel denied.\nWhile the possible deployment of a cell-site simulator at the DNC has raised more questions than answers, for privacy and civil liberties advocates the implications are troubling nonetheless.\nNate Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, says, “It would be a big deal if the digital artifacts you found were in fact due to the presence of a cell-site simulator deployed to identify people at a protest.” However, Wessler adds, “it is also entirely possible that law enforcement was using a cell-site simulator in the area for a lawful purpose.”\nFor Wessler, the lack of clarity around their use is itself a cause for concern. “The ambiguity is really chilling,” he says. “The uncertainty around their use undermines people’s ability to express themselves.”",

    "content_text": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed a new measure on Friday that could protect your Robux from scammers and hackers.\nThe proposed rule would interpret terms in the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, or EFTA, which has traditionally been used to protect consumers from unauthorized debit transactions, to include some virtual currencies supplied by gaming and cryptocurrency companies.\n“Gamers—or in some cases their parents and guardians—have reported issues such as trouble when converting dollars to in-game currency, unauthorized transactions, account hacks and takeovers, theft, scams, and loss of assets,” reads the CFPB’s post announcing the proposal. “They have also described receiving limited to no help from gaming companies and the banks or digital wallets involved. Refunds are often denied, people are finding their gaming accounts suspended by the video game company after a player tries to get a refund from their financial institution, or people are left caught in doom loops with AI-powered customer service representatives while they’re just trying to get straight answers.”\nFriday’s proposal is meant to fix these issues. The EFTA protects consumers transferring funds electronically, limits their liability for errors, and provides them with ways to correct illicit transactions. Once notified by the consumer, covered financial institutions are required to conduct investigations into unauthorized transactions and promptly fix errors. In its proposed interpretation, the CFPB is saying that consumers have these same rights when using some virtual currencies.\nStill, the EFTA will likely apply only to games that allow players to exchange currencies among themselves using accounts that resemble “consumer asset accounts.” For example, the popular children’s game platform Roblox allows creators to earn Robux by selling cosmetic items or building their own in-game worlds and experiences. Through Roblox’s DevEx program, Robux can be converted into US dollars.\nNot all games that feature in-game currency will necessarily be subject to the rule. Fortnite players, for example, can spend cash for V-Bucks in order to buy cosmetic items and “battle passes,” but the currency can’t be exchanged between players and other merchants.\nLast year, the CFPB put gaming companies on notice, issuing a report detailing the risks involved with purchasing and transferring virtual currencies. In it, the agency argued that virtual banks and currencies on gaming and crypto platforms increasingly resemble traditional banking infrastructure, with few protections for users if the funds are lost or stolen.\n“Americans of all ages are converting billions of dollars into currencies used on virtual reality and gaming platforms,” CFPB director Rohit Chopra said in a statement about these transactions last year. “As more banking and payment activity takes place in video games and virtual worlds, the CFPB is looking at ways to protect consumers from frauds and scams.”\nThe video game industry has remained largely unregulated, despite facing multiple lawsuits and government investigations over the past few years. Just last month, the Federal Trade Commission reached a settlement with Epic Games, the developer of Fortnite, requiring the company return more than $245 million in refunds to users who were allegedly duped into buying the game’s virtual currency.\nThe CFPB’s proposal likely won’t go into effect anytime soon. In a press release issued Friday, the agency said that it would be soliciting feedback, specifically from gamers, about the protections they need. The deadline for feedback is March 31, 2025.",

    "content_text": "TikTok SCOTUS Live Blog: The Court Hears Arguments Over Potential Ban\nWe’re tuning in live as the justices consider what could be one of the most consequential First Amendment rulings of the past several decades.\nThe Supreme Court has now concluded oral arguments after deliberating for roughly two and a half hours over a law that requires TikTok to be sold or banned in the US. Some of the justices voiceed concerns about the regulation potentially violating the First Amendment.\nBut they also seemed convinced by the government’s arguments about the need to protect national security, viewing the heart of the issue as one about ownership, rather than speech. (TikTok’s parent company is the Chinese tech giant ByteDance.) A decision in the case is expected to arrive quickly. In the meantime, catch up on all of WIRED’s coverage of TikTok:\n- How the US TikTok Ban Would Actually Work\n- Does TikTok Really Pose a Risk to US National Security?\n- Can the First Amendment Save TikTok?\n- TikTok’s Defense Strategy Involves Throwing Shein and Temu Under the Bus\n- The Push to Ban TikTok in the US Isn’t About Privacy\n- Most US TikTok Creators Don’t Think a Ban Will Happen\n- A TikTok Whistleblower Got DC’s Attention. Do His Claims Add Up?\n- TikTok Employees Shrug Off the US Election\nPrelogar cites how Elon Musk bought Twitter in less than six months, arguing there's no reason TikTok couldn't find a buyer in a similar amount of time. If I were her, I would be wary about bringing up Musk—he has significant business interests in China, and has been repeatedly criticized for his silence on political and human rights issues in the country.\nPrelogar keeps hammering the argument that the Chinese government could gain access to sensitive data through TikTok. It's a hard thing to dispute, but if that was the main concern motivating Congress when it passed the ban-or-divest law, you have to wonder why they didn't try to enact broader privacy protections that would prevent the Chinese government from getting data from other apps and services.\nFor context, the US intelligence community is currently reeling after discovering that hackers linked to the PRC wormed their way deep into US telecommunications infrastructure, potentially compromising things like phone calls and text messages. The US Treasury also disclosed last month it got hacked by China.\nThe government takes a different view on what happens after January 19, suggesting that divestiture could take place even after the deadline. TikTok's attorney suggested the app would basically go dark. (For what it's worth, the likelist thing is that it would just sort of putter for existing users along until it becomes unusable.)\nRegarding the surveillance issue, TikTok admitted that it had inappropriately accessed data belonging to US users, including journalists from Forbes and the Financial Times, as part of an effort to find leakers. TikTok and ByteDance said they fired everyone involved in the operation.\nAs I previously reported, the initiative was led by TikTok's hyper-aggressive internal security team, which drew criticism from many employees at TikTok. The sources I spoke to indicated the team was mostly staffed by former US and European law enforcement officials.\nPrelogar brought up the time when ByteDance was found to have surveilled a US journalist to find out which employee's leaking information to the press. This, in my opinion, is one of the worst PR nightmare ByteDance has done in recent years and one of the strongest evidence that the US government has to hold ByteDance responsible.",

    "content_text": "As a series of massive fires continues to blaze through the Los Angeles area, blanketing neighborhoods with smoke and forcing thousands of people to evacuate their homes, air quality remains unhealthy throughout many parts of the county.\nWildfire smoke is a mixture of water vapor, gases, and microscopic particles known as particulate matter. The smallest of these particles, known as PM2.5 because they have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, pose the most danger to human health. They can lodge deep in the lungs and sometimes enter the bloodstream. Earlier this week, PM2.5 around Los Angeles rose to “hazardous” levels, the highest warning on the US Air Quality Index.\n“Wildfire smoke is risky for everybody, especially when the particulate matter that is being released is in large quantities for long periods, like what is happening in California right now,” says Zachary Rubin, a Chicago-area pediatric allergist and spokesperson for the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology.\nWhen fine particulate matter is inhaled, it can trigger inflammation in the body. Symptoms can range from the mild, such as burning or itchy eyes, runny nose, scratchy throat, and headache, to severe respiratory issues, including difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, fatigue, and chest pain. It can take anywhere from a few hours to days after exposure for symptoms to appear. In the most serious of cases, it increases the risk of premature death.\nChildren, older adults, pregnant individuals, and those with heart or lung conditions or weakened immune systems are at higher risk of developing severe side effects. But Rubin says it’s possible for anyone, regardless of their health status, to have respiratory effects from exposure to wildfire smoke.\n“Any level of air pollution, including from wildfires, can be dangerous for your health,” says Laura Corlin, an environmental epidemiologist at Tufts University School of Medicine. Just how dangerous depends on many factors, including your existing health status, your proximity to the fire, and the duration of exposure. “A good rule of thumb is that more exposure is worse,” she says.\nThe composition of a wildfire can also have an impact on human health. With the California fires engulfing homes and businesses, smoke in the region is likely carrying chemicals released from synthetic building materials that are more toxic than those emitted from burning vegetation.\nPeople in Los Angeles County and elsewhere in the US can check airnow.gov to learn more about the current air quality in their area. As air quality can change quickly during the day, you should monitor readings regularly if there is a fire burning in your area, and try to limit your exposure to outdoor air when the quality is poor. The Watch Duty app is a good resource for checking if there are fires burning close to where you are.\nHow to Protect Yourself and Others\n“The lungs purify the air that we breathe in and sends it to the heart, and the heart pumps it to the rest of the body,” says Shazia Jamil, a pulmonologist and professor of medicine at the Scripps Clinic and University of California, San Diego. Jamil helped develop a guide for the American Thoracic Society on how to stay healthy during wildfires.\nShe says if someone is short of breath, wheezing, or has an elevated respiratory rate from inhaling smoke, that makes the heart beat faster and can exacerbate preexisting heart problems. Even healthy people can experience chest pain and shortness of breath due to smoke inhalation.\nIt’s why health officials in Los Angeles County are urging everyone in areas with unhealthy air quality to stay indoors as much as possible. They should also limit exercise and other kinds of physical exertion, even when indoors. “When we do any strenuous physical activity, we are actually breathing deeper and we are breathing faster,” Jamil says. Coupled with air pollution, physical activity can lead to breathing problems.\nWhen indoors, close windows and doors. Wet towels can be used to seal off any potential cracks. Avoid using air conditioners that only bring in outside air and don’t recirculate. Air purifiers that use a HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter can help reduce fine particles indoors. Fireplaces, candles, vacuums, gas stoves, and aerosols should be avoided, since they emit fine particles and can worsen indoor air quality.\nIf you must go outside, experts recommend wearing an N95 or P100 mask, which will block out 95 percent or more of very small particles. Bandanas and cloth masks are not effective against wildfire smoke. When traveling in a car, you can reduce smoke exposure by keeping the windows closed, turning on the air conditioner, and setting the air to recirculate.\nWhile healthy people can have reactions to particulate matter, those with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, are most sensitive to it. Fine particulate matter can travel into the small airways of the lungs, exacerbating their condition. People with asthma and COPD should take their inhalers or other medications as prescribed.\nBabies and children are at risk because their lungs are still developing. And as people age, their lung function naturally declines, so those 65 and older are also vulnerable. Wildfire smoke can aggravate heart problems as well.\nBeware of the Lingering Threat\nEven after the initial blaze has passed or been extinguished, wildfire smoke can continue to cause health issues. A 2023 study found that even after an initial cleaning by air purifiers, wildfire smoke can attach to home surfaces like carpet, drapes, and countertops, potentially prolonging exposure for people inside. Simple surface cleaning, like vacuuming, dusting, and mopping, can reduce exposure and limit risk.\nIn the coming days and weeks, more people outside the Los Angeles area may be at risk of smoke-related health issues. Wildlife smoke can travel hundreds of miles through the atmosphere. During the record-setting 2023 wildfires in Western Canada, some parts of the Eastern United States, including New York City and Philadelphia, were temporarily ensconced in smoke. “Smoke winds can travel over surprisingly long distances and time periods,” Corlin says.\nAnd that smoke can cause health problems hundreds of miles from the fire itself. In a study published in December, researchers at the University of Maryland found that medical visits for heart and lung problems rose by nearly 20 percent during six days in June 2023, when smoke from the Western Canadian wildfires drifted across the country, leading to poor air quality days in Baltimore and the surrounding region.",

    "content_text": "Honda believes you want to talk to your car.\nThe Japanese automaker this week shared new details about its 0 Series, its latest foray into electric vehicles. Two EVs, the 0 Saloon and the 0 SUV, will debut in 2026, with rounded, offbeat styling that whispers the future. The electric element is just a bit part of the innovation planned, Honda executives promised onstage at CES in Las Vegas. In a presentation during the show, Honda electrification head Katsushi Inoue emphasized the “new level of intelligent vehicle technology” built into the 0 series.\n“The Honda approach to the art of making things has always been human-centric,” he said, then showed off sort of the opposite: a talking robot built right into the car.\nTo show the robot in action, Honda then screened a short video that showed a driver speaking intimately with the Her-like system that lives inside her electric car, with the chatbot embodied by a Siri-like animation on the dash. “Saloon is my partner, always by my side, opening me up to new experiences and expanding my world,” the theoretical Saloon driver said during the promotional video. “Tell me more about yourself,” the car said. “Of course,” the driver answered.\nThe 0 Series will come with a new operating system, Asimo, named after Honda’s path-breaking robot from the 1980s. This onboard OS is designed to continuously update its experience according to the preferences of the driver. The system “will allow Honda to deliver a personalized ownership experience that will enhance the joy of driving,” the automaker said in a press release.\nIndeed, the evidence that automakers are hoping to reshape drivers’ intimate relationships with their cars was all over Las Vegas.\n“It was a theme across CES: You’re talking to a machine. You’re not connecting to humans,” says Jessica Caldwell, the director of insights at Edmunds. “Everywhere you look, there are robots.”\nMany automakers and suppliers rolled out experiences and design updates laser focused on adapting to drivers’ preferences through software systems and interiors—and finding new ways to make them happy inside the closed (and maybe lonely?) cabin.\nSony Honda Mobility has shown off its electric Afeela prototype before, but now we know where the electronics manufacturers’ involvement came in: The car will come stocked with entertainment, including the ability to stream television shows and play games from both the driver and rear passenger seats. (Drivers will have to limit PlayStation-ing to when the car is still.)\nHyundai Mobis’ “holographic” windshield display, which won’t go into production until at least 2027, is designed to allow drivers and passengers to have different experiences even while sitting side by side. A driver could see directions and the speed limit while the passenger might watch a film right beside them. BMW’s presentation also had a showy, visual element. Its new Panoramic iDrive infotainment system has a wide, central screen and an optional 3D heads-up display. It will launch later this year.\nThis focus on the driving experience has dovetailed, conveniently, with continuing buzz around generative AI. A year ago at CES, Mercedes-Benz showed off the MBUX Virtual Assistant, designed to allow drivers to navigate to or search for destinations, topics, or other car functions while behind the wheel through natural-feeling interaction. The system, Mercedes-Benz has said, has its own personality traits: “natural, predictive, personal, and empathetic.”\nBut Honda seemed to take robot personalization to a new level this year. “With Saloon, I can always be myself,” the actor in the promotional video said.\nThe advances raise big questions: How much time do drivers really want to spend inside their cars? What will they like their relationships with those hunks of metal to look like in the future? Above all: Can a car be a friend?",

    "content_text": "Record temperatures last year pushed the global water cycle to “new climatic extremes,” according to the Global Water Monitor 2024 report. The document, produced by an international consortium led by researchers at Australian National University, states that these climatic anomalies caused devastating floods and droughts that resulted in more than 8,700 deaths, the displacement of 40 million people, and economic losses exceeding $550 billion.\nThe report was conducted by an international team and was led by ANU professor Albert van Dijk. It reveals that 2024 was the warmest year so far for nearly 4 billion people in 111 countries, and that air temperatures over the Earth’s surface were 1.2 degrees Celsius higher than documented at the beginning of the century and 2.2 degrees Celsius higher than at the start of the Industrial Revolution.\nVan Dijk asserts that water systems around the globe were affected. “From historic droughts to catastrophic floods, these severe climate variations affect lives, livelihoods, and entire ecosystems. Water is our most important resource, and its extreme conditions are among the greatest threats we face,” he says.\nThe report authors analyzed data from thousands of ground and satellite stations that collect near real-time information on critical water variables, including rainfall intensity and frequency, soil moisture, and flooding.\n“We found rainfall records are being broken with increasing regularity. For example, record-high monthly rainfall totals were achieved 27 percent more frequently in 2024 than at the start of this century, whereas daily rainfall records were achieved 52 percent more frequently. Record lows were 38 percent more frequent, so we are seeing worse extremes on both sides,” says Van Dijk.\nThe research states that, as a consequence, sea-surface temperatures rose, intensifying tropical cyclones and droughts in the Amazon basin and southern Africa. Global warming favored the formation of slower-moving storms in Europe, Asia, and Brazil, subjecting some regions—such as Valencia in Spain—to extremely high levels of rain. Widespread flash floods occurred in Afghanistan and Pakistan, while rising levels in the Yangtze and Pearl rivers in southern China damaged rice crops.\n“In Bangladesh, heavy monsoon rains and the release of water from dams affected more than 5.8 million people, and at least 1 million tons of rice were wiped out. In the Amazon basin, forest fires triggered by the hot, dry weather devastated more than 52,000 square kilometers in September alone, releasing huge amounts of greenhouse gases,” Van Dijk says.\nThe study adds that changes in the water cycle intensified food shortages, impaired shipping routes, and disrupted hydropower generation in some regions. “We need to prepare for and adapt to inevitably more severe extreme events. That may mean adopting stronger flood defenses, developing new food production systems and more drought-resistant water supply networks,” suggests Van Dijk.\nWorld leaders have pledged to implement measures and policies to prevent global warming from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of the century, but the World Meteorological Organization has pointed out that current efforts are insufficient. The WMO estimates that there is an 80 percent chance that the average global temperature will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels again in at least one of the next five years. The projection suggests that humanity is far from meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and raises new concerns about the progress of climate change.\nSecuring financial resources is another challenge. The United Nations Environment Program estimates that the funding gap for climate change adaptation is between $194 billion and $366 billion annually.\nAntónio Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, has said that “we are teetering on a planetary tightrope. Either leaders close the emissions gap or we are hurtling towards climate disaster, with the poorest and most vulnerable suffering the most. The countdown to action has begun.”\nThis story originally appeared on Wired en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "content_text": "For three days, horrific wildfires have torn through Los Angeles, and they are still raging. The Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles have moved so fast that people have been stuck in their homes or had to abandon cars and wheelchairs on the side of the road to escape the flames. Those waiting to hear whether their houses have burned are living in agonized dread. Many of them have turned to Watch Duty, a fire-tracking app that has become an indispensable source of information in an uncertain time.\nWatch Duty is an app that tracks wildfires and disaster information and presents it to users in as close to real time as possible in the form of maps and notifications about fire perimeters, evacuation zones, and air quality. Its CEO and founding father is John Clarke Mills, a Northern California resident who was inspired to create the app after a wildfire in 2021 threatened his home. Frustrated by a lack of timely information about the whereabouts of the fire and unsure whether he should evacuate, Mills funneled that anger and anxiety into a platform that aims to help people track fire movements near them. The app has slowly grown into a critical resource for people in fire-prone areas, and now covers 22 states across the western and central US.\nThe sheer scale of the Los Angeles fires and the prominence of the location have delivered an unprecedented amount of eyeballs to the young platform. The service gained 600,000 users overnight and became the top app in Apple’s iOS app store, unseating ChatGPT. The app has surged in popularity before, but never quite to this degree.\nThat’s maybe not surprising; Mills himself says these fires are like nothing he’s ever seen. I spoke to Mills while he was driving into San Francisco on January 9, the third day into the blistering firestorm. We talked about how Watch Duty’s small staff has managed this influx of users, what happens next for the platform, and what he thinks of all the armchair experts on social media.\n(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\nBoone Ashworth: How are you doing? How’s Watch Duty?\nJohn Mills: This is bonkers, man. We're having our Oprah moment right now, unfortunately.\nThere have been big fires before, but this one has really gone wild.\nThis is such a destructive fire. This one is just so populated, that's the difference. We've had “worse” fires. But, like how do you judge worse? This is fucking disastrous. Jesus.\nWhen did you realize that this one was beyond the scope of many other fires? When did shit hit the fan?\nThere was a very crazy red flag warning. And it was so bad that many government agencies started pre-positioning equipment down there knowing bad stuff was going to happen. The world knew, everybody knew. The meteorologists do their thing and say it's the worst thing ever. And they weren't wrong.\nIt's an incredibly, horribly wind-driven disaster. If there was rain, it would have been like, whatever, man, some trees fell over. But pretty quickly based upon location, topography, weather, wind, you're like, oh no, this one's going to make its way all the way to the Pacific Coast Highway. So pretty quickly, we knew it was going to be bad.\nHow do you prepare for covering fires like this?\nWhat happens is the same as any emergency office. LA County was pre-positioning; we did the same. We're letting everybody know that this is going to be an all-hands-on-deck situation. Everyone cleared their schedules. People are sleeping in shifts, and we're making people take time off. Some of them are up for 18 hours. We're like, all right guys, you go to sleep, these people are taking over. And so we're trying to do air traffic control and keep them going. We're doing like 30,000 requests a second at peak right now. We're doing more users in an hour than we've done in like a month. It's absolutely bonkers.\nHas that influx of users put any strain on running the service?\nAbsolutely. We're throwing hardware at it. We're making tuning adjustments to the database and cache infrastructure as the plane’s in the air. We have a couple hundred machines online right now. That 30,000 requests per second is probably 10 times bigger than anything I've ever touched in my entire career. It's an incredible amount of weight to hold up. And luckily the team is doing it. Super proud of them for doing this, especially in a live firefight.\nIs there anything that's caught you off guard, or any adjustments you needed to make?\nYeah, there's always learnings. I mean, we'll probably have better answers to that question when this all settles. We do after-action reports and stuff like this, and we're actually going to start publishing some of those, which I think will be great for the community to see what's happening behind the scenes. We definitely need more staff. We've been OK, but it stretches people, right? It stretches folks, and some of them live in these fire areas. They lose power and have to evacuate, for God's sake. It’s not the first time we've had reporters who have to run from a fire.\nRight.\nWe just need more people who are going to stay up all night long and listen to the world burn.\nLet's talk about the official emergency response from the different fire agencies. How has that been going from your perspective?\nI mean, they're doing the best they goddamn can. When you get like a hurricane-force fire, what are you gonna do? There's people on the internet screaming about fire, how there’s not enough water. When it's like, guys, you would have to have an incredibly torrential downpour of rain to stop that kind of fire. People don't understand that you can't just throw water at a wind-driven fire. They're doing the best they can with what they got.\nPeople have all sorts of opinions about what's happening with the fires on social media. Have you spent much time on X lately? Have you seen what people are saying?\nIt’s not surprising that people on the internet have opinions. Let's use the Lahaina fire in Hawaii, for an example. Lahaina got so out of control with misinformation. People started painting their roofs blue because they think there are space lasers that can light their houses on fire. We just kind of stay above it as best we can and just try not to get too involved. We poke and prod when there's misinformation coming out, trying to put some reason out there, but we don't really engage too much in the discourse.\nLike, download Watch Duty and get results there. Otherwise, have at it, man. Have at it on the internet and hope it makes you feel better. I feel bad for them, honestly, you know? I've been through this before. But the way that I coped is by building Watch Duty, not by yelling into the ether. We all have our coping mechanisms. Some are productive and some are not.\nDo you think people being able to get more information about what’s happening on the ground will help them be smarter about what they're saying online? Or is all that shitposting still going to happen?\nI don't know, man. I wish I had a good answer that I could play into your question, but I just don't really, like, care about those people. It's just so uninteresting. People are still running from fire right now. And that's really what matters. I don't need armchair reporters now. There are great reporters who are not in Watch Duty, like a bunch of people who are out there relaying information to the populace on X, which is great. I'm glad they do it. I wish they had a better platform for it. There are still great people on social media, but unfortunately you have to sift through bitcoin porn and other random stuff that's being overridden by the Chinese bots right now.\nSo what's next? How does Watch Duty approach the next few days of this fire in particular, and then the fires beyond that?\nThis is a great time for an expression from Mike Tyson: “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.” Right now, we're getting punched in the face repeatedly. When I'm in that mode, we don't make strategic plans.\nWe're extraordinarily tactical. We focus on what's in front of us, just like a firefighter does. That's what we're doing today, keeping our servers online, keeping the engineers fed, making sure that they can keep this thing running as we're experiencing three orders of magnitude explosive growth. And then the reporters as well need sleep, need pep talks, need help. And so it's really just “get through this,” man. We're about to experience another wind event tonight. We are far from done and tonight's going to be another goddamn bad one.\nWhat about long-term? What’s the future of how people use Watch Duty?\nI can talk about long-term stuff because I've been thinking about it for ages. We're really thinking a lot about what it looks like to have other disasters in Watch Duty. We're actively developing that now. We're working on making sure that we can do the same thing we've done in LA for the next Hurricane Helene. Because those floods were disastrous. People did not have enough warning, did not understand it. And there is good data out there that is not being brought to the masses. We want to be a voice of reason throughout these really hard times. And so that is what is next for us when we get through this nonsense.\nBeats sitting there in despair.\nYeah. I gotta be constructive, you know?",

    "content_text": "The giant fires that are scouring Los Angeles have officially become the most destructive in the city’s history, killing at least six people and destroying at least 5,000 buildings. But as the winds driving the inferno have slackened, experts are cautiously optimistic that the blazes can soon be beaten back.\nWith reinforcements from other states, California firefighters have shifted from defense to offense. Rather than just saving individual buildings, they are now trying to stop the overall advance of the flames.\n“Tuesday and Wednesday our priority was saving lives and protecting as much property as possible,” says LA Fire Department spokesperson Margaret Stewart. “Now that we’re able to operate at our full capacity, we’re able to have a more powerful assault.”\nIn a two-pronged attack, aircraft have ramped up dousing the fires from the air while firefighters and bulldozers starve them of fuel on the ground. At times earlier in the week, planes had to be grounded because of the severity of the wind.\n“I would say [the tide] is turning,” says Ken Pimlott, former director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. “Today and tomorrow are really the key windows to get through, the red flag fire weather conditions. Then I think we’ll start to see much more progress.”\nMassive fires began clawing through the Los Angeles metropolitan area on Tuesday thanks to a combination of long-standing drought and a bout of strong Santa Ana winds, seasonal air that blows from the high desert of Nevada and Utah into Southern California.\nThe Palisades Fire east of Malibu, which has burned almost 20,000 acres, was 0 percent contained on Thursday. Celebrities like Billy Crystal and Paris Hilton were among the many people who had lost their homes. The Eaton Fire in Pasadena, roughly 25 miles to the east, was also uncontained, but the fire department has been able to slow its growth. The Sunset Fire that started in the Hollywood Hills on Wednesday was quickly hemmed in, and two others are partially contained.\n“The only fire that has that potential [to grow] is Palisades, and we have 1,100 people on that,” Stewart says.\nThe key factor has been the winds of up to 99 miles per hour. They’ve been raking down from the northeast to the southwest, fanning the flames and throwing burning embers half a mile in front of the main fire. Canyons running largely the same direction have funneled and intensified that movement of air, creating what Pimlott called a “blowtorch” that spread the Palisades Fire. The flames have been essentially unstoppable.\n“These pressurized winds literally explode out of these canyons,” says Janet Upton, former deputy director of Cal Fire. “All you can do is work to get anything with a heartbeat out of the way.”\nBut the winds began easing up on Wednesday and Thursday. They were anticipated to reach 15 to 20 miles per hour Thursday afternoon, before ticking up to 30 to 40 miles per hour on Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Firefighters that were helpless against virtually unstoppable wind-driven blazes have been able to return to their normal tactics.\n“With those winds being very calm this morning, I believe we can actually make some progress, turn a corner, and start to build some containment on these fires,” Brent Pascua, a Cal Fire battalion chief, told The Today Show on Thursday.\nSo far the disaster response has been marred by disinformation and controversy. After some fire hydrants ran dry, president-elect Donald Trump baselessly accused California governor Gavin Newsom of mismanaging the state’s water supplies to save an endangered fish.\nCity employees have now been able to reach three water tanks on hills near the Palisades Fire to turn up the pressure. That allows the tanks to be refilled more quickly so they can keep supplying the hydrants, Stewart says. Each tank can hold 1 million gallons. “We have full flowing hydrants,” she says.\nMore firefighters have begun to arrive from Utah, Oregon, Arizona, Washington, and New Mexico. Several dozen task forces are on their way, according to Stewart, each with five fire engines plus a command vehicle.\nAircraft began flying again on Wednesday. Twelve helicopters are filling humongous water buckets hanging from cables and sucking seawater up through snorkels. Six planes are also working the fires, including a pair of “super scoop” aircraft that have been skimming across the surface of the Pacific to pick up water. The helicopters and scoop planes dump water on spot fires, letting firefighters close in and extinguish them.\nMeanwhile, other airplanes are dropping fire retardant out ahead of the inferno, coating potential fuel with a layer of nonflammable chemicals and slowing its advance. A C-130 cargo plane that Cal Fire acquired from the Coast Guard and retrofitted this summer can dump 4,000 gallons of retardant. That buys time for firefighters to dig and bulldoze firebreaks of bare soil.\nWith the ocean constraining the Palisades Fire to the south, responders will try to prevent it from breaking out to the east or west. “The real spread is going to be on the flank,” Pimlott says.\nA red flag warning for increased fire risk will remain through Friday, with humidity at only 8–12 percent. California has been suffering an abnormally dry winter, with 40 percent of the state under drought conditions.\n“Fuels remain critically dry,” James Magana of Cal Fire said at a Thursday morning briefing. “You can expect to see critical rates of spread, especially on those ridgetops or those drainages that are in alignment with the wind.”\nOn Saturday, the winds are expected to reverse direction. If firefighters aren’t ready, the heel of the fire could become the front and run off to the north.\nEven once they’re able to contain the conflagration within a circle of firebreaks and natural barriers, that won’t be the end of the task.

    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\">“With those winds being very calm this morning, I believe we can actually make some progress, turn a corner, and start to build some containment on these fires,” Brent Pascua, a Cal Fire battalion chief, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcK-Yubzj7w\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> <em>The Today Show</em> on Thursday.</p><p class=\"paywall\">So far the disaster response has been marred by disinformation and controversy. After some fire hydrants ran dry, president-elect Donald Trump baselessly accused California governor Gavin Newsom of mismanaging the state’s water supplies to save an endangered fish.</p><p class=\"paywall\">City employees have now been able to reach three water tanks on hills near the Palisades Fire to turn up the pressure. That allows the tanks to be refilled more quickly so they can keep supplying the hydrants, Stewart says. Each tank can hold 1 million gallons. “We have full flowing hydrants,” she says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">More firefighters have begun to arrive from Utah, Oregon, Arizona, Washington, and New Mexico. Several dozen task forces are on their way, according to Stewart, each with five fire engines plus a command vehicle.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Aircraft began flying again on Wednesday. Twelve helicopters are filling humongous water buckets hanging from cables and sucking seawater up through snorkels. Six planes are also working the fires, including a pair of “super scoop” aircraft that have been skimming across the surface of the Pacific to pick up water. The helicopters and scoop planes dump water on spot fires, letting firefighters close in and extinguish them.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Meanwhile, other airplanes are dropping fire retardant out ahead of the inferno, coating potential fuel with a layer of nonflammable chemicals and slowing its advance. A C-130 cargo plane that Cal Fire acquired from the Coast Guard and retrofitted this summer can dump 4,000 gallons of retardant. That buys time for firefighters to dig and bulldoze firebreaks of bare soil.</p><p class=\"paywall\">With the ocean constraining the Palisades Fire to the south, responders will try to prevent it from breaking out to the east or west. “The real spread is going to be on the flank,” Pimlott says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A red flag warning for increased fire risk will remain through Friday, with humidity at only 8–12 percent. California has been suffering an abnormally dry winter, with 40 percent of the state under drought conditions.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“Fuels remain critically dry,” James Magana of Cal Fire <a href=\"https://youtu.be/GpWybf8tIeU?t=828\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> at a Thursday morning briefing. “You can expect to see critical rates of spread, especially on those ridgetops or those drainages that are in alignment with the wind.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">On Saturday, the winds are expected to reverse direction. If firefighters aren’t ready, the heel of the fire could become the front and run off to the north.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Even once they’re able to contain the conflagration within a circle of firebreaks and natural barriers, that won’t be the end of the task. Firefighters will have to stamp out smaller fires within that footprint.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“That’s a critical stage, to mop up these hot spots or anything that could rekindle if the winds were to increase again,” Upton says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Moving forward, the city will need to clean up debris, restore utilities, and analyze damage to the environment before allowing people to move back.

    "content_text": "If the rumors are to be believed, the run-up to Nintendo’s (presumed) Switch 2 announcement has been leakier than an old apartment faucet. Over the past few weeks, information about the console’s dock, retailer accessory SKUs, mock-ups, Joy-Cons, and so much more, have found their way online; the sheer volume of alleged photos and information suggests that an announcement may be right around the corner.\nNintendo, however, remains steadfast in its silence. While fans online may speculate why the company hasn’t given in and made an announcement about the Switch 2 itself, the leaks might not actually make a difference in its sales, marketing, or anything else of material consequence. “None of these leaks will matter in the slightest once the official reveal is made,” says Circana executive director and video game analyst Mat Piscatella.\nIn other words, this isn’t the iPhone 4. Nothing that’s surfaced has revealed a console wildly different than the one before. Nintendo’s plans to release a next-gen Switch—commonly referred to as the Switch 2—have been floating around since early last year. Company president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed that Nintendo would announce the console before March 2025, when the company’s fiscal year ends. “It is a very different story when material, nonpublic information is leaked,” Piscatella says. “But the extent of the impact of that can vary greatly depending on the nature of the leak. That would all have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.”\nIf anything, the bulk of the buzz about the Switch 2 stems from hardcore fan fixation rather than tech specs. Sure, some folks are interested in how good the console’s resolution will be, but many are just excited about what new games, and new styles of gameplay, will come with a fresh new unit. People get emotional about consoles, and Nintendo’s are some of the most beloved. What’s been happening the last few weeks isn’t so much a big spill of corporate secrets as it is the same kind of energy and speculation that surrounds a Beyoncé album drop. Once Nintendo reveals the new Switch, this will all just have been a part of the hype cycle.\nNot that it hasn’t been a wickedly fun hype cycle. In addition to images leaked on sites like X and Reddit, there have also been “summoning circles” constructed to call forth the Switch 2. Some folks have even made jokes about the situation, riffing on “leaked” images of screws or air that might be used for the new console.\nAnd of course, leaks have to be seen by the audience to even matter. For many Nintendo fans, it’s doubtful they’ll find details about the Switch 2 on Reddit, as opposed to in TV commercials or stores. Even as gaming sites like Kotaku fret about whether the leaks point to a less-than-spectacular console, average players aren’t so concerned. No device has ever pleased everyone, and analyzing grainy photos won’t change that.\nNot that that’s stopped online fans from poring over every scrap of information. After Nintendo’s Twitter account banner was updated to a photo of Mario and Luigi gesturing to … nothing, squabbles started among some fans looking to figure out if it was a tease or a red herring. Another official tweet promoting a Lego Game Boy sparked a flurry of comments about the Switch 2, including some accusing Nintendo of trolling. “The online conversation has been ... enthusiastic,” Piscatella says. “Which is generally a good thing as it shows a high level of interest from parts of the gaming audience.”\nStill, some fans are pondering the same question: With so much information already available, why hasn’t Nintendo just announced the thing? Former Nintendo PR manager Krysta Yang offered some insight on X. “As wild as these leaks are, Nintendo is going to stick to their plan,” Yang tweeted. “They have a date in mind, and they are not budging no matter what.”",

    "content_text": "A newly discovered cell type could transform how plastic surgeries are performed—from facial reconstructions to nose jobs.\nCartilage transplants are central to many procedures, being used to fix cleft palates, correct missing or misshapen ears, or to repair damage to someone’s larynx caused by cancer. They’re also common in elective nose augmentations.\nBut the results aren’t always stellar. Surgeons often resort to transferring cartilage from the rib, which is stiff, or using silicone implants, with neither material matching the real thing. Implanted tissues are not flexible in the same way as those they’re implanted into, and don’t become part of the natively occurring tissue. “They often do not integrate, and they move around,” says Maksim Plikus, a cell biologist at UC Irvine. “The nose gets crooked and needs another revision.”\nHowever a newly defined tissue that lurks within flexible parts of animals’ bodies could change this. Dubbed lipocartilage, it was noticed by Plikus and his team for the first time while studying mouse ears over a decade ago. The cells staring back at Plikus through the microscope were distinctly fattier than the cells that usually forge cartilage, known as chondrocytes. Perhaps they were fat cells, known as “adipocytes,” he thought.\n“They’re big. They’re filled with lipids. They look like a pearl—whitish, and iridescent under the microscope. That’s an adipocyte,” Plikus recalls thinking—until a pang of dissonance struck him. The tissue may resemble fat, but fat cells don’t belong in cartilage. “If somebody starts calling a cat a dog, they’re absolutely wrong. It’s a completely different species,” Plikus says. “Well, this is like a completely different species of cell. To call it an adipocyte is fundamentally wrong.”\nOver the next decade, his team subjected the mysterious cells to a gauntlet of high-tech biological profiles akin to personality tests. They proved that this bouncy connective tissue is neither typical chondrocyte nor adipocyte, according to results published today in Science.\nPlikus calls them lipochondrocytes, or LCs. The cells appear to simultaneously provide structure (like cartilage) and natural squishiness (like fat). They appear in many mammals, including humans, and the unique structure they provide gives reconstructive surgeons a clearer understanding of what materials make up our faces. Plikus believes this new tissue discovery sets the stage for better cartilage transplants—and so better plastic surgery. “The field is really desperate for new ways of making safe, biocompatible human cartilages that are living tissues, not some synthetic silicone implant,” he says.\nDepending on how you count, your body hosts about 400 types of cells that make up dozens of different types of tissue, from skin to salivary glands. Skeletal tissues, like cartilage, are among the simplest, but this new study proves that they’re no less enigmatic. “It goes to show we still don’t understand it very well,” says Justine Lee, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and researcher with UCLA who was not involved in the study. “We’re still finding cool new things. It’s something that could potentially result in future implants that are soft, pliable.”\nSo how could this new cell elude scientists and doctors for so long? In a way, it didn’t. Plikus and his graduate student scoured centuries of scientific papers for any lost trace of fatty cartilage. They found a clue in a German book from 1854 by Franz Leydig, a contemporary of Charles Darwin. “Anything and everything that he could stick under the microscope, he did,” Plikus says. Leydig’s book described fat-like cells in a sample of cartilage from rat ears. But 19th-century tools couldn’t expand beyond that observation, and, realizing that a more accurate census of skeletal tissue might be valuable for medicine, Plikus resolved to crack the case.\nHis team began their investigation by looking at the cartilage that’s sandwiched between thin layers of mouse ear skin. A green dye that preferentially stains fatty molecules revealed a network of squishy blobs. They isolated these lipid-filled cells and analyzed their contents. All of your cells contain the same library of genes, but those genes aren’t always activated. Which genes did these cells express? What proteins slush around inside? That data revealed that lipochondrocytes actually look very different, molecularly, from fat cells.\nThey next questioned how lipochondrocytes behave. Fat cells have an unmistakable function in the body: storing energy. When your body stores up energy, cellular stores of lipids swell; when your body burns fat, the cells shrink. Lipochondrocytes, it turned out, do no such thing. The researchers studied ears of mice put on high-fat versus calorie-restricted diets. Despite rapidly gaining or losing weight, the lipochondrocytes in the ears didn’t change.\n“That immediately suggested they must have a completely different role that has nothing to do with metabolism,” Plikus says. “It has to be structural.”\nLipochondrocytes are like balloons filled with vegetable oil. They’re soft and amorphous but still resist compression. This contributes meaningfully to the structural properties of cartilage. Based on data from rodents, the tensile strength, resilience, and stiffness of cartilage increased 77 to 360 percent when comparing cartilage tissue with and without lipochondrocytes—suggesting that these cells make cartilage more pliable.\nAnd the structural gifts appear to benefit all sorts of species. In the outer ear of Pallas’ long-tongued bat, for example, lipocartilage underlies a series of ruffles that scientists believe attunes them to precise wavelengths of sound.\nThe team have discovered lipochondrocytes in human fetal cartilage, as well. And Lee says this discovery seems to finally explain something that reconstructive surgeons commonly observe: “Cartilage always has a little bit of slipperiness to it,” she says, especially in young children. “You can feel it, you can see it. It’s very obvious.”\nThe new findings suggest that lipochondrocytes fine-tune the biomechanics of some of our cartilage. A rigid scaffold of cartilage proteins without lipids is more durable and is used for building weight-bearing joints in your neck, back, and—yes, you got it—the ribs, one of the traditional sources of cartilage for implants. “But when it comes to more intricate things that actually need to be pliable, bouncy, elastic—ears, nose tip, the larynx,” Plikus says, that’s where the lipocartilage shines.\nFor procedures that involve modifying these parts of the body, Plikus one day envisions growing lipocartilage organoids in a dish and 3D-printing them in any desired shape. Lee, though, urges caution: “Despite 30 or 40 years of study, we’re not very good at making complex tissues,” she says.\nThough an operation like that is far off, the study suggests it’s feasible to grow lipochondrocytes from embryonic stem cells and isolate them safely for a transplant. Lee figures that regulators wouldn’t green-light using embryonic cells to grow tissue for a non-life-threatening condition, but says she’d be more optimistic if the researchers can grow transplantable tissue from patient-derived adult cells. (Plikus says a new patent application he has filed covers using stem cells from adult tissue.)\nLipochondrocytes update our understanding of how cartilage should look and feel—and why. “When we’re trying to build, say, the nose, sometimes we could use the [lipid-filled cells] for a little bit of padding.” Lee says. Lipocartilage could one day fill that void as a growable, transplantable tissue—or it could inspire better biomimicking materials. “It could be both,” she says. “It’s exciting to think about. Maybe that’s one thing that we’ve been missing.”",

Plikus and his graduate student scoured centuries of scientific papers for any lost trace of fatty cartilage. They found a clue in a German book from 1854 by Franz Leydig, a contemporary of Charles Darwin. “Anything and everything that he could stick under the microscope, he did,” Plikus says. Leydig’s book described fat-like cells in a sample of cartilage from rat ears. But 19th-century tools couldn’t expand beyond that observation, and, realizing that a more accurate census of skeletal tissue might be valuable for medicine, Plikus resolved to crack the case.</p><p class=\"paywall\">His team began their investigation by looking at the cartilage that’s sandwiched between thin layers of mouse ear skin.

    "content_text": "Meta just lost a major fight in its ongoing legal battle with a group of authors suing the company for copyright infringement over how it trained its artificial intelligence models. Against the company’s wishes, a court unredacted information alleging that Meta used Library Genesis (LibGen), a notorious so-called shadow library of pirated books that originated in Russia, to help train its generative AI language models.\nThe case, Kadrey et al. v. Meta Platforms, was one of the earliest copyright lawsuits filed against a tech company over its AI training practices. Its outcome, along with those of dozens of similar cases working their way through courts in the United States, will determine whether technology companies can legally use creative works to train AI moving forward and could either entrench AI’s most powerful players or derail them.\nVince Chhabria, a judge for the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, ordered both Meta and the plaintiffs on Wednesday to file full versions of a batch of documents after calling Meta’s approach to redacting them “preposterous,” adding that, for the most part, \"there is not a single thing in those briefs that should be sealed.” Chhabria ruled that Meta was not pushing to redact the materials in order to protect its business interests but instead to “avoid negative publicity.” The documents were originally filed late last year remained publicly unavailable in unredacted form until now.\nIn his order, Chhabria referenced an internal quote from a Meta employee, included in the documents, in which they speculated, “If there is media coverage suggesting we have used a dataset we know to be pirated, such as LibGen, this may undermine our negotiating position with regulators on these issues.” Meta declined to comment.\nNovelists Richard Kadrey and Christopher Golden, along with comedian Sarah Silverman, first filed the class-action lawsuit against Meta in July 2023, alleging the tech giant trained its language models using their copyrighted work without permission. Meta has argued that using publicly available materials to train AI tools is shielded by the “fair use” doctrine, which holds that using copyrighted works without permission is legal in certain cases, one of which, the company argues, is “using text to statistically model language and generate original expression,” the company’s lawyers wrote in a motion to dismiss the authors’ lawsuit in November 2023. In this particular lawsuit, Meta has also argued that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.\nBefore these documents were made public, Meta previously disclosed in a research paper that it had trained its Llama large language model on portions of Books3, a dataset of around 196,000 books scraped from the internet. It had not previously publicly indicated, however, that it had torrented data directly from LibGen.\nThese newly unredacted documents reveal exchanges between Meta employees unearthed in the discovery process, like a Meta engineer telling a colleague that they hesitated to access LibGen data because “torrenting from a [Meta-owned] corporate laptop doesn’t feel right 😃”. They also allege that internal discussions about using LibGen data were escalated to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg (referred to as \"MZ\" in the memo handed over during discovery) and that Meta's AI team was \"approved to use\" the pirated material.\n“Meta has treated the so-called ‘public availability’ of shadow datasets as a get-out-of-jail-free card, notwithstanding that internal Meta records show every relevant decision-maker at Meta, up to and including its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, knew LibGen was ‘a dataset we know to be pirated,’” the plaintiffs allege in this motion. (Originally filed in late 2024, the motion is a request to file a third amended complaint.)\nIn addition to the plaintiffs’ briefs, another filing was unredacted in response to Chhabria’s order—Meta’s opposition to the motion to file an amended complaint. It argues that the authors’ attempts to add additional claims to the case are an “eleventh-hour gambit based on a false and inflammatory premise” and denies that Meta waited to reveal crucial information in discovery. Instead, Meta argues it first revealed to the plaintiffs that it used a LibGen dataset in July 2024. (Because much of the discovery materials remain confidential, it is difficult for WIRED to confirm that claim.)\nMeta’s argument hinges on its claim that the plaintiffs already knew about the LibGen use and shouldn’t be granted additional time to file a third amended claim when they had ample time to do so before discovery ended in December 2024. “Plaintiffs knew of Meta’s downloading and use of LibGen and other alleged ‘shadow libraries’ since at least mid-July 2024,” the tech giant’s lawyers argue.\nIn November 2023, Chhabria granted Meta’s motion to dismiss some of the lawsuit’s claims, including its claim Meta’s alleged use of the authors’ work to train AI violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a US law introduced in 1998 to stop people from selling or duplicating copyrighted works on the internet. At the time, the judge agreed with Meta’s stance that the plaintiffs had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that the company had removed what’s known as “copyright management information,” like the author’s name and title of the work.\nThe unredacted documents argue that the plaintiffs should be allowed to amend their complaint, alleging that the information Meta revealed is evidence that the DMCA claim was warranted. They also say the discovery process has unearthed reasons to add new allegations. “Meta, through a corporate representative who testified on November 20, 2024, has now admitted under oath to uploading (aka ‘seeding’) pirated files containing Plaintiffs’ works on ‘torrent’ sites,” the motion alleges. (Seeding is when torrented files are then shared with other peers after they have finished downloading.)\n“This torrenting activity turned Meta itself into a distributor of the very same pirated copyrighted material that it was also downloading for use in its commercially available AI models,” one of the newly unredacted documents claims, alleging that Meta, in other words, had not just used copyrighted material without permission but also disseminated it.\nLibGen, an archive of books uploaded to the internet that originated in Russia around 2008, is one of the largest and most controversial “shadow libraries” in the world. In 2015, a New York judge ordered a preliminary injunction against the site, a measure designed in theory to temporarily shut the archive down, but its anonymous administrators simply switched its domain. In September 2024, a different New York judge ordered LibGen to pay $30 million to the rights holders for infringing on their copyrights, despite not knowing who actually operates the piracy hub.\nMeta’s discovery woes for this case aren’t over, either. In the same order, Chhabria warned the tech giant against any overly sweeping redaction requests in the future: “If Meta again submits an unreasonably broad sealing request, all materials will simply be unsealed,” he wrote.",

    "content_text": "On Thursday, Elon Musk agreed with the leader of a far-right German political party that Adolf Hitler was a communist and that left-wing groups who support Palestinian causes have more in common with Nazis than with her own party.\nThe deeply weird and disinformation-filled conversation between Musk and Alice Weidel, the leader of Alternative for Germany (AfD), took place on X. It came after weeks of Musk’s efforts to boost the far-right party, which has deep links to neo-Nazism and has been surveilled for suspected extremism by Germany’s own intelligence services.\n“[Hitler] was a communist, and he considered himself as a socialist,” Weidel said in response to Musk asking about media reports linking the AfD to Nazism.\n“The biggest success after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right[-wing] and conservative, he was exactly the opposite,” Weidel said. “He wasn't a conservative, he wasn't a libertarian, he was a communist, socialist guy, and we are the opposite.”\n“Right,” Musk responded.\nIn his autobiography Mein Kampf, Hitler—who as leader of the German Reich was responsible for the invasion of the Soviet Union and the enslavement and death of millions of its citizens—repeatedly describes communism as an enemy of the German nation. He believed that Marxism was a Jewish conspiracy to control Germany and the world.\nWeidel also compared the Nazi Party’s views to those of modern-day left-wing political groups who support Palestine in the face of what a UN commission has called crimes against humanity conducted by Israel. While her AfD colleagues were last month seen attending a secretive meeting organized by former members of a militant neo-Nazi group known for burning the Israeli flag, she said, “The AfD is the only protector of the Jewish people here in Germany.”\nWeidel is the AfD’s candidate for chancellor in Germany’s snap elections, which take place next month. As someone who previously worked in finance and lives in Switzerland with her wife, who is from Sri Lanka, and their children, she has been presented as a relatively moderate face for the party.\nThis is something Musk picked up on in an op-ed he penned last month for a German newspaper.\n\"The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka,” Musk wrote. “Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!”\nAhead of the conversation on Thursday, the EU said that it would be monitoring the event to see if it was artificially promoted to voters in Germany, something which would be in violation of the region’s sweeping Digital Service Act rules. A European Commission spokesperson told WIRED it would not be commenting on the contents of the livestream.\nWeidel referenced the EU’s preoccupation with the conversation, claiming 150 officials at the EU commission were listening in, then claimed the DSA was a censorship tool, before adding: “You know what Adolf Hitler did? He switched off free speech. He controlled the media, and without that he would have never been successful.”\n“Yes, exactly,” Musk responded.\nThe conversation, which was billed as an interview but was more of a love-in, hit virtually event major culture war topic, from the war in Ukraine, where Weidel suggested European government’s lack of strategy would push Russia toward nuclear war, to immigration, where Musk wildly claimed that “on the Mexican side of the border in the US is a giant pile of discarded passports and drivers’ licenses, like a huge pile.”\nIt was unclear what Musk was talking about, and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMusk also claimed that “basically theft is legal in California” and said that the only thing that would slow down what “the influx of criminals” were stealing is “if your back hurts from carrying out all the goods.”\nThe centibillionaire’s interest in German politics, and the AfD in particular, appear to have been largely informed by a single X user, Naomi Seibt, a 24-year-old German influencer who rose to prominence by posting climate change and Covid-19 denial content.\nAfter she posted an image of herself in June saying she had voted for the AfD in last year’s European elections, Musk shared her post, asking: “Why is there such a negative reaction from some about AfD?”\nHe then slid into her DMs, Seibt told Reuters. \"I explained to him the AfD is not similar to the Nazi ideology or Hitler but is like the 19th century liberal nationalist movement ... because they wanted to be free from authoritarians in their own territory,\" Seibt told the outlet.\nMusk engaged with the 24-year-old 40 more times before sharing one of her posts on December 20 with the comment: “Only the AfD can save Germany.” A week later an op-ed with Musk’s byline appeared in the German Welt am Samstag newspaper claiming that the AfD was the “last spark of hope” for Germany.\nMusk repeated his endorsement during the livestream, saying, “I think Alice Weidel is a very reasonable person, and hopefully people can tell just from this conversation. Nothing outrageous is being proposed, just common sense.”\nIt’s unclear whether Musk’s endorsement of Weidel and the AfD will have any material impact on the outcome of the election.\n“In the first survey we conducted this year, we found that this has not yet benefited the AfD,” Manfred Güllner, the head of the Forsa Institute, told Politico. “I don’t see very much potential for future change, because Musk has become a negative figure.”",

    "content_text": "Some of the world’s most popular apps are likely being co-opted by rogue members of the advertising industry to harvest sensitive location data on a massive scale, with that data ending up with a location data company whose subsidiary has previously sold global location data to US law enforcement.\nThe thousands of apps, included in hacked files from location data company Gravy Analytics, include everything from games like Candy Crush and dating apps like Tinder to pregnancy tracking and religious prayer apps across both Android and iOS. Because much of the collection is occurring through the advertising ecosystem—not code developed by the app creators themselves—this data collection is likely happening without users’ or even app developers’ knowledge.\n“For the first time publicly, we seem to have proof that one of the largest data brokers selling to both commercial and government clients appears to be acquiring their data from the online advertising ‘bid stream,’” rather than code embedded into the apps themselves, Zach Edwards, senior threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Silent Push and who has followed the location data industry closely, tells 404 Media after reviewing some of the data.\nThe data provides a rare glimpse inside the world of real-time bidding (RTB). Historically, location data firms paid app developers to include bundles of code that collected the location data of their users. Many companies have turned instead to sourcing location information through the advertising ecosystem, where companies bid to place ads inside apps. But a side effect is that data brokers can listen in on that process and harvest the location of peoples’ mobile phones.\n“This is a nightmare scenario for privacy, because not only does this data breach contain data scraped from the RTB systems, but there's some company out there acting like a global honey badger, doing whatever it pleases with every piece of data that comes its way,” Edwards says.\nIncluded in the hacked Gravy data are tens of millions of mobile phone coordinates of devices inside the US, Russia, and Europe. Some of those files also reference an app next to each piece of location data. 404 Media extracted the app names and built a list of mentioned apps.\nThe list includes dating sites Tinder and Grindr; massive games such as Candy Crush, Temple Run, Subway Surfers, and Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells; transit app Moovit; My Period Calendar & Tracker, a period-tracking app with more than 10 million downloads; popular fitness app MyFitnessPal; social network Tumblr; Yahoo’s email client; Microsoft’s 365 office app; and flight tracker Flightradar24. The list also mentions multiple religious-focused apps such as Muslim prayer and Christian Bible apps, various pregnancy trackers, and many VPN apps, which some users may download, ironically, in an attempt to protect their privacy.\nThe full list can be found here. Multiple security researchers have published other lists of apps included in the data, of varying sizes. Our version is relatively larger because it includes both Android and iOS apps, and we decided to keep duplicate instances of the same app that had slight name variations to make it easier for readers to search for apps they have installed.\nAlthough this dataset came from an apparent hack of Gravy, it is not clear whether Gravy collected this location data itself or sourced it from another company, or which location company ultimately owns it or is licensed to use it.\nMuch of the location data attached to these app names does not have a time stamp. But there are indications it dates from 2024. One of the apps listed is Call of Duty: Mobile, and specifically its Season 5 iteration, which launched in May 2024.\nGravy is a company that powers much of the rest of the location data industry. It collates mobile phone location data from various sources, then sells that to commercial companies or, through its subsidiary Venntel, to US government agencies. Norwegian outlet NRK and I previously revealed the flow of location data from a handful of ordinary apps to Gravy and then to Venntel. Venntel’s clients have included Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, the IRS, the FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.\nVenntel has also provided the underlying data for another government-bought surveillance tool called Locate X. 404 Media and a group of other outlets showed last year how that tool, made by a company called Babel Street, could be used to monitor visitors to out-of-state abortion clinics.\nBut the newly hacked data shows for the first time just how many apps could be part of a location data supply chain, even if their developers are not aware of it. Most app developers and companies included in the list did not respond to a request for comment. Flightradar24 said in an email that it had never heard of Gravy, but that it does display ads, which “help keep Flightradar24 free.”\nTinder said in an email that “Tinder takes safety and security very seriously. We have no relationship with Gravy Analytics and have no evidence that this data was obtained from the Tinder app” but did not answer questions about ads inside the app.\nMuslim Pro, one of the Muslim prayer apps included in the list, said in an email that it was not aware of Gravy. “Yes, we display ads through several ad networks to support the free version of the app. However, as mentioned above, we do not authorize these networks to collect location data of our users,” the email said. That does not necessarily mean that a member of the advertising ecosystem can’t extract such data, though. (In 2020 I revealed Muslim Pro was selling its users’ location data to a company called X-Mode, whose clients included US military contractors; Muslim Pro stopped the practice after my reporting.)\nA Grindr spokesperson told 404 Media in an email that “Grindr has never worked with or provided data to Gravy Analytics. We do not share data with data aggregators or brokers and have not shared geolocation with ad partners for many years. Transparency is at the core of our privacy program, therefore the third parties and service providers we work with are listed here on our website.” Grindr was previously found to have allowed data brokers to obtain its users’ location data.\nIt’s important that the data appears to be sourced through real-time bidding, because that dictates who is responsible (rogue members of the advertising industry and the tech giants that facilitate that industry), how users can protect themselves (attempting to block ads), and the fact that massive app publishers may not even be aware their users’ data is being harvested and therefore might not know how to stop it. An app developer will know if it implemented location-data-gathering code itself. It might not know that some company, somewhere, is silently listening in on the advertising process and siphoning data from their app.\nSurveillance firms can obtain RTB data by acquiring ad tech companies and posing as prospective advertisers. The spy-run location data company doesn’t need to successfully place an ad; instead, it is able to gather data on devices by simply being plugged into that industry. Location data in this case can also include a users’ IP address, which is then geolocated to give their coarse location.\nLast January, 404 Media reported on an Israeli surveillance company called Patternz, which was sourcing masses of location data through the RTB process.\nIn an exposed training video, Patternz showed some of the popular apps it got location data from: 9GAG, Kik, sports app FUTBIN, caller ID apps such as CallApp and Truecaller; and various word, sudoku, and solitaire puzzle games. Every one of these apps are also in the Gravy data. This suggests that Gravy, or wherever Gravy got that data from, also sourced it from interacting with the advertising system rather than location-tracking code baked into the apps.\n404 Media shared some of the location data with another security researcher with knowledge of the advertising and location data industries. “It appears that at least some of this data would likely have been sourced from advertising related, real-time bidding,” Krzysztof Franaszek, founder of Adalytics, a digital forensics firm, told 404 Media after reviewing the data. He pointed out some of the user-agents in the file, which show how a user’s device connected to a service, referenced “afma-sdk.” That is a string used by Google’s Mobile Ads SDK (software development kit). In other words, in some cases, it is Google’s advertising platform that is delivering the ads that are eventually leading to this tracking by outside companies and potentially government contractors.\nGoogle did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. Neither did Apple.\nFranaszek also says that “a significant amount of this geolocation dataset appears to be inferred by IP address to geolocation lookups, meaning the vendor or their source is deriving the user's geolocation by checking their IP address rather than by using GNSS [Global Navigation Satellite System]/GPS data. That would suggest that the data is not being sourced entirely from a location data SDK.”\n“What we’re seeing here in this data appears to me to be a huge diversity of apps,” Edwards says. “That’s not what you see from an SDK ingestion; that’s what you see from bulk RTB ingestions.”\nIn December the Federal Trade Commission banned another location data company called Mobilewalla from collecting consumer data “from online advertising auctions for purposes other than participating in those auctions.” In other words, the agency banned Mobilewalla from participating in the RTB process for building datasets on peoples’ devices. The FTC also said Venntel and Gravy collected data without obtaining user consent, ordered the company to delete historical location data, and banned it from selling data related to sensitive areas like health clinics and places of worship, except in “limited circumstances” involving national security or law enforcement.\n404 Media has verified the hacked Gravy data in various ways. Some files include credentials for Gravy’s Snowflake instances, a data warehousing tool. 404 Media checked that the URLs in the hacked files do correspond to real Snowflake instances. One file called “users” contains a long list of companies. Some of these firms denied having any relationship with Gravy; Cuebiq, another location data firm mentioned in the file, told 404 Media it “routinely evaluates available data in the market to determine if they are an appropriate fit for our business. Most do not make it past the evaluation stage to production, as was the case here. Cuebiq tested a limited data sample, which was never made available to our customers, and the data was deleted at the end of the limited trial.”\n404 Media also sent a section of the data to another data broker called Datonics. “We investigated the matter described in your email, and the segment IDs in those files are those of Gravy, not Datonics,” the company said in an email.\nUnacast, which merged with Gravy in 2023, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, both on the hack and whether it or any of its suppliers have derived location data from the real-time bidding process.",

    "content_text": "Over the past decade, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton has wielded his office’s significant resources to investigate well-known tech giants including Google and Meta over how they moderate content and treat rivals. He helped win settlements against Apple for allegedly misleading users and is suing TikTok for allegedly endangering children's privacy. Now, Paxton’s latest tech investigation includes an expansive number of targets, WIRED has learned.\nRumble, Quora, and WeChat are among the 15 companies from which Texas has demanded answers by next week about their collection and use of data of people under 18 years old. Paxton announced the investigation in a press release last month but named only four of the companies being probed—Character.AI, Reddit, Instagram, and Discord. WIRED obtained the names of additional targeted companies through a public records request. They also include Kick, Kik, Pinterest, Telegram, Twitch, Tumblr, WhatsApp, and Whisper.\nPaxton’s office did not respond to requests for comment, including about how it chose which businesses to investigate. But the variety of companies questioned highlights the sprawling reach of a new Texas law aimed at increasing oversight of minors’ use of social media and chat services.\nThree experts in youth privacy regulations who have been following Paxton’s enforcement efforts say the new investigation should be treated credibly, and they believe it could result in companies agreeing to improve their practices. The alternative could be up to hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties per company. “When you bring all the statutes together, Texas has a pretty significant hammer,” says Paul Singer, a partner and section chair at the law firm Kelley Drye & Warren.\nSpokespeople for Character.AI and Tumblr say they take safety issues seriously. Meta and WeChat declined to comment. Other companies under investigation did not respond to requests for comment.\nPaxton launched his probe three days after the families of an 11-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy in Texas sued chatbot startup Character.AI, claiming the company designed its product in an unsafe way that exposed the kids to sexualized and violent responses. In October, a similar case was filed in Florida by the family of a 14-year-old who shot himself to death allegedly following conversations with a Character.AI chatbot. Character.AI later introduced an experience aimed at kids and plans to roll out parental controls.\nOther services under investigation including Kik, Instagram, and Discord have faced public scrutiny over their use by children. But less so WeChat, a messaging app popular among Chinese Americans, and Quora, a forum for crowdsourcing information that’s recently expanded into AI chatbots.\nPaxton’s interest in Rumble, a YouTube-like website popular among US conservative political commentators, is also perhaps unexpected given his track record of partisan views about social media companies. Rumble has touted itself as a haven for free expression, unlike platforms that engage in allegedly heavier content moderation. Paxton is a Republican and has criticized platforms that unfairly silence Texans.\nThe privacy experts who spoke with WIRED described Rumble, Quora, and WeChat as unusual suspects but declined to speculate on the rationale behind their inclusion in the investigation. Josh Golin, executive director of the nonprofit Fairplay, which advocates for digital safety for kids, says concerns aren’t always obvious. Few advocacy groups worried about Pinterest, for example, until the case of a British teen who died from self-harm following exposure to sensitive content on the platform, he says.\nPaxton’s press release last month called his new investigation “a critical step toward ensuring that social media and AI companies comply with our laws designed to protect children from exploitation and harm.”\nThe United States Congress has never passed a comprehensive privacy law, and it hasn’t significantly updated child online safety rules in a quarter century. That has left state lawmakers and regulators to play a big role.\nPaxton’s investigation centers on compliance with Texas’ Securing Children Online through Parental Empowerment Act, or SCOPE, which went into effect in September. It applies to any website or app with social media or chat functions and that registers users under the age of 18, making it more expansive than the federal law, which covers only services catering to under-13 users.\nSCOPE requires services to ask for users’ age and provide parents or guardians power over kids’ account settings and user data. Companies also are barred from selling information gathered about minors without parental permission. In October, Paxton sued TikTok for allegedly violating the law by providing inadequate parental controls and disclosing data without consent. TikTok has denied the allegations.\nThe investigation announced last month also referenced the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, or TDPSA, which became effective in July and requires parental consent before processing data about users younger than 13. Paxton’s office has asked the companies being investigated to detail their compliance with both the SCOPE Act and the TDPSA, according to legal demands obtained through the public records request.\nIn total, companies must answer eight questions by next week, including the number of Texas minors they count as users and have barred for registering an inaccurate birthdate. Lists of whom minors’ data is sold or shared with have to be turned over. Whether any companies have already responded to the demand couldn’t be learned.\nTech company lobbying groups are challenging the constitutionality of SCOPE Act in court. In August, they secured an initial and partial victory when a federal judge in Austin, Texas, ruled that a provision requiring companies to take steps to prevent minors from seeing self-harm and abusive content was too vague.\nBut even a complete win might not be a salve for tech companies. States including Maryland and New York are expected to enforce similar laws starting later this year, says Ariel Fox Johnson, an attorney and principal of the consultancy Digital Smarts Law & Policy. And state attorneys general could resort to pursuing narrower cases under their tried-and-true laws barring deceptive business practices. “What we see is often information gets shared or sold or disclosed in ways families didn’t expect or understand,” Johnson says. “As more laws are enacted that create firm requirements, it seems to be becoming more clear that not everybody is in compliance.”",

    "content_text": "TikTok’s day of reckoning in the US has arrived. On Friday, the United States Supreme Court will hear the company’s appeal against its slated nationwide ban, which could come into force in a little more than a week if the company’s efforts fail.\nThe social video app, which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance and is used by around 170 million Americans, has been appealing the ban since US president Joe Biden signed the law underpinning it last year. The Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) states that ByteDance must sell TikTok’s US business to a non-Chinese company by January 19—no buyer has yet been found—or see the app blocked in the US. Donald Trump, who retakes the White House on January 20, publicly originated the idea that ByteDance be forced to sell TikTok during his first presidential term but has since reversed course.\nThe Supreme Court, which is hearing the case quickly due to the impending deadline and following a federal court upholding the ban in December, will determine whether the US Constitution’s First Amendment right to free speech is overruled by the government’s belief that TikTok is a threat to US national security. Proponents of PAFACA claim TikTok’s Chinese ownership could allow China to steal data on Americans and spread disinformation—although little evidence has been presented to support those claims, which the company denies.\nIf the court allows the ban to go ahead—and Trump doesn’t find a way to stop it—the move will be an unprecedented technological clampdown in the country.\n“This is the first time we’ve seen a national-level ban that appears imminent in the United States,” says Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist at the Internet Society. TikTok has been banned or faces lawsuits in other countries, such as India, and the pressures come against the backdrop of total internet shutdowns and increased online censorship. “What we learned from all of those is that this ends up really hurting the people of the country, that the economic effects are immediate for people,” Hall says.\nSo, how would TikTok actually be banned?\nApp Stores, Hosting Providers\nUnpicking TikTok from the nation’s consciousness—thousands of influencers and businesses use the app to make money and promote themselves—is not exactly straightforward. Nor is it simple to untangle the company from US-based internet infrastructure.\nPAFACA doesn’t require anyone to uninstall TikTok from their phones. It also doesn’t say TikTok should directly stop its services from working in the US. Instead, it effectively tries to throttle TikTok by making it harder to use over time and by stopping companies from providing services that help it to keep working and quickly loading videos.\nTikTok, as with all companies mentioned in this story, did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment and hasn’t, at this stage, outlined what technical steps it will or will not take if the ban does eventually come into place.\nThe law says it will be “unlawful” for entities to “distribute, maintain or update” the app including its source code, or by “providing services” that allow it to keep running as it is now. This distribution, maintenance, or updates could be, the law says, by means of mobile app stores that can be accessed in the US or by “providing internet hosting services.”\n“The law really deliberately avoided saying that it was illegal to have the app on your phone,” says Milton Mueller, a professor and cofounder of the Internet Governance Project at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in opposition of the ban. “Their attempt is to say nobody new can download it from the Apple or Google stores, and nobody who has it can update it through those stores,” Mueller says. “There’s nothing in the law that says ‘TikTok you must block US users,’ which is again interesting.”\nIf TikTok is removed from Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store in the US, it will not be possible to directly install new updates that will add new features, fix bugs within the code, or quash security flaws. Over time, that means TikTok will stop functioning properly. Apple didn’t respond to WIRED’s request for comment, while Google declined to comment on what it will do if the law comes into effect.\nThe law’s other focus is on stopping “hosting” companies from providing services to TikTok—and the definition is pretty wide. Hosting companies “may include file hosting, domain name server hosting, cloud hosting, and virtual private server hosting,” the law says. Since the summer of 2022, as TikTok faced pressure about its Chinese ownership, the company has hosted US user data within Oracle’s cloud services. Oracle also did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.\nEven so, other systems such as content delivery networks, advertising networks, payment providers, and more are used as part of TikTok’s infrastructure. The law does not specifically mention these services, but differing legal readings could make them question whether they help to “maintain” or “distribute” TikTok’s fully functioning service.\nHall says a recent test of TikTok’s website showed 185 embedded domains on the page. “They pull in code, content from that array of third-party providers and their own domains too,” he says. “The apps will start to decay and rot as either services stop working, things like content distribution networks or services who feel like they can't take the risks of the ambiguous nature of the language or the potential enforcement by the incoming administration.”\nThere’s one internet infrastructure player that the ban does not specifically put pressure on: internet service providers. Countries such as Russia and China have developed censorship measures that allow them to block entire websites from being accessed through web bowsers. Mueller believes this omission by US lawmakers was likely deliberate, as it avoids setting up a Chinese-style internet firewall. “They knew that a system of ISP-based blocking and filtering would obviously be a form of First Amendment restriction,” he says.\nAvoiding a TikTok Ban\nWhile TikTok’s service in the US would likely degrade over time, there remain some potential ways around any ban—both for individuals and potentially also the company itself. How effective these measures would be likely depends on how motivated people are to keep using TikTok and what the company decides to do.\n“TikTok has 170 million users,” says Alan Rozenshtein, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota, who is in favor of the law but says it is the “best of a bunch of bad options” relating to TikTok. “This law will not prevent every one of them from accessing TikTok. I don’t think that was ever the goal of the law. The law is to make it meaningfully harder to access TikTok.”\nTheoretically, at least, TikTok could shift its services providers—such as hosting companies or content delivery networks—to be based outside of the United States. Using technical infrastructure based abroad, for instance in Europe, could allow TikTok to be served to people in the US while operating within the bounds of the law.\nWhile skirting the full-blown ban would allow people in the US to continue to use the app, that doesn’t mean the experience will be good. If videos are served from international locations, for example, load times may be slower for users, and it may be harder to upload videos. Using TikTok’s website isn’t the same experience as what the app provides, either. And that all depends on such a setup being possible at all.\n“I do think that the number of companies that can do that, that are not headquartered in the US, is going to be small, especially considering how hard it is to switch from one cloud provider to another,” Hall says. “It’s really difficult depending on a number of factors.” Aside from technical challenges, international companies may not be willing to risk flying in the face of US restrictions, particularly under an aggressive Trump administration that has already threatened Greenland and economic penalties on other countries.\nA TikTok ban would almost guarantee a spike in searches and downloads of virtual private networks (VPNs), which allow people to appear as if they are in a different geographic location to get around restrictions on content—for instance, trying to watch Netflix while abroad. Using a VPN within the US may allow the TikTok app to keep working, although it is unclear whether the company will place any restrictions on users it can determine are in the US by other means. The company’s support pages say SIM card registration details and other information can be used to pinpoint someone’s location.\nAlternatively, it is likely Android users could download versions of TikTok outside of Google’s Play Store and install them on their devices. However, sideloading like this can come with security risks if the apps are not verified, and doing the same on an iPhone, via jailbreaking the device, is more technically complex.\nEqually, moves such as changing locations of app stores to be outside of the US may come with unforeseen consequences and prove harder to maintain for general users in the long term. For instance, if you are changing an iCloud account’s location, Apple advises that you may need to cancel subscriptions and have a valid payment method for the location you are changing it to.\nPrateek Waghre, a technology policy researcher based in India, where TikTok has been banned for four years and, despite an influx of some homegrown competitors, largely saw people move to Instagram Reels or YouTube’s Shorts, says overall restrictions on apps and websites weakens people’s experiences online and damages the internet as a whole.\n“For many of us, [it is] the realization of one of our fears of a ‘splinternet,’” Waghre says. “You will have different kinds of access based on different geography, which is not what the experience of the internet was.”",

    "content_text": "This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nOn Tuesday, after a ferocious Santa Ana windstorm blew through Southern California, a severe brush fire broke out in the wealthy Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, burning 1,000 structures and forcing tens of thousands of residents to evacuate as of Wednesday afternoon. Another large brush fire broke out near Pasadena around the same time, killing at least two people. Together the two blazes threatened some of the most valuable homes and businesses in the United States. The damage from the Palisades Fire alone could exceed $10 billion, according to a preliminary estimate from J.P. Morgan.\nIf this estimate holds true, it will test insurers’ commitment to a market that has been teetering on the verge of collapse for the better part of a decade now. Over the past five years, California has become a poster child for what climate-fueled weather disasters can do to a state’s home insurance market. Following a rash of historic wildfires in 2017 and 2018, insurance companies have fled the state, dropped tens of thousands of customers in flammable areas, and raised prices by double-digit percentages.\nUntil recently, elected officials have taken few major steps to address the crisis. But late last month, after more than a year of drafting, California’s insurance commissioner unveiled a set of reforms that he claimed will bring companies back into the fold as they take effect this year.\n“This is a historic moment for California,” said Ricardo Lara, the state’s insurance commissioner, when he revealed the rules in December. “With input from thousands of residents throughout California, this reform balances protecting consumers with the need to strengthen our market against climate risks.”\nThe rules come after months of debate among state insurance officials, lawmakers, insurance companies, and consumer advocates. The biggest change is that California will now require many insurance companies to do more business in what the state calls “distressed areas,” the fire-prone scrubland and mountain regions where insurers are now hiking prices and dropping customers. Companies will soon have to ensure that their market share in these areas is at least 85 percent of their total statewide market share—in other words, if a company controls 10 percent of the state’s insurance market, it must control at least 8.5 percent of the market in fire-prone areas.\nThis mandate should push big companies like State Farm and Allstate to pick up customers they’ve dropped in flammable regions like the mountainous north of the state. Some companies have already begun to offer new policies in burned areas in anticipation of the state’s new rules: the insurance company Mercury announced last week that it will be the first insurance company in the state to offer new policies in Paradise, California, which was destroyed in the catastrophic 2018 Camp Fire. The move recognizes the town’s work to mitigate future fires by clearing trees and hardening homes.\nThe requirement to expand coverage, coupled with recent announcements from companies like Mercury, “should give consumers hope that competition and options will be returning,” said Amy Bach, the head of insurance customer advocacy group United Policyholders, in a statement.\nIn return for this added coverage, the state is making a few big tweaks that will allow insurers to pass on the price of fire risk to their customers. California is the only state in the country that doesn’t allow insurance companies to use forward-looking “catastrophe models” when they set prices. It also prohibits companies from factoring in the rising costs of reinsurance, the insurance purchased by insurance companies to ensure they’re able to pay out big claims.\nThese two restrictions have kept prices artificially low for years, and also prevented insurers from planning for climate change impacts, creating a de facto subsidy for homeowners in risky areas.\n“This addresses the major stumbling blocks that companies have been identifying for a decade, so that’s a positive,” said Rex Frazier, the president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, the state’s leading insurance trade group.\nThis trade-off has some residents in fire-prone areas worried. Insurance companies might now have to offer more policies in flammable zones, but they also have more latitude to increase prices.\n“I’m not optimistic that it will improve the experience of the consumer, as the insurers can now pass certain costs onto consumers, which I’m expecting will result in higher premiums,” said Jason Lloyd, who moved to mountainous Lake County last spring. He and his wife came to the area because they wanted to be closer to his wife’s family, but when they made an offer on a home, they learned that they would have to pay more than $8,000 a year for insurance, or else go to the California FAIR Plan, a state-run insurance program that offers minimal coverage.\nLloyd and his wife later bought another home in Hidden Valley Lake, a town that has taken ambitious steps to reduce flammable vegetation, but their insurance premium is still more than $4,500 a year, more than triple what it was on their last home in Kansas. Lloyd is worried that his insurance company will hike his price further under the new rules.\nOther states across the West such as Colorado and Oregon are also seeing insurance coverage gaps emerge after big wildfires, though their problems are less acute than those in the Golden State. In Colorado, for instance, officials just recently established a state fire insurance backstop like California’s FAIR Plan, since it’s only in the past few years that customers there have been dropped en masse. California’s grand bargain with the insurance industry provides a blueprint for those other states: If you want to address coverage gaps, you need to give insurers broader authority to set prices.\nEven this might not be enough. The past few years have seen a reprieve from major wildfires like the ones that struck in 2017 and 2018, but this week’s blazes in the Los Angeles area could cause billions of dollars of damage, on par with an event like the Camp Fire.\nJoel Laucher, a former regulator and fire insurance expert at the consumer advocacy organization United Policyholders, said that the damage from the Los Angeles blazes could lead to further price hikes and more availability gaps.\n“These are going to be major losses, certainly,” he told Grist. “Certain areas are definitely going to have new challenges, to the degree that insurers are going to be able to charge to the rate they believe those areas deserve to pay.” Laucher said that insurance companies may not decline to renew as many policies as they might have under previous state rules, but they could still avoid selling policies in some of the affected areas.\nFrazier, of the insurance trade group, voiced similar concerns. He said that another round of monster blazes on the scale of 2017 and 2018 could drive the insurance industry away from the state once again, despite the commissioners’ reforms.\n“If we were to have a couple more unprecedented years, all bets are off,” he told Grist.",

Elon Musk, of course. This new government committee led by Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy is being tasked with cutting the federal budget. So this week, we examine the Silicon Valley mindset behind it.\nYou can follow Michael Calore on Bluesky at @snackfight, Lauren Goode on Bluesky at @laurengoode, and Zoë Schiffer on Threads @reporterzoe. Write to us at uncannyvalley@wired.com.\nHow to Listen\nYou can always listen to this week's podcast through the audio player on this page, but if you want to subscribe for free to get every episode, here's how:\nIf you're on an iPhone or iPad, open the app called Podcasts, or just tap this link. You can also download an app like Overcast or Pocket Casts and search for “uncanny valley.” We’re on Spotify too.\nTranscript\nNote: This is an automated transcript, which may contain errors.\nMichael Calore: So how's everybody doing? What have we all been listening to lately?\nZoë Schiffer: I'm excited to talk about the fact that we've all been listening to Joe Rogan, the expansive universe of Joe Rogan.\n[Archival audio]: Joe Rogan Podcast, check it out.\nZoë Schiffer: It's been big on the group chat lately.\nLauren Goode: Well, I took a recommendation from you, Zoë, from one of our earlier episodes, and I listened to the Joe Rogan interview with Peter Attia.\nZoë Schiffer: Love it.\nLauren Goode: But you recommended his book, and I was going for a long walk the other day, and I thought, \"Maybe I'll just listen to a podcast with him.\" And I ended up on the Joe Rogan show.\nZoë Schiffer: It must have been a long walk.\nLauren Goode: I mean, I heard a lot about jujitsu. 56 minutes of that show was taken up on jujitsu, and then it was also like, \"Also, how to live forever.\" I don't know. Yeah.\nMichael Calore: I really want to hear that, because I was fascinated when you started talking about it, and Zoë has been talking about him. I don't want to read his book, but I would listen to him on Joe Rogan. The Big Joe Rogan thing for me was the recent appearance by Marc Andreessen.\nLauren Goode: Ooh, what was that like?\nMichael Calore: It was like 18 hours.\nLauren Goode: Wow. You were deep in the broligarchy.\nZoë Schiffer: I listened to it because you were talking about it, and I was like... And it's relevant for our conversation today, but damn, was it long?\nMichael Calore: It is. And this show will not be 18 hours long, but it is relevant to the topic, because we're going to be talking about DOGE.\nLauren Goode: So once again, the broligarchy.\nMichael Calore: The broligarchy.\nLauren Goode: Let's do it.\nMichael Calore: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: And I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nZoë Schiffer: And I am Zoë Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nMichael Calore: Today, we are demystifying DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, the meme coin. As Lauren calls it, the broligarchy. We'll talk about the key players, what their proposed plan is for the U.S. government, and what we think is really behind it all. DOGE. OK. We are talking about DOGE today, and no, not the meme coin.\nZoë Schiffer: Although the meme coin is relevant here, because that is the big joke. That's why they chose this acronym. So just to give a little background on what that even means, meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency that are based off of a joke. It's like almost making fun of cryptocurrency itself. So Dogecoin is one that Elon Musk has promoted for a long time now. There are others like BONK and FLOKI that I think are named after his dog, Floki, not BONK. They actually are a type of crypto, but they're based off of an internet joke.\nLauren Goode: Wasn't there also a Hawk Tuah coin recently?\nZoë Schiffer: Ew.\nMichael Calore: There was. Yes.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. And how did that go?\nMichael Calore: Not well.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: Meme coins generally do not go well. But this one has a second life, because now it's been rebranded as the Department of Government Efficiency, of which Elon Musk is one of the people in charge.\nZoë Schiffer: Yes.\nLauren Goode: And everyone is talking about this DOGE.\n[Archival audio]: Two wealthy Trump supporters set to take an axe to federal spending.\nZoë Schiffer: DOGE has gone mainstream, finally.\n[Archival audio]: We believe it's an historic moment for the country, and you're going to see a lot of change around here and in Washington and the way things are run.\nMichael Calore: Let's start by talking about what DOGE is.\nLauren Goode: OK. So the first thing to know is that DOGE is not actually an official government organization. It is an initiative that's being led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\nVivek Ramaswamy [Archival audio]: Elon Musk and I are in a position to start the mass deportations of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the D.C. bureaucracy. That, too, is how we're going to save this country.\nLauren Goode: And the idea is that they're going to take this very Silicon Valley mindset to the federal government and look at some of the bloat that exists in the federal government, and figure out where to make cuts or at least where to suggest Donald Trump make cuts when he's back in office. So it's unclear whether or not they're going to have the authority to directly make changes in federal spending, which are typically controlled by Congress, but they are basically arguing that President-elect Donald Trump has the authority to cut spending authorized by Congress, and that they're going to make suggestions for how he does that.\nZoë Schiffer: Right. And I feel like if all goes well, their suggestions will be taken really seriously. Donald Trump is becoming president again. The Republicans control both houses of Congress. So presumably, Vivek and Elon make suggestions to Trump. Trump takes them. Congress enacts them, what have you, and their plans, which sound kind of far-fetched and radical at this point, could become reality.\nMichael Calore: So why these two guys? Why Elon? Why Vivek? What is it about their mindset that appeals to Trump and the Republicans coming into power who want to downsize the government?\nLauren Goode: I'm going to let Zoë talk about Elon, but I think we should do some table setting for Vivek here. He's a really interesting person. He's just 39 years old. This is one of those moments where you're like, \"Oh, he's younger than me.\" Not me. Do you ever have that moment where you go to see a surgeon, and this person's going to cut open your body, and you're like, “Wait, you're younger than me. What?” OK.\nMichael Calore: It's an apt metaphor here.\nLauren Goode: Right. He's Harvard-educated. He went to Yale Law School.\nZoë Schiffer: With JD Vance, we should say. They're friends.\nLauren Goode: He founded a pharmaceutical company back in 2014. I read a little interesting tidbit about him. The biotech company he founded is called Roivant Sciences. That's R-O-I-V-A-N-T. And supposedly, the Roi in the company's name refers to return on investment.\nMichael Calore: Of course.\nLauren Goode: Yes. And Vivek also declared his candidacy for the Republican Party nomination in the United States 2024 presidential elections. He eventually dropped out, threw his support behind Trump, and now I guess he is appointed to this non-government government role where he is going to be in charge of slashing the federal government's budget, alongside Zoë's favorite person in the world.\nZoë Schiffer: Elon Musk.\nLauren Goode: Elon Musk.\nZoë Schiffer: Yes. Good friend of mine, famously connected over Signal. Just kidding. He never responds to my messages. But Mike, to your point-\nLauren Goode: But you do message him?\nZoë Schiffer: Yes. Well, we have to, to ask for comment. It's a humiliating process. You're either getting the poop emoji, or he's responding with the crying-laughing emoji for me. Anyway, Mike, you said what about their mindset is attractive to Trump, but I actually think a question that's relevant before we get to the mindset is what's attractive about their wallets, because Elon Musk threw a ton of money behind Donald Trump's reelection campaign, and ultimately seems like he was successful in that effort, obviously, to get him reelected. Whether or not he had enormous impact, a little difficult to say. But obviously, he put a lot of effort behind it and a lot of money behind it. So I think there's a certain level with Trump's appointments right now where it does look like he's rewarding people who have been loyal to him, and Elon Musk was one of those people. At the same time, Elon bought Twitter in 2022, transformed it to X, and made it kind of a political machine, which he deployed to get Trump reelected. But at the same time, he made a lot of changes to the company and the company culture that people like Trump find pretty attractive. He cut costs in a pretty ruthless way. He fired more than half the company shortly after taking over, and these are lessons that Trump and other people, who are about to be in charge of the federal government, want him to apply to the government itself.\nMichael Calore: OK. So these guys have hired some of their friends. They've hired some government insiders and some government outsiders, and they're sitting in rooms. They're having conversations. They're opening up the books and taking a hard look at the U.S. government. When they look, what do they see? What kinds of things are on the table for them?\nZoë Schiffer: I think it's generous that you think they're opening up the books and doing this examination, because I'm a little worried that that's not what's happening, but let's hope it is. The big thing is that the federal budget right now is about $7 trillion. And they've thrown around different numbers, but basically say, \"I think we could cut around $2 trillion from that budget.\" They really see federal spending as being kind of out of control and putting the United States on a bad path where, in their words, it could be on the path to bankruptcy, and this would obviously put everyone in a very bad position. So the first thing that they want to do is cut costs as quickly as possible, and part of that is head count. So firing a lot of people who currently work in the federal government, and reducing the number of government agencies.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: Aside from just bloated head count that they see is just a government that works way too slow. Elon has said that, with SpaceX in particular, his company can build a rocket faster than the federal government can process the paperwork to allow that rocket to launch. So I think everywhere they look, they're just like, \"These processes are inefficient, and we need to streamline them.\"\nMichael Calore: And we should also note that this is not the first time that we've had one of these commissions, either within the government or next to the government, that have taken a hard look at the budget and decided to make a bunch of cuts. It happened in the 1940s and '50s. It happened during the Reagan administration. It happened when Al Gore was vice president. I remember he headed up one of these. So this is yet another opportunity for the government to take a hard look at itself, or in this case, have two outsiders take a hard look at the government and make difficult choices about what to keep and what to throw away. So if you look at the government and you break down what we actually spend money on, there is interest that we pay down on our massive national debt, and then there is mandatory and discretionary spending, and the mandatory and discretionary spending make up for about 90 percent of the government's spending. The military, Social Security, unemployment, and labor make up a majority of both discretionary and mandatory government spending. And in total, there are almost 3 million people who work for the federal government. So what fits into that 90 percent? When we look at all of the different things that we can make cuts to, what is DOGE looking at?\nLauren Goode: Well, Zoë already mentioned cutting the actual workforce, taking a close look at the people who currently work for the federal government. The New Yorker actually reported that Vivek Ramaswamy once said that he would introduce a thought experiment to how this might be done. He would take the 2 million federal civilian employees and say, \"If your Social Security number ends in an odd number, you're out. If it ends in an even number, you're in. There's a 50 percent cut right there.\"\nZoë Schiffer: Now we see why him and Elon Musk have such a bromance going on, because that feels very Twitter 2022 cuts.\nLauren Goode: Welcome to the Hunger Games. Yeah. Unclear whether or not that's actually going to become a reality, but yeah. So they want to slash spending by cutting workers. Supposedly, they want to target $500 billion in spending that is unauthorized by Congress, as well as programs that they think aren't in line with, quote, unquote, \"lawmakers' intentions.\" The biggest source of expired authorizations is in healthcare for veterans. That accounted for $119 billion in 2024, according to the Congressional Budget Office, but the DOGE bros haven't singled out veterans healthcare as a place where they'd seek to cut. Instead, they're looking at things like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which receives over $500 million a year, international organizations that they say receive over a billion dollars in grants, Planned Parenthood. Basically, they're looking at progressive groups as ways to cut spending, in addition to looking at cutting the actual workforce. They also said that they want to require these federal workers to be in the office five days a week, which they think will result in some voluntary termination. So basically, they're taking the Amazon approach here.\nZoë Schiffer: Wait. Was this on the Marc Andreessen episode of the Joe Rogan podcast, Mike, where they were talking about the fact that... I think Marc Andreessen was saying, \"Oh, a lot of these federal workers have actually moved to the Ozarks and stuff, and they're working remotely, getting this paycheck that's supposed to cover the cost of living in D.C., but they're living somewhere much cheaper. They're never coming into the office, and it's costing us tax dollars. So those people need to go,\" which immediately when you hear that, you're like, \"Is that happening?\"\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: It's really interesting how much animosity they seem to have towards specifically the people who work from home, although I guess if we look at how they run their companies, it makes sense.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. There are definitely shades of Silicon Valley here, which is why we're talking about it on Uncanny Valley. Musk and Ramaswamy wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal in which they talked about their DOGE plans. They said they want to use embedded agents and advanced technology to first determine the bloat within various departments, and then make suggestions for cutting spending that they then send on to Trump and Congress for consideration, and they're really going hard. They're calling themselves crusaders.\nMichael Calore: And relying on algorithmic tools to make a lot of these decisions.\nLauren Goode: I don't know if they've specifically said that they're going to be using AI to do it, but they did just say advanced technology.\nMichael Calore: Sure.\nZoë Schiffer: That feels AI-coded, to say the least. I feel like they have mentioned cutting military spending. Am I wrong on that? Because that one surprised me a little bit. I was like, \"Planned Parenthood, of course.\" Same with NPR and stuff. These are organizations that either Ramaswamy and Musk, or the Republican Party more generally, have had issues with. So I think it's unsurprising to see that they would be kind of a primary target.\nLauren Goode: Now, granted, some of this stuff that they're talking about in terms of procurement processes, expired contracts, or just contracts that haven't been reevaluated in a long time, as well as the government workforce, they're not totally off the mark here. If you talk to anyone in government, they'll say, \"Yeah. It's basically impossible to fire someone in government.\" Civil servants have a lot of protections, and for good reason in many cases, but it also means that you have people there who maybe are no longer suitable for the job.\nZoë Schiffer: Totally. I think the fear is just how are they actually going to evaluate who is good at their job and who's not, because if we look at how they did this process at Twitter, it was super chaotic, and the objective was basically cost savings. And the DOGE commission has two goals here. They're trying to cut costs as quickly as possible, but they're also trying to make a point about how good the incoming Trump administration is going to be and how bad they feel the Biden administration was. And I think the worry is that that secondary goal is going to encourage them to move really, really fast, and that humans will be collateral damage.\nMichael Calore: So there's certainly a lot of turmoil ahead. And we still have a lot to talk about, so let's take a quick break, and we'll come right back. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. We are talking about DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. So one of the things that DOGE is tasked with doing is just reducing overall bloat in government and bloated spending budgets, and I think that all of us can identify a point in our lives in the recent past where we have run into some sort of weird bureaucratic nonsense in the government and said, \"There has to be a way to make this better.\" And I know that this is one of the things that they have talked about, being Silicon Valley guys. They've said that, \"We're going to introduce technology into government systems. We're going to get new computers, because they're more efficient, and they are more secure than these old, outdated systems that the government has right now.\"\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. I mean, I do feel like maybe it's because we've all been listening to too much Joe Rogan, but I think some of what they're saying makes a lot of sense, generally. A lot of these systems are inefficient, Mike, to your point. A lot of the technology is outdated. Something is broken in this system right now. And having someone come in who's willing to say, \"This doesn't make sense, and we could do it different,\" there's value to that. It's just that a lot could be lost along the way, and it's not clear that they're going to go about it in the way that they're saying.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. And I think we've seen some hints that technologies like AI are going to be used as part of this government efficiency playbook. Trump has tapped David Sacks, the venture capitalist, to take on a free-floating role in his administration, overseeing AI and crypto. And I'm sure that if Elon and Vivek have David Sacks and his team at their disposal, they will probably use it.\nZoë Schiffer: We're going to see Grok making the decisions over who gets to keep their job.\nLauren Goode: That's the thing that's unclear to me, is whether or not they're bringing in these guys because they want them to actually advise on how technology is used as part of government services, or because they're going to be hugely influential over the types of regulations that are rolled back or introduced.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: I think it's more the latter. I can't imagine David Sacks rolling up his sleeves and being like, \"Let me program generative AI bot to make sure that you can file your taxes better. Also, here's where you file your crypto, or don't, because it's crypto.\"\nMichael Calore: Right. So we have David Sacks, and who else is involved in this besides our DOGE bros?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. So some of the other names that are involved in this: Marc Andreessen, who heads up a16z or Andreessen Horowitz; Bill Ackman, who's a hedge fund manager. And they've gotten some support from Democrats, right?\nMichael Calore: They have. Yes. Elon Musk has taken to X to post a lot of his opinions about what types of things should be cut and what types of programs don't make sense, and he's gotten some support from people who might be kind of surprising, like Ro Khanna, who is a representative who represents Silicon Valley and parts of Northern California; Bernie Sanders-\nLauren Goode: Bernie Sanders. Yeah.\nMichael Calore: ...from Vermont, have both said, \"Some of these ideas are actually good,\" because nobody likes waste. Everybody likes to be able to say, \"Oh, that is actually a smart thing to cut.\"\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. And even with the hiring-firing thing, I have friends who work in government who say that the process of getting hired or letting someone go is totally nuts these days. It's like, to actually evaluate who should get an interview for a government job, oftentimes they're taking people's résumés and their keyword matching the résumés against the job description, and whoever has the closest match gets an interview. These are processes that do need to change.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. And that's part of the reason that DOGE exists and is built the way that it is, because it's not a government organization. It sits next to the government and advises it, and these guys have come in and said, \"We are not politicians. We're not big government people. We're entrepreneurs. We know how to cut costs. We know how to move quickly, and that's the energy that we're going to bring to the party.\"\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. It's funny because I feel like they've been getting some criticism for, like, \"Look at these guys who have no experience in politics, who are jumping in, thinking they can do things better.\" But when you hear them talk, they actually see that as a huge asset. They say things like, \"Career politicians got to go. That's not a good thing.\" And in fact, in the past, in U.S. history, it was normal for someone in business who had had a lot of success to come do a tour in government for a short time and apply the lessons they learned in industry to the government. So they see that as a total positive.\nLauren Goode: And so far, based on what they're proposing, I still think that some of the negatives potentially outweigh the positives.\nMichael Calore: Absolutely.\nLauren Goode: But we're acknowledging the positives on this podcast.\nMichael Calore: We are.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: We're acknowledging that there's a need to cut through some of the bloat that exists in the federal government. We're acknowledging that this is even creating a general awareness, I think, for a lot of people of how the government works and how government spending works.\nMichael Calore: Totally.\nLauren Goode: People are suddenly interested in DOGE, \"What is DOGE? What are these guys doing? How are they going to do it?\" It's Elon, that amount of attention being brought to this. I'm sure there are tons of people right now who are reading about the federal budget that didn't even realize how much was being spent and what was being spent on mandatory versus discretionary spending. I also think some of these big, boldface names could be good for recruitment. People here that Marc Andreessen or David Sacks, or whoever it might be, has some hand in reshaping our government, and all of a sudden, they might be interested in not just making a ton of money in the private sector, but actually doing something for a couple of years that lends itself to bettering the government. OK. I think the bad here is that, one, bringing that Silicon Valley mindset to the government means you're bringing, in some instances, an incredible hubris. And this is not like running a startup. This is the government, which also means you could potentially roll back regulations and social services that truly do exist to serve the American people, because this is not the Elon and Vivek Show. We vote for government officials because they work for us. So these guys have to remember that what they're doing is ultimately to create a government that works for us, the American people.\nMichael Calore: To the point you were making earlier, Lauren, when you have these extremely wealthy and powerful businessmen from Silicon Valley hiring other people like them to sit down and make decisions about what should stay and what should go, it is hard to see a future in which they cut things that serve their interests and keep things that work against their interests.\nLauren Goode: Right. And I've been talking to some folks who work in government, and one of the things that they said they really want to see is more energetic, smart, tech-savvy people actually getting into government and rolling up their sleeves and doing the work to make the government operate more efficiently. They don't want to see lists and reports and all these things generated telling people what needs to be fixed, because the government's been doing that for decades, and it hasn't been fixed. They need actually people to come in and do the groundwork. And so, maybe that is one of the upsides of having these boldface names there.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. And my response to them would be, I doubt you'll see a single report, but you may see many, many lists, because if we knew or if we learned anything from the Twitter takeover, it's that things were done very, very quickly. A lot of lists were generated, and there was very little paperwork involved.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: So it depends on what your Social Security number ended in, odd number or even number, at Twitter?\nZoë Schiffer: I mean, one other thing that... The way that they're talking about cutting spending has this kind of zero-budgeting mindset, which they applied at Twitter, which was basically, \"Let's start from a budget of zero and justify every expense on top of that.\" And they've said, \"Hey, if we do get rid of an agency that was doing important work, we'll just reinstate it after the fact,\" which sounds good in theory, but what happens in the interim if that agency was providing critical services for people?\nMichael Calore: Total chaos. Also, we have a pretty clear idea about what is in their crosshairs, because these are rich guys from Silicon Valley who run businesses, and they're probably going to go after the government agencies that regulate their businesses. They've talked about undoing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is an agency that was born after the financial crisis of 2008, and it regulates banks, and it regulates the credit card industry, and Silicon Valley has, for a long time, been very hostile towards this agency. So that's probably gone.\nLauren Goode: Right.\nZoë Schiffer: I think that's my fear, which is, a lot of this sounds good in theory, but then when they start to talk about specifics, it seems like, \"Hey, I don't know if they're going after agencies that are wasting taxpayer money. It seems like they're going after agencies that have a different ideological viewpoint in their mind than they do,\" which it seems a little bit like going after their enemies versus going after, I guess, our enemies.\nMichael Calore: Yes. And probably, the thing that a lot of people are scared about is that the sort of public safety nets that the administrative state upholds, like Medicare, like Social Security, will fall under the same scrutiny and will be downsized, and that kind of goes against the platform that Trump ran and won on, which is that, \"I'm here for you, the little guy. I'm here for the working class.\"\nLauren Goode: Right. The working class, the middle class, the populist vote, essentially.\nMichael Calore: Yes. And going after those agencies that basically support the working class and support the people who do not have the wealth advantage in this country runs counter to the policies that the administration won on.\nLauren Goode: Right.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. And it feels like the way that they talk about it, it kind of has the trickle-down economics flavor, where it's like, \"Hey, if the government isn't taxing you as much, if the government is not spending as much money, then there will be more money circulating in the private sector, and people will be able to spend that money how they want.\" But that's kind of been a divide that's existed for a long time between how liberals and conservatives view the economy.\nMichael Calore: Right. So we don't know what's going to happen with DOGE. There could be no policies that come out of it. Every agency could be the same, just with half the people, because they did the Social Security number trick. I also just want to float the theory that I've heard from several people, which is that DOGE really is just, Trump needed to give these two guys something to do. He just needed them to go sit in a room somewhere so that they would be out of his hair.\nZoë Schiffer: Ooh, I don't think that that's true. I feel like he really does respect their intellect and is excited to see what they can do here.\nMichael Calore: OK. At what point do they start butting heads, and then it all falls apart?\nZoë Schiffer: OK. Well, that's fair. That's fair because Trump is incredibly sensitive to looking like he's a puppet and someone else is pulling the strings. This is famously how he's fallen out with various family members of his who were part of the federal government previously. So yes, totally possible that him and Elon Musk, two men with famously big egos, will, at some point, have a disagreement. But right now, they're really useful to each other. So maybe they'll be friends.\nLauren Goode: Well, there's also an end date to this project too. Elon and Vivek have said that this project is running until July 4th, 2026, so America's birthday. At that point, they'll have sort of concluded the DOGE project, and they hope to have made, I guess, all of their cuts, people's jobs at that point, and really, what does the workforce look like after that? So the fact that it has an end date makes me think, \"Huh. OK. This could actually be a thing that goes on for the next 18 months,\" that we're going to be, of course, monitoring closely. On the other hand, I just think of Elon as being someone who... He's actually an incredibly busy person too. He's running a lot of companies in the private sector, one of which is a federal government contractor. But yes, he's got a lot going on, and his attention seems to be going in a bunch of different directions at the same time. So can he continue to give DOGE the amount of attention that's actually going to be required to make these kind of changes without completely fucking up the government?\nMichael Calore: I think this is a big win for him. This position is probably more important than those CEO jobs that he has, because he has the power now to influence policy in the U.S. government that benefits those companies.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: I actually think there's a lot of synchronicity between all of his different jobs at this point. The agencies that he proposes cutting are regulating some of his companies. So there's benefits there. He's going to be spreading the gospel of DOGE on X, and X will be getting more attention because of this. So it's like, I totally agree, Lauren. He is a busy man. He's doing a bunch of different things at the same time. It feels like a lot of these projects are helping one another, and DOGE is kind of the linchpin of all of it in this moment in time.\nLauren Goode: Zoë, you also had a theory that you think X is really going to become the messaging platform for DOGE. Also, someone, I think, on the All-In Podcast, they said that Vivek is going to be doing a Dogecast. I don't know if that's true.\nZoë Schiffer: Oh, yeah.\nMichael Calore: Can't wait.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. And they were also asking for cohost recommendations, because I think David Sacks might be a little busy this next year as the AI and crypto czar.\nLauren Goode: Are you going to throw your hat in the ring, Zoë?\nZoë Schiffer: Yes. Pick me, guys. I'll be part of the jokes as you're joking about masturbating to The Wall Street Journal op-ed. I'll just be right in there, throwing it down with the boys.\nMichael Calore: Listeners to the All-In Podcast understood that reference.\nLauren Goode: That's extreme pick-me energy, Zoë. Yeah, exactly.\nZoë Schiffer: No, but I think they already have. There's a DOGE handle that's been spreading information relevant to DOGE about, like, \"Look at the Social Security Administration. They've allowed all of their workers to work from home forever.\" And it's like, I think, supposed to get people kind of riled up about all of the bloat and all of the waste.\nMichael Calore: Well, it is just the very beginning of this very long year. So we do not know what is going to happen with DOGE and what cuts they're going to make, but I'm sure this is not the last time we're going to talk about it. And actually, before we leave today, we're going to take another break, and then we're going to come back and pretend that we have been appointed to DOGE, and we're going to make our recommendations on what should get cut from the federal government. All right. Lauren and Zoë, the podcast is over, and now you are an intern for DOGE. You're making your 28.50 an hour, and you have been asked to submit a list of suggestions for things that they should cut. So who wants to go first?\nLauren Goode: Oh, brutal. It has to be something that they would cut? Can it be something that's additive?\nMichael Calore: I think this is your chance to inject some of your own ideology into government efficiency, however you define those things.\nZoë Schiffer: Interpret it how you will.\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: I am not going to suggest that they cut the IRS, but I'm going to suggest that they make it a better tax process for everybody.\nMichael Calore: You have a problem with our tax code? Is that what you're saying?\nLauren Goode: Simplifying the process. Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: And you're saying I had pick-me energy? You went straight into taxes.\nLauren Goode: I just think in terms of how we process our taxes, I think that they should be looking at Estonia. God, not things you're going to hear very often on this podcast.\nZoë Schiffer: Didn't think you were going to go there.\nMichael Calore: Tell us about Estonia.\nLauren Goode: I look to Estonia. Estonia is generally known as having really, really good government services. It's a much smaller country than the United States, so it's not entirely applicable. But supposedly, 99 percent of their government services are online, including procedures for setting up a business and filing all their taxes. Supposedly, the process of filing your taxes can take as little as three minutes. So that's according to The Economist.\nZoë Schiffer: Whoa.\nLauren Goode: Yes. And so, I can envision this world where we are not only able to file taxes really easily, say from our phones, but we should be able to do it on an ongoing basis. So if you are a contractor or a freelancer, or you have an income stream coming from somewhere other than your standard W-2, you should just be able to use your smartphone to file that income immediately, get an estimate for what it is going to be that you owe. Right now, we can do this using accountants and other cumbersome online services. It should all just be easy. It should all be like, \"Here's what you're going to owe. Here's exactly when.\" And then when it comes time to file, you literally push a button that says \"File.\" They have all of the information on our income already living somewhere. Why can we not do this?\nZoë Schiffer: You mean we shouldn't have a purposefully opaque tax system that makes it really confusing for regular people?\nLauren Goode: Right. We should have private sector software that's been erroneously charging consumers for years now, until someone finally came in and said, \"By the way, you're supposed to be able to do this for free.\" But the free system sucks. So yeah, just make it better.\nMichael Calore: I like that.\nLauren Goode: I'm getting passionate. Can you tell?\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: I'm fired up about this.\nMichael Calore: And to all of the CPAs out there, on behalf of WIRED, I'm sorry.\nLauren Goode: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nMichael Calore: If your Social Security number ends between zero and nine, and you are a CPA-\nLauren Goode: You know what? I'm going to do this Silicon Valley thing here. This is just going to allow you to level up in your career.\nZoë Schiffer: Oh, yeah.\nLauren Goode: You no longer have to push buttons, and-\nZoë Schiffer: You'll have all that time for creative pursuits.\nMichael Calore: Zoë, what would you cut?\nZoë Schiffer: OK. Well, this is a more state-specific one, but as a lifelong Californian, I want to make it easier to build. I feel like we desperately need more housing. And in Southern California, where I live, it is completely ridiculous how difficult it is to get permits to build more housing, to build more ADUs, and it's really hurting our housing economy. So that would be kind of my one. Mike, you love this?\nMichael Calore: But what about the snowy plovers?\nZoë Schiffer: I know. I know. I get it. The NIMBYism is strong, particularly in the Bay Area, but it just has to happen.\nLauren Goode: And Zoë's not saying that you should be building on the snowy plover habitats on the beach. She's saying, \"Allow for ADUs or giant parking lots that we don't need.\" Of course, people are going to get mad at me for saying that. People love their parking lots.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. It shouldn't be this multi-month-long process to get a permit to start building. We desperately need more housing in this state. And so, let's get on it.\nMichael Calore: I think we're all in agreement on that.\nLauren Goode: But then, wait, who's going to lose their job now, Zoë, because you're proposing this?\nZoë Schiffer: Oh.\nLauren Goode: If I destroy the accountants?\nZoë Schiffer: Well, all of the people processing the permits who are doubtlessly working from home from the Ozarks and not actually residing in California, those people have to go.\nLauren Goode: You're hired. You're hired into DOGE.\nZoë Schiffer: OK. Mike, what's your service?\nMichael Calore: I have two. I have two small ones. First, cut all of the large, bloated defense contracts. We don't need more bombs and laser missile guidance systems and stealth fighters in the world. We have plenty. We have so many, and we're not really using them. We're just kind of cruising around up there and keeping America safe. But we feel pretty safe, right?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. I feel good.\nMichael Calore: OK. Great. OK. Done. Get rid of it. The other one is that I would love for us to end the billion dollars in subsidies that we give to the fossil fuel industry every year.\nZoë Schiffer: Ooh, Mike does homework.\nMichael Calore: I think the fossil fuel industry needs to maybe feel a little bit of pain as far as the way that things need to go, and then make those big changes that they've been putting off, because they've been getting subsidies from the government, and I know that is a drastic oversimplification of how subsidies work and what the money is used for. But when you see how much money our government pours into keeping fossil fuel industries in business, it is kind of aggravating when we all, as smart, freethinking people in the world who read science publications and work at science publications, know that that is bad and is not what the future should look like. So yeah, cut the subsidies to fossil fuel.\nLauren Goode: You might want to make that suggestion to someone who's not necessarily in a government position, but a government-adjacent position, who also has an EV company.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Who really likes electric cars?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, really into using battery technology.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Who? Who?\nLauren Goode: I don't know.\nMichael Calore: Who?\nLauren Goode: I'll get back to you.\nMichael Calore: Oh, boy.\nLauren Goode: You're hired.\nMichael Calore: Thank you. Well, that is our show for today. We're done. We're just going to go work for DOGE from now on. Just kidding.

I'm going to do this Silicon Valley thing here.

Well, this is a more state-specific one, but as a lifelong Californian, I want to make it easier to build. I feel like we desperately need more housing. And in Southern California, where I live, it is completely ridiculous how difficult it is to get permits to build more housing, to build more ADUs, and it's really hurting our housing economy. So that would be kind of my one. Mike, you love this?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Michael Calore:</strong> But what about the snowy plovers?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> I know. I know. I get it. The NIMBYism is strong, particularly in the Bay Area, but it just has to happen.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> And Zoë's not saying that you should be building on the snowy plover habitats on the beach. She's saying, \"Allow for ADUs or giant parking lots that we don't need.\" Of course, people are going to get mad at me for saying that. People love their parking lots.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> Yeah. It shouldn't be this multi-month-long process to get a permit to start building. We desperately need more housing in this state. And so, let's get on it.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Michael Calore:</strong> I think we're all in agreement on that.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> But then, wait, who's going to lose their job now, Zoë, because you're proposing this?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> Oh.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> If I destroy the accountants?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> Well, all of the people processing the permits who are doubtlessly working from home from the Ozarks and not actually residing in California, those people have to go.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Lauren Goode:</strong> You're hired. You're hired into DOGE.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> OK. Mike, what's your service?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Michael Calore:</strong> I have two. I have two small ones. First, cut all of the large, bloated defense contracts. We don't need more bombs and laser missile guidance systems and stealth fighters in the world. We have plenty. We have so many, and we're not really using them. We're just kind of cruising around up there and keeping America safe. But we feel pretty safe, right?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Zoë Schiffer:</strong> Yeah. I feel good.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Michael Calore:</strong> OK. Great. OK. Done. Get rid of it. The other one is that I would love for us to end the billion dollars in subsidies that we give to the fossil fuel industry every year.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "During the US elections, centibillionaire and X owner Elon Musk became a central figure in right-wing and Republican politics, helping to propel former president Donald Trump back into the White House. But now it seems like he’s just getting started. In the months since Trump’s victory, Musk has begun to wade into politics in Europe, starting firestorms in the UK and announcing that he’ll be hosting an X Spaces discussion with Alice Weidel, the head of the German right-wing party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), ahead of Germany’s elections in February.\n“We should understand Musk as a sort of international far-right leader,” says João Vieira Magalhaes, assistant professor of media, politics, and democracy at the University of Groningen. “He is an articulator of a truly international far-right movement, which of course, already exists, but in a way that's way more fragmented.”\nThrough X, and his own larger-than-life celebrity presence, Musk is bringing together and boosting the far right across the globe.\nDuring the US elections, Musk emerged as one of Trump’s most important allies. Not only did he help support and fund Trump’s campaign via the America PAC and appear on the campaign trail with the former president, he also used his ownership of X to elevate the campaign’s talking points. After gutting Twitter’s trust and safety teams and allowing previously banned figures back on the platform, research indicated that engagement on X with posts from Musk and other conservative voices were boosted after after Musk publicly endorsed Trump to favor conservative voices and deprioritize critics—what Magalhaes calls “illiberal content moderation.” “He is signaling to whoever wants to listen that this is the space for this kind of political actor,” he says.\nIn December, the German government accused Musk of trying to meddle in the country’s elections after he authored an op-ed in which he endorsed the AfD. The AfD rose to power in the wake of the 2015 refugee crisis, which saw millions of people, particularly from Syria and other parts of the Middle East, flee to Europe, and has a staunchly anti-immigrant stance. Last year, it was revealed that members of the AfD had met with German and Austrian leaders associated with the far right and neo-Nazis to discuss plans for mass deportation if AfD gains more political power, and members of the party have been monitored by the country’s intelligence agencies. The AfD has also been particularly adept at using social media to garner support, including running anti-immigrant ads on Meta’s platforms that appeared to violate the company’s policies at the time.\nIn response to Musk’s op-ed, Weidel posted a video in which she thanked Musk “so much for your note,” and wished Trump and Musk “all the best for the upcoming tenure.”\nGermany isn’t the only country Musk is weighing in on on behalf of the far right. Since the close of the US election, Musk has taken aim at politics in the UK, attacking British prime minister Keir Starmer, a member of the left-of-center Labor Party, and even calling for his imprisonment. Starmer’s government “is one of the very few governments in rich countries or especially important countries that is leaning left,” says Magalhaes. “And [Musk] has been especially resolute in how he attacks the administration.”\nMost recently, Musk spread conspiracy theories about Muslim “grooming gangs” in the UK, and called for Tommy Robinson, a far-right activist, to be released from prison. Musk’s support for Robinson, who has a history of posting racist and Islamophobic content, initially saw Reform UK leader Nigel Farage push back against the X owner. But in a TV show he hosts on the right-wing GB News station this week, Farage appeared to bend the knee to Musk.\n“I don’t think [Robinson’s] wrong in everything he says,” Farage told his viewers. “I do question why he’s in prison, and being kept in solitary confinement.” (Robinson is in prison after being found in contempt of court for repeating lies about a Syrian refugee.)\nLast year, Musk spent months antagonizing Brazilian supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes after the court issued orders for X to remove a handful of accounts and content that, it said, had violated the law by undermining faith in the integrity of the country’s elections. After Brazil’s right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro lost his reelection bid in 2022, his supporters stormed the country’s legislature on January 8, 2023, claiming that the election had been stolen (it hadn’t), in an echo of the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. Moraes was a staunch opponent of Bolsonaro. X spent months refusing to obey the order, even turning over sealed court orders to the US Congress’ Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, led by right-wing congressman Jim Jordan, which then released them publicly.\nAt the time, many in Brazil felt that Musk’s actions, as well as the release of the orders, were a move to undermine the country’s democracy and sovereignty. The Brazilian court eventually issued an order to block X in the country for noncompliance and issued a fine against Musk-owned Starlink, after which X complied with the orders.\nHe also fiercely attacked Nicolas Maduro, president of Venezuela, during the country’s elections (which many in the international community believe to have been rigged).\n“He has established himself as a powerful connection hub between different groups of people across many countries,” says Christian Katzenbach, professor of media and communication at the University of Bremen. Those groups include people in the tech industry, moderate conservatives, advocates of economic liberalism, and right-wing movements. “These groups did not have many connections in the past, but increasingly align on opposing modern mid/left governments.” By amplifying a variety of voices, he says, Musk is actively bringing right-wing perspectives into mainstream debates and opening up new population groups as voters for right-wing parties.\nEven outside of elections, Musk appears to be building alliances with like-minded leaders. In April, Musk met with Argentina’s right-wing president Javier Milei. Milei’s government has slashed spending in ways that Musk said in an X post “will be a helpful model for the rest of the world.” Argentina’s poverty rate under Milei’s government has risen to over 50 percent.\nAnd while Musk certainly seems to be motivated by particular political ideologies, Katzenbach notes that Musk’s involvement in European politics could benefit his business interests, particularly by rolling back social media regulations in the bloc or opening new avenues for his companies. The EU is currently probing X for breaching the Digital Services Act (DSA), which could result in fines. In Italy, Musk is exploring a deal with the right-wing government led by Giorgia Meloni for a deal to launch satellite communications through Starlink to the tune of $1.5 billion, which would compete with a European satellite initiative.\n“Internationally his motives are surely a mixed bag,” says Katzenbach. But either way, Musk seems determined to be a political force beyond any national border.\nDavid Gilbert contributed reporting.",

    "content_text": "As wildfires raged out of control across the Los Angeles area on Wednesday, consuming over 28,000 acres of land, destroying thousands of homes and buildings, including entire neighborhoods, and causing the deaths of at least five people, president-elect Donald Trump, his MAGA acolytes, right-wing commentators, conservative news outlets, and far-right conspiracists all laid the blame not on climate change or on eight months without rain, but on wokeism.\nTrump—who supports vastly expanding the extraction and use of fossil fuels, which scientific consensus directly connects to the increasing prevalence of extreme weather events—used the unfolding tragedy to attack his long-time nemesis, California governor Gavin Newsom. He claimed that the Democrat’s embrace of environmental issues was to blame for the inability of the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) to contain what is already the worst fire in California’s history.\n“Governor Gavin Newscum refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of California, including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “He wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt, by giving it less water (it didn’t work!), but didn’t care about the people of California.”\nThe governor’s press office issued a statement Wednesday slamming Trump’s comment and pointing out that “there is no such document as the water restoration declaration—that is pure fiction.”\nDemocrats’ embrace of so-called woke policies has become an all-purpose bogeyman for the right in recent years. As in previous generations they blamed political correctness and affirmative action for various problems, after major events like the assassination attempt against Trump last July and the Baltimore Bridge collapse last March, they now routinely blame wokeism and diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI).\n“Can we rename DEI to DIE since that’s what seems to happen to the people downstream of those who place woke virtue signaling far above competency?!?,” Donald Trump Jr wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday.\nTrump confidant and centibillionaire X owner Elon Musk, never one to shy away from a conspiracy theory, was also using his platform to boost disinformation about what was to blame for the wildfires.\n“DEI means people DIE,” Musk wrote in one post, while multiple other posts featured criticism of Kristin Crowley, the LAFD chief, a 22-year veteran of the department who was commended for saving nine homes from total destruction during the Woolsey Fire in 2018 alongside her wife.\nCrowley is the first woman and first member of the LGBTQ community to hold the position of fire chief in LA.\nMusk shared a post from Chaya Raichik, the woman behind the hate-filled, anti-LGBTQ account LibsOfTikTok: “Meet Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley. She boasts about being the first female and LGBTQ fire chief in the LA Fire Department. Promoting a culture of DEI is her priority. Does this make you feel safer?” The post has been viewed over 5 million times.\nMusk was also willing to embrace even darker theories about the devastation. When uber-conspiracist Alex Jones posted claims that the fires were part of “a globalist plot to wage economic warfare,” orchestrated as part of a scheme to deindustrialize the US, Musk, in a now deleted post, wrote, “True.”\n(“Globalist,” as Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt has explained, originated as an antisemitic euphemism.)\nAmong the loudest voices targeting Crowley was Oscar-nominated actor turned MAGA firebrand James Woods, who posted a screenshot of the fire chief’s bio on X showing her promise to increase diversity in the department’s ranks.\n“Refilling the water reservoirs would have been a welcome priority, too, but I guess she had too much on her plate promoting diversity,” Woods wrote, referencing news that some fire hydrants had run dry this week. According to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, this can be attributed to the unprecedented strain on its systems caused by the efforts to fight the blaze, as well as damage caused by the fire itself.\nWoods, whose own home was destroyed in the fires, continued his attacks on Crowley during an interview on Fox News, saying that Crowley “took over and she put on her bio that her priority, 'my highest priority,' is inclusion, diversity and equity … and somebody forgot to fill all the reservoirs, I guess, with water.”\nOther right-wing media figures also attacked Crowley, with former Fox News host Megyn Kelly telling her YouTube viewers that “in recent years LA’s fire chief has made not filling the fire hydrants top priority, but diversity.”\nMatt Walsh, a podcaster on the conservative website the Daily Wire, wrote on X: “DEI is a cancer that destroys everything it touches.”",

    "content_text": "This is proving to be a monumental week on the tech and politics beat. On Tuesday, Meta announced that it would be ending its third-party fact-checking program and cutting down its rules barring hate speech in a move clearly targeted at appeasing one person—incoming president Donald Trump.\nThe Supreme Court will also take up TikTok’s lawsuit against the US government and its attempts to ban the app nationwide. We are now less than two weeks out from the deadline for a sale or an extension, so the court doesn’t have a lot of time to save the app—if that’s even what it ends up doing.\nThis week’s events will radically alter the future of the internet in the US, and probably not for the better.\nLet’s talk about it.\nReel-ing Into a Second Trump Administration\nThere’s a reason why mean-spirited TikTok users write “post this on IG Reels” in comment sections on the platform.\nOften, I’ll come across it as a comment on a video of a teenager on TikTok doing something that could easily be considered embarrassing, like singing out of key or obsessing over something others find cringe. Even more upsettingly, you’ll find that comment, word for word, on videos from people with disabilities simply existing. These commenters say this because they believe it’s easier to be nasty to people on Instagram and other Meta platforms. The subtext is that if these users posted to Reels instead of TikTok, they’d receive the harassment the commenters believe they deserve.\nAnd yet, it’s TikTok staring down the barrel of a nationwide ban this week. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, on the other hand, has decided to make his platforms more dangerous to appease the incoming president.\nAs you’ve likely already heard, Meta announced on Tuesday that it would be ending its third-party fact-checking program, replacing it with X-style Community Notes, and “restoring free expression” to its platforms. To accomplish the latter part, the company will relocate its trust and safety operation from California to Texas, purportedly to avoid liberal bias (but not conservative bias, I guess?) and focus its moderation filters on illegal content like terrorism and child sexual abuse material rather than what it calls “lower-severity violations.”\nAll of this comes with an update to Meta’s Community Guidelines, including its Hateful Conduct policy, that essentially allows users to make blatantly homophobic, transphobic, sexist, and racist posts without consequences, as my colleague Kate Knibbs reported this week. For Platformer, Casey Newton noted that, lost amongst other changes, Meta removed a sentence from its guidelines “explaining that hateful speech can ‘promote offline violence.’” Doing so immediately following the anniversary of January 6 is truly something to behold!\nWhy destroy protections for Meta’s most vulnerable users? In a video statement on Tuesday, Zuckerberg explained that the policies were “out of touch with mainstream discourse” and that “recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech.” (Zuckerberg, no one’s idea of a political theorist, didn’t really explain why fact-checking, itself the sort of speech that free-speech activists have long held is the appropriate reaction to bad speech, isn’t worth prioritizing, nor did he explain what he has against the many forms of speech that Meta will still suppress. Free expression, it seems, is identical with whatever Meta happens not to be banning at a given moment.)\nBoth Meta’s and TikTok’s moderation systems are far from perfect and consistently make mistakes. Earlier this week, Taylor Lorenz reported that Meta restricted queer content and hashtags as “sensitive content,” including hashtags like #trans, #lesbianpride, and #bisexualpride. As recently as October, TikTok laid off hundreds of content moderation workers, replacing them with AI.\nBut it’s Instagram, and especially its Reels product, that has a reputation for harassment. With Zuckerberg’s decision to rescind policies barring hateful speech, he’s made clear that distinction is worth the possibility of political clout come Inauguration Day.\nThere’s the possibility that other platforms could follow suit. Elon Musk was the first to set the precedent of rolling trust and safety when he bought X two years ago. After Meta’s announcement on Tuesday, YouTube declined to comment when asked by The Wall Street Journal if it would make similar fact-checking and policy changes, which certainly seems to leave the door open.\nIt appears, though, that TikTok’s parent company is still interested in fact-checking and moderation. Speaking with CNN, one Meta fact-checker said that it will remain operational with funding coming from, among others, Bytedance.\nFor US users, this only really matters as long as TikTok exists within the US. Tomorrow, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case dealing with the government’s attempts to ban the popular app nationwide. If SCOTUS doesn’t save TikTok by January 19, or some magical deal with an American owner isn’t consummated out of the ether, the app—which many users, who have speech rights of their own, see as a safer space than its alternative—will be gone.\nThe Chatroom\nX has seen at least two mass exoduses since Elon Musk took over the platform in 2022. The first occurred soon after Musk closed the deal, and the second came not long after the most recent US election was called for Trump.\nIn light of this week’s news, are you planning to abandon Meta platforms? Do you no longer feel safe on Facebook or Instagram? I’d love to hear about how your social media habits are changing.\nShare your thoughts in the comments below, or send them to mail@wired.com.\nWIRED Reads\n- Meta Follows Elon Musk’s Lead, Moves Staffers to Billionaire-Friendly Texas: In his Tuesday video statement, Zuckerberg said that Meta will move whatever’s left of its trust and safety teams to Texas. The decision is meant to make them appear less politically biased, but really just makes the company look more MAGA.\n- Meta Now Lets Users Say Gay and Trans People Have ‘Mental Illness’: When Meta upended its fact-checking program, it also rewrote some of its policies on what users are allowed to say on the platform. Now, users can accuse gay and trans people of being mentally ill due to their identities.\n- Meta’s Fact-Checking Partners Say They Were ‘Blindsided’ by Decision to Axe Them: Many of Meta’s fact-checking partners rely on the company’s funding to stay afloat. This week, they had the rug pulled out from under them when Meta announced its fact-checking changes without giving them a heads-up.\nWant more?

A lot of the products announced at the show won't be available until later this year, but there are still plenty that are available to buy now. (My apologies to those who promised themselves they wouldn't spend money this soon after the holidays.)

The company also released the OnePlus 13R, which is a more affordable (and a bit less specced) model, but it goes on sale January 14 (you can preorder it now). Neither of the two phones comes with revolutionary improvements, but OnePlus did, of course, incorporate AI features—including an AI Editor in the Photos app, along with a suite of tools that can both summarize and read pages aloud. You'll also get four Android OS upgrades and six years of security updates. Unfortunately, there's no Qi2 support, and wireless charging is available only on the OnePlus 13. We'll have a review for both devices later this week.\nWe're big fans of iFixit's Pro Tech tool kit, which comes complete with a 64-bit driver kit along with openers, tweezers, and prying tools. But it's a bit bulky and can take up a lot of space in your bag. To solve this problem, the company released the Pro Tech Go toolkit. After doing some customer research, the company included only the most used tools, so it's more portable. You'll get a 32-bit driver kit with two tweezers, two spudgers, and some opening tools. It's more affordable too. iFixit also updated its FixHub Power Series Portable Soldering Station ($250), its first soldering iron with USB-C, a web interface to control it, and a fully repairable design. It's available for preorder and will ship in April.\nAsus announced the ROG Phone 9 series in November, and it's now available for purchase. Both the ROG Phone 9 and Phone 9 Pro have a 6.78-inch, 2K AMOLED screen (with 165-Hz LTPO), a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a 50-megapixel rear camera, and support for wireless charging. The Pro, however, also comes with 24 GB of RAM (instead of 16 GB) and 1 TB of storage, plus the AeroActive Cooler X Pro in the box (which is a fan that attaches to the back of the phone to cool the CPU). You can read more details about both phones here. The ROG Phone 9 is also on sale for $900 ($100 off).\nWhether you binge-watched Yellowstone over the holiday break or you've been inspired by Bella Hadid’s equestrian era, the new Western Noir Collection from Otterbox is perfect for those who want to embrace their inner Horse Girl. You'll have the choice of four styles, including Buckaroo, Bronco, Holstein, and Midnight Ride for iPhone 13 through iPhone 16.\nIf you own an iPhone, an Apple Watch, and AirPods, we highly suggest investing in a 3-in-1 wireless charger. This one from Nimble has an adjustable hinge that allows you to charge your gadgets upright or in Standby mode, along with a module for your Apple Watch. When it's not in use, it folds into a compact rectangular brick that you can throw in your bag. It also comes with a 1.5-mm USB-C to USB-C cable and packs support for the Qi2 wireless charging standard.\nOpen earbuds are only growing in popularity, so it was inevitable that we'd see new options come out at CES. Enter: Soundcore's AeroClip earbuds. The latest model is not only fancier and more flexible than earlier models (such as the C30i), but they're also more expensive. The AeroClips have a bowed design, a compact case, and a fit that's light and comfortable thanks to a thin titanium wire covered in a matte coating. It delivers clear audio, and the touch controls are fairly responsive from what we've experienced. They're available for preorder and are expected to ship March 13.\nWe weren't huge fans of the previous Shokz OpenFit (5/10, WIRED Review): The fit wasn't secure, and the buttons were unreliable. The second-generation version appears to improve on both of these issues with a flexible ear hook for a secure fit and an integrated alloy that molds to the contours of your ear. It also has physical buttons for more precise control. It remains to be seen whether or these are an improvement over the predecessor.\nThe Swippit Hub is a device designed to charge your phone quickly. Shaped like a toaster, it stores 3,500-mAh batteries that stay charged. When your phone is on low battery, place it in the hub for a couple of seconds and pull it out when the light turns green. Voilà! Your phone is fully charged. There's one exception: You'll have to use the Swippit Link phone case (available for the iPhone 14, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16 at launch; Samsung Galaxy S23 and S24 cases will follow) along with it. Designed as a whole family solution, you can also use the companion app to see the status of both the Hub batteries and those in the Link cases. It's available for preorder, and the company is offering a CES discount ($100 off) until January 17.\nIf you couldn't already tell, smart glasses are very trendy right now. A startup called Halliday designed its own lenses in an attempt to reel in those who are on the fence about jumping on the trend. When you put them on, it projects a digital screen onto your eyeballs that appears as a small box in the upper-right corner of your vision. The screen displays text messages, media controls, and map directions. You can also ask the built-in AI system to summarize information for you, as well as use your daily routine to learn your habits before you do it (with permission). There's a smart ring too, which controls features on the glasses so that you don't have to use gesture controls. You can reserve them right now with a $10 deposit and complete your order toward the end of this month, and they'll ship in late March.\nChamelo’s (formerly Ampere) newest electrochromic lenses come with the ability to transition from dark to light with a manual slide, as well as an automatic tint mode that will adjust based on the light around you (including in your car, which is a tough task since windows block the UV rays that trigger conventional photochromic lenses to darken). The company has a few different styles coming later this week, but the Shield sunglasses are available for purchase (they're $50 off right now). They'll ship starting January 10.\nThe Reolink Duo 3 WiFi security camera is a dual-lens device with two 4K cameras that stitch together a full 180-degree view. You can zoom in for a clearer view of someone's face or to see a license plate number. It also supports dual-band Wi-Fi 6 (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz), so you can rest assured you'll have a more secure and reliable connection. There's also a Motion Track feature that shortens 15 seconds of recorded video into a single time-lapsed image, so you don't have to sort through footage.\nLutron's smart shades are now a bit more affordable. The company introduced its Caseta Smart Shades starting at $399, which cover shades up to 48 inches wide and 80 inches high (with larger options available at a higher cost). There are a few caveats though. The shades will last two years because it uses fewer D batteries (the higher-end version can last four to five), and there's no plug-in option. There are also fewer options when it comes to the type of shade you want, but you can choose between Roller or Honeycomb, white or gray, and light filtering or blackout fabric. They're available for purchase and will ship next month.\nElvie is widely known for its wearable, hands-free breast pumps. Now the company is entering a new product category: bassinets. But this isn't your standard bassinet; it's connected and filled with smart tech. Known as the Elvie Rise, it's a combo bouncer and bassient that can be controlled using your phone. With the companion app, you can stop, start, and adjust the bounce, auto-record time spent in the bassinet (it can detect when your baby is inside). It also can track your baby's sleep and provide insight into how their patterns are changing over time. It's available for preorder and will start shipping in March.\nThe new Orbi 870 Series is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 mesh system that can cover up to 9,000 square feet. The main router has a 10-Gbps Ethernet WAN port, while both the router and its satellites have four 2.5-Gbps Ethernet LAN ports each. We still recommend the more affordable 770 Series, which is in our to the best mesh systems. The 870 series will only benefit those with multi-gig internet and a large property.\nSightful's Spacetop AR laptop originally debuted in 2023 and, since then, has gone through multiple iterations. What started out as a pair of glasses, a full-size keyboard, and a touchpad is available as just AR glasses and a software subscription. The bundle comes with a pair of customized AR glasses from XREAL that you'll be able to connect to your PC (as long as it has an Intel Core Ultra 7/9 processor with Meteor Lake architecture or newer). Once you download the software, you'll have access to a 100-inch screen to display all your apps and windows. Included with your purchase is also a USB-C cable, adjustable nose pads, a carrying case, and a cleaning cloth. It will start shipping next month.\nRazer’s new Stand Chroma doubles as a stand for your monitor and a USB hub. You'll get two USB-A ports, a USB-C port, a USB-C input connection, an HDMI port, and a customizable Chroma RGB button. There's a slot where you can store your laptop, a book, or your fancy personalized stationary. The company also launched the Handheld Dock Chroma for handheld gaming consoles or tablets. It comes with a six-port design, 100-watt pass-through charging, and an adjustable hinge. It's available for preorder for $80.\nRobot vacuums are great until they reach obstacles like staircases or thresholds—at which point the annoying sensors go off. You won't run into this issue with the Dreame X50 though, which comes with retractable legs that can climb over obstacles up to 6 centimeters high. Other notable features include a detangling duo brush (which is ideal for vacuuming up hair), 20,000 Pascal of suction power, a 360-degree scanning sensor, support for voice commands, and it doubles as a mop. It's available for preorder.\nWe already like Panasonic's Technics EAH-AZ80 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) from 2023, so we have high hopes for the new EAH-AZ100 model. The fit and shape have been improved, so they're smaller and lighter (which should make them even more comfortable to wear for long periods), and they come with a new “medium-large” ear tip. In addition to adaptive noise cancellation, there's also a Voice Focus AI feature for calls that enhances noise reduction based on background noise. The company also incorporated a Magnetic Fluid Driver—a new proprietary technology designed to create what Panasonic says is “clean, high-resolution, low-vibration, and low-distortion sound for the most authentic and balanced audio.”\nThe Iskur V2 is our favorite gaming chair in our guide to Best Office Chairs. But the Iskur V2 X is a more affordable option. Of course that means you lose out on some features—the built-in lumbar arch isn't adjustable, and there's no PU leather option (only fabric). But at less than half the price of the V2, it could be a great option for those who don't want to spend close to $700 on a chair.\nHP's all-in-one desktop comes in two display sizes: 27-inch and 32-inch. The smaller model comes with the choice between a 1080p or 4K resolution screen, while the larger option is only available in 4K. You can also pick between touchscreen or non-touchscreen. It also comes equipped with a 5-megapixel webcam that you can hide when not in use, a built-in dual speaker system, and plenty of ports. As for processors, you can pair it with either an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor or an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor (up to 258V). As a CoPilot+ PC, it comes with AI-powered features too, like Recall, Windows Studio Effects, and Cocreate.\nThe HMD OffGrid is a compact, backcountry satellite communicator. It connects to the L band satellite radio spectrum to give your phone (Android or iPhone) 24/7 satellite connectivity via HMD's companion app. It also packs three days' worth of battery life and comes with a MIL-STD-810H durability rating, which means it survived super-harsh environmental tests. You'll have the choice between two subscription tiers: $80 a year for up to 350 messages or $140 a year for unlimited messaging.\nHP's OmniDesk series comes in three versions: the standard OmniDesk, the OmniDesk AI, and the OmniDesk Slim—all of which vary in processing power and price. The standard version offers the choice between an Intel Core (i3, i5, and i7 processors) and AMD Ryzen chips (Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7); the OmniDeesk AI packs the latest Intel Core Ultra processors; the OmniDesk Slim (which is the smallest and most compact of the three) can be configured with an Intel 300, Intel Core i3, Intel Core i5, or Intel Core i7. Each one also comes with a wireless keyboard and mouse. All three are available for preorder and will start shipping in February.\nIn addition to announcing new electric scooters, Segway also announced two new electric bikes: the Xyber and the Xafari. The Xyber, which is the higher-end of the two, comes with up 112 miles of range (with two 1,140-Wh batteries), hits up to 20 miles per hour, 175 Nm peak torque, and 6,000 watts of peak power. It also has 12 levels of power assist and three throttle modes (Eco, Sport, and Race). The Xafari, on the other hand, delivers up to 80 miles of range with 80 Nm torque and it's a bit more affordable coming in at $2,300. It's available for preorder only as of now.\nUnlike the Apple Watch–like aesthetic on an earlier version, Amazfit's Active 2 looks a lot more fashionable—with a round, stainless steel case, bright AMOLED display made of sapphire glass, and leather strap. In terms of features, it comes with free offline maps that you can download, improved sleep tracking sensors, and a new Strength Training mode. It can also autodetect up to 35 types of exercises and count your reps.\nDexcom's Stelo Glucose sensor is the first commercially available glucose monitor, which means it doesn't require a prescription (it's only for those who aren't on insulin, though). Attach it to your upper arm, and it'll continuously track your glucose levels to provide you with details on how food, sleep, and exercise impact it using the companion app. In addition to providing insights and tips, the app will also alert you when it detects a spike. The sensor is waterproof and offers up to 15 days of wear time. You'll get two sensors with your purchase, but you can also opt for a monthly subscription.\nSolos’ frames are equipped with Open AI's ChatGPT, so you can ask questions and also have it read your texts aloud to you. The frames come with speakers too, allowing you to play music or podcasts as well as take calls. They're modular, thanks to SmartHinge (it uses a USB-C connector port to connect the frames to the lenses), so you can mix and match the frames with different lenses whenever you get bored of the current style or want to better match your outfit. You can also swap out the lenses to switch between eyeglasses and sunglasses.\nGarmin's latest smartwatch packs an AMOLED screen, a built-in flashlight, a scratch-resistant display, and a metal-reinforced bezel. So, it's a great choice if you're looking for a rugged smartwatch that's also affordable and stylish. It's available in three versions. In addition to the Instinct 3, there's also the Instinct 3 Solar (which charges via solar power), and the Instinct E (more affordable at $300). You can preorder the Instinct 3 and and Instinct 3 Solar (with the choice between 45-mm and 50-mm sizes) at REI. All three models will be available for purchase through Garmin starting January 10.\nDexcom isn't the only company to launch a glucose monitor. There's also Abbot's Lingo. Simply place it in the dispenser, apply it to your upper arm, and bring your phone next to the sensor to connect it. From there, it'll monitor your glucose levels throughout the day—specifically any spikes. Each sensor will last two weeks. You can order one for $49, two for $89, or six for $249—all of which will give you access to the Lingo app. It’s worth noting that the Lingo is only compatible with iPhone.\nThis is an ideal accessory for anyone who relies on their phone for mobile gaming. It not only charges your device but will also cool it down as you play. Keeping temperatures as low as possible while using your phone is crucial for maintaining battery longevity.\nDoes your kid have a hard time chilling out? Try giving them a Moonbuddy—an adorable little device that guides kids through breathing exercises in an effort to teach them self-soothing techniques. All they have to do is press a button and pick an exercise. It's screen-free, app-free, and portable. You can pick between two versions: Barry the bear or Bibi the bird. The sleeves are easy to clean and changeable too.\nThe Q6 HE is one of Keychron’s brand new keyboards. The full-size mechanical keyboard comes complete with Hall Effect (HE) switches—making it an ideal option for gamers who need speedy and precise keys—as well as double-shot PBT keycaps and a NUM pad. Alongside the Q6 HE, Keychron also introduced the new Lemokey P1 HE keyboard. It comes with HE switches as well but is a bit more compact with a 75 percent layout, so it's slightly more affordable at $169. Both keyboards also come with a 4,000-mAh battery, USB-C connectivity, Bluetooth 5.2, and RGB backlighting.",

With <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/ces/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CES</a> coming to a close, we've seen a ton of cutting-edge tech, and we're only a week into 2025! A lot of the products announced at the show won't be available until later this year, but there are still plenty that are available to buy now.

The company also released the OnePlus 13R, which is a more affordable (and a bit less specced) model, but it goes on sale January 14 (you can preorder it now). Neither of the two phones comes with revolutionary improvements, but OnePlus did, of course, incorporate AI features—including an AI Editor in the Photos app, along with a suite of tools that can both summarize and read pages aloud. You'll also get four Android OS upgrades and six years of security updates. Unfortunately, there's no <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-qi2-wireless-charging/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Qi2 support</a>, and wireless charging is available only on the OnePlus 13.

    "content_text": "Sarah Jones was 11 hours and 49 minutes into her 12-hour shift as an emergency dispatcher for the county sheriff in Spokane, Washington, when she received what she would later describe as the worst phone call of her life.\nIt was a Wednesday morning in May 2023, around 10 o’clock, when the call—from someone who identified himself only as “Wayne”—came in via a publicly listed regional emergency line. “I’m going to walk into Central Valley High School in Veradale with my AK-47,” Wayne told the operator who first picked up. The voice was unnaturally deep, slow, so claustrophobically close to the microphone that its breath seemed to fill the line. “I’m going to kill everyone I see.”\nThat operator transferred him to Jones (WIRED has changed her name at her request), a 42-year-old, red-headed mother of three. Jones’ office at the Spokane Regional Emergency Center was chronically understaffed, so she’d been working overtime through that night and morning, drinking Dunkin’ Donuts–branded coffee from the office’s Keurig machine amid the usual marathon of domestic violence and reckless driving reports. Jones had spent years taking 911 calls; only that week she’d been promoted to “law dispatch,” a position that included dealing with callers carrying out crimes in progress—“hot calls,” as dispatchers referred to them. This would be her first.\nWhen Jones read the message from the operator that accompanied Wayne’s transfer, she realized with a rush of adrenaline that she was speaking to an active school shooter, and that she had seconds to persuade this stranger not to carry out his plan.\n“Hi. Wayne? What’s going on?” Jones asked calmly, taming her racing heartbeat.\n“It’s too complicated,” the voice drawled, so grotesque that Jones initially thought the sound might be recorded from a horror movie. “All you need to know is that I want cops here as soon as possible. Because after I kill everyone I see, I want to kill cops too.”\n“Wayne,” Jones answered, drawing out the name this time and affecting her most sympathetic and motherly tone. “Are you in front of the school right now?”\n“Yes, I’m walking in now.”\n“OK, can you stop, please?” Jones said, her words accelerating as desperation crept into her voice.\nThe only answer was a series of rapid staccato blasts: automatic gunfire.\n“Shots heard, Andrea! Shots heard!” Jones called out to her supervisor, her voice now cracking with emotion.\nA few feet away, Jones’ supervisor, Andrea Lombard, watched Jones put down the phone “as if it were on fire,” as she would later describe it. The caller had hung up; the entire conversation had lasted 45 seconds. Lombard (not her real last name) had already sent out an emergency alert to all police in the region—a high-pitched tone followed by her warning that a school shooting was in progress. More than 50 units, sirens blazing, were on their way to Central Valley High School.\nAs Jones tried to call the shooter back—“Come on, come on, come on, answer,” she pleaded—Lombard looked at a map and saw that, just a block and a half from the high school, there was a children’s day care. She called and reached the day care’s assistant director, who was outside in the yard with a group of 1-year-olds.\nIn a quick, controlled voice, Lombard explained that there had been shots fired at the nearby high school and they needed to lock down. The assistant director let out a kind of involuntary wail, then shouted “Get inside!” as she moved to scoop up as many babies as she could carry and run with them into the building.\nLombard quickly hung up and tuned in to police radio communications, listening as officers armed with rifles began to enter Central Valley High School. They moved through its hallways, guns drawn, as teachers barricaded doorways and students hid inside locked, dark classrooms, crouching in silence.\nThis was not Lombard’s first school shooting. In 2017, she had listened to the same radio chatter as Spokane law enforcement entered a different local high school after a 15-year-old boy shot four classmates. The words of the officer who first came upon one young victim, who would die of his wounds that day, still echoed in Lombard’s memory, his voice breaking as he radioed the news to the rest of the officers.\nNow she sat in the dispatch office next to Jones, listening to the radio, waiting with dread to hear that sound again.\nInstead, as dozens of officers moved through the school that May morning, they found—nothing. The school resources officer who had been posted near the school’s entrance radioed to the police line that he’d seen no sign of a shooter entering. Nor had he heard the automatic gunfire that Jones described.\nSlowly, Lombard’s dread gave way to anger. Could the call have been a hoax? As she and hundreds of students and teachers sat in silence, still fearing the worst, two questions entered her mind that she would still be asking herself more than a year later.\nWho would do something like this? And why?\nThe chaos, the fear, the dread and immense disruption triggered by that one haunting voice on the phone wasn’t targeted at Spokane alone. The call was one of dozens that a person who went by the online handle Torswats would make to law enforcement, targeting schools across Washington state over a little more than 24 hours.\nIn some calls, the person told dispatchers he wanted to kill students for Satan. In others, he said it was because he was new to town and people treated him “like shit.” In others still, like the one to Spokane, he seemed to have become bored enough with the game that he didn’t bother to make up a reason. Armed with little more than his monstrous voice, an internet-based calling application routed through an anonymous proxy server, and a recording of gunfire taken from the video game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Torswats terrorized half the state, paralyzing schools, weaponizing civilians’ own police forces against them, temporarily shutting down entire communities, again and again and again.\nTorswats crossed off counties on a screenshotted map of Washington as he targeted one school after another, then posted the screenshots in a private Telegram channel between calls. He boasted that he aimed to hit at least one school in every county in the state and tallied the tens of millions of dollars in disruption he hoped to inflict. “It was funny as allf uck. SHOTS HEARD,” he joked at one point, seeming to mock Jones specifically.\n“2/3rds done with washington,” he wrote, then bragged about making a bomb threat against the Pentagon. “There’s nothing I can’t do.”\nIn fact, over the previous year, Torswats had been tormenting schools all over the country. He was the most active player in a loosely linked network of young trolls who made hundreds of “swatting” calls—hoaxes designed to send heavily armed police to a victim’s door—and bomb threats that triggered mass evacuations.\nAt a Michigan high school, a police officer had responded to one swatter’s call by ramming his cruiser through the school’s locked front doors. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, an officer fired a round from his gun when he was sent into a university following one hoax call. In other swattings, students hid in janitors’ closets, so scared to move that they urinated in mop buckets before armed officers pulled them out, hands above their heads, to frisk them for weapons. One family member in Texas reportedly lacerated his arm trying to break into a locked-down school to rescue a child.\nIn the midst of that months-long reign of terror, Torswats had distinguished himself as perhaps the most prolific American school swatter in history. And throughout all of it, federal law enforcement was well aware of the chaos Torswats was inflicting. For months, the FBI had possessed everything it needed to unmask him. In fact, the agency already knew Torswats’ real name and address. But it had still done nothing to stop him—a fact that was particularly appalling to the man who had practically handed Torswats’ identity to the FBI: a lone private investigator living outside Seattle named Brad Dennis.\nAs Torswats carried out his swatting campaign across Washington in May 2023, Dennis watched it all unfold on his computer screen. He saw the maps Torswats shared on Telegram, where he crossed out counties in Dennis’ state as he targeted schools in each one. A pale, bearish, baby-faced 36-year-old, Dennis was chilled to realize that he was personally familiar with some of these schools; he’d been to them for track meets when he was a teenager.\nFor months leading up to that May swatting offensive, Dennis had been tracing Torswats’ online footprints, tracking down his various social media accounts, meticulously tying those clues to real-world identifying information and sharing the results with law enforcement. Even after he’d given the FBI everything he thought the agency could possibly need to arrest Torswats, Dennis couldn’t stop monitoring the swatter’s every move. Working from a corner of his one-bedroom apartment, lit only by two dim red and blue lamps on either side of his couch, he had become almost a mirror image of his target: as fixated on taking the swatter down as Torswats was on his malevolent hobby. And now he couldn’t help but feel like it was the swatter who was closing in on him.\nBy May 2023, Torswats had come to occupy nearly all of Dennis’ waking hours. As spring turned to summer, those hours would become nocturnal, as they did every year, when Dennis sought refuge from the anxiety of heat, traffic, and other people. For days at a time, he was so isolated from other human beings that his only real-world companions were the neighborhood squirrels—Jackie, Jesse, Alvin, Doug—that he’d trained to visit his apartment by feeding them peanuts. When he wasn’t at his desk, which he sometimes cordoned off from the rest of his apartment by a blackout curtain, Dennis would speed down highways along the Puget Sound in his Honda Civic late at night to clear his mind.\nVisions of Torswats haunted him at every turn. “It was very difficult to live with every day: that he’s out there, and I physically can’t do anything about it,” Dennis says. “I knew how many people he was terrorizing all over the country.”\nYet when Dennis imagined Torswats, whose face he’d never seen, he actually pictured someone else: a hulking young hacker with short, dark hair—an altogether different delinquent who, 15 years earlier, had sent a caravan of police cars full of heavily armed officers to Dennis’ own childhood home, altering the course of his life.\nWhen Dennis was growing up in the Seattle suburbs in the early 1990s, his mother would sometimes bring him to her office, where she worked as a secretary for the county’s emergency services. He liked wandering into the cavernous room where the dispatchers worked, examining the computer systems and radio equipment, sensing both their technical complexity and the life-and-death work that depended on it.\nBut rather than a dispatcher, Dennis was destined to be a hacker. When he was just 4 years old, his mother installed an alarm on the fridge door to keep him from raiding it for Diet Cokes. Dennis learned that he could remove the alarm’s batteries, then quietly replace them after he’d taken the soda. When he was 6, his mother bought a Hewlett-Packard PC, and Dennis spent the next years compulsively pressing every button and clicking every option in every software menu for hours. By the time he was a preteen, his mother started taking the keyboard away at night, hiding it in her bedroom to limit his computer time. Dennis would silently army-crawl into the dark room to retrieve it without waking her up.\nTechnology became an escape from the poverty of Dennis’ childhood: His father came in and out of his life through a “revolving door,” he remembers. And at times, he says, his mother seemed unable to provide him emotional support, even as she worried herself sick about his well-being. Growing up in a crime-ridden and drug-plagued suburb of Seattle, several of Dennis’ childhood friends would later struggle with meth and opiates or be killed in narcotics-related murders. “A lot of the people I grew up with ended up hooked on drugs,” Dennis says. “I got hooked on computers.”\nBy the time he was 11 years old, Dennis was texting with professional cybercriminals on the early chat protocol IRC. When he was 12, he says, he gained access to 400,000 credit cards insecurely stored by a software company. His brother, Bryan, remembers electronics and toys showing up at their house, stuff they could never afford. At one point, Dennis told Bryan, grinning, that he had hacked into the White House communications network and obtained a list of phone numbers. Bryan rolled his eyes. Dennis showed him a phone number and Bryan dialed it. Someone picked up with a brisk “Situation Room.”\nIn 10th grade, Dennis learned about a vulnerability in Windows that would have allowed him to gain administrator access on school computers and change students’ grades. Showing off the trick at school, a teacher saw over Dennis’ shoulder that he was browsing a forbidden part of the school network. He was fed up with school anyway, and dropped out before he could face any consequences.\nAround 2007, when he was 19, Dennis met a hacker named Dshocker on IRC, and the two developed a system for cleverly exploiting stolen and leaked credit card numbers: They’d order something via UPS and send it to the cardholder’s own address to skirt fraud detection. Then a contact Dshocker had at UPS would use his access to the company’s system to reroute the package to one of their own addresses.\nIt was a lucrative connection. But Dennis was dismayed to discover that Dshocker was also interested in more malevolent forms of hacking. He turned out to be an early practitioner of swatting, sending armed police to anyone who wronged him and even arbitrary targets. The fact that Dshocker knew Dennis’ own home address because of their shipping scheme made him deeply uneasy.\nOver his years dabbling in blackhat hacking, Dennis says he’d received occasional, unfriendly visits from law enforcement, including at least one from the Secret Service. This time, he says, he approached the FBI with information about Dshocker and helped the agency identify Dshocker’s online accounts. The hacker had made the mistake of logging in to one without masking his home IP address. Dshocker turned out to be Nathan Hanshaw, a 17-year-old in Massachusetts. Hanshaw was charged, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 11 months in juvenile detention—but not before sending a team of police with loaded weapons into Dennis’ home.\nOn that day in 2008, Dennis was in his bedroom when the cops rapped on the door of his family’s double-wide trailer and pulled his confused mother out at gunpoint. Dennis was so immersed in his computer, with his headphones on, that he hadn’t even heard the sirens of the Snohomish County Sheriff’s cruisers tearing down the block of his quiet neighborhood. Only the sound of a man yelling his name from behind his bedroom door yanked Dennis into reality: He opened the door to see a sheriff’s deputy brandishing an AR-15.\nDennis was cuffed and pushed onto the couch in the living room. He tried to explain to the crowd of heavily armed and armored police officers that he had been swatted. That he knew exactly who had placed the false 911 call. That he was, in fact, working with FBI agents investigating a serial swatter named Dshocker. That whatever crime in progress Dshocker had described was a lie. But sitting in his gym shorts with his hands cuffed behind his back, it all seemed futile: Dennis heard the police describe him to each other using the police code for a mentally ill individual. They threatened to arrest him if he didn’t stop talking.\nThe standoff ended only when Dennis asked an officer to go into his room and find his wallet. Inside it was the business card of an FBI agent with whom he’d been sharing information about Dshocker. The cops called the number, talked to Dennis’ contact, uncuffed him, and drove away, leaving Dennis and his shell-shocked mother in silence.\nDennis’ mother would blame him for that horrific disruption in their lives, his brother would later remember. She saw it as another indirect result of his all-consuming computer obsession.\nFor Dennis, the swatting incident would leave him “scarred,” anxious, suffering from panic attacks for years. He still believes Hanshaw never knew he was helping the FBI to track him down. So why would Dshocker swat his own hacking partner, traumatizing him and his mother? Dennis would eventually arrive at an explanation that he now sees as the common denominator among serial swatters: “He did it because he could.”\nAfter that swatting, Dennis knew he needed to quit the cybercriminal world. His hacking schemes, too, were growing in scale; he felt that if he didn’t walk away, he’d eventually end up in prison. But it would take Dennis years longer to extricate himself, a process that involved leaving behind essentially all of his friends.\nAfter a series of odd jobs through his twenties, from network administrator to warehouse muscle, he eventually found work as a skip tracer, tracking down missing people, and then as a repo man. Dennis found that these private investigator gigs suited his skills as a hacker—persistently hunting through datasets for the tiniest clue about someone, pivoting from connection to connection until he could locate them and lure them into the open.\nHis go-to trick for repossessing cars was the classic honeypot: Create a social media profile posing as an attractive young woman, catfish the target into meeting at a restaurant, then seize their car in the parking lot while they waited for their imaginary date inside. Dennis says he learned from those encounters how the prospect of a sufficiently enticing reward—namely, sex—can switch off a target’s rationality. “You temporarily overload their brain with excitement,” he says, “and you can then get them to do things.”\nEventually he transitioned to the lower-stakes field of tracking down the subjects of divorce proceedings and lawsuits to hand them legal papers. But Dennis, an anxious and private person, hated the work of physically confronting often-dangerous deadbeats. Then, in 2020, the pandemic hit. Courts closed. Unhappily married people held off on divorces. His work dried up. He sold his car to give himself time to establish a new line of employment.\nOne of Dennis’ favorite Twitch streamers at the time was a gaming celebrity who’d been careful never to reveal his location to millions of fans. On a lark, while casting about for another livelihood, Dennis checked to see if he could track the streamer down using his skip-tracing skills and some scant online breadcrumbs. When he succeeded, he decided to approach the Twitch celebrity and offer to help him clean up his digital profile. Dennis says the streamer took him up on the offer and hired him as a security consultant—then began to refer him to other Twitch streamers. By early 2022, he had around half a dozen clients.\nAs Dennis expanded his Twitch connection into a budding career, he came to realize that swatting, a source of his own trauma, had plagued video game streamers for years. In many cases, Twitch stars had even been swatted in the midst of their livestreams, thrown to the ground by cops and held at gunpoint.\nA few months later, one prominent streamer was brutally swatted—pulled out of his home by police with guns drawn while his wife and baby were inside—and reached out to Dennis for help. Within a week, Dennis’ original Twitch streamer client was hit too. The two streamers pooled together a five-figure sum to hire Dennis as their private investigator, asking him to find out who was responsible.\nDennis had never expected to be drawn back into the swatting underworld—one that he had, in fact, spent years working to escape. But he felt he now had a duty to protect his clients. And, he told himself, he had helped the FBI identify a serial swatter before. Maybe he had the right skills to hunt this one too.\n“I believed,” he says, “that I was the perfect person to take this guy down.”\nDennis’ detective work began with a post he found on Doxbin—an anarchic, fully unmoderated bulletin board where hackers frequently publish the private information of their victims or rivals to incite harassment. One user, “Ringwraith,” had published a data dump that included an address for Dennis’ first Twitch client, along with the address and phone number of the streamer’s 75-year-old father.\n“I am not responsible for what happens with this info,” Ringwraith added with mock innocence. In other posts to Doxbin, the same account had broadcast the home addresses of other targets and suggested that users enlist “prank call” services available on the messaging platform Telegram to troll them.\nDennis began scouring Telegram and quickly found one such “prank call” service with the name Nazgul’s Swats. He knew his Lord of the Rings references well enough to understand that the Nazgûl, in Tolkien’s world, are synonymous with Ringwraiths: ghostly, lethal figures that hunt the saga’s heroes from the shadowy realm they inhabit. Were Ringwraith and Nazgul in fact the same person?\nNazgul’s Swats, whose profile photo on Telegram showed a black-hooded skull mask, seemed to be openly advertising a swatting-for-hire service. The account priced its calls at $150 per swat or bomb threat, or $100 for hoax gas leaks or fires, to be paid for with the tracing-resistant cryptocurrency Monero. “All swats will be done ASAP,” Nazgul wrote. “Prices will be negotiated if it’s a major target like a semi-famous streamer or a government building.”\nAs he watched Nazgul’s Telegram account over the summer of 2022, Dennis was dismayed to see that the swatting service appeared to be shifting its focus from Twitch streamers to a more disturbing target: schools. In August of that year, the account posted a “Back-to-School Sale,” with a special rate of just $50 in Monero for school swattings. “Do you want an extra day of summer break?” the post read. “I will shut down a school for the entire day!”\nNot long after, on Telegram, Nazgul began posting audio recordings of school swatting calls. In one, targeting a high school near Toronto, the swatter claimed to be a supporter of QAnon, intent on destroying the school with explosives because of the “pedophile transgender” teachers there. In another, the swatter told an emergency hotline they were transgender and had been mocked by their fellow students at their high school in Washington state, and had taken their father’s glock.\n“I’m in the bathroom now, and I’m ready to take out the people who bullied me,” the swatter told the dispatcher through a robotic, synthesized voice generated by a Google text-to-speech program. “The transphobes will die.”\nTwo days later, Nazgul called again, this time telling dispatchers the earlier call had been a hoax meant to throw off the response to the actual school shooting now planned at the same high school that day. “It is too late for you to stop me. I have an illegally modified, fully auto AR-15 and glock with level-four body armor, and I’m right outside the school gates ready to shoot up your faggot-infested school,” the caller said. He claimed that he had planted pipe bombs under administrators’ cars and in classrooms that would detonate minutes after school started. “Afterwards I will walk in and shoot everyone I see. Goodbye.”\nThe school swatting calls that Nazgul was posting to Telegram were only part of a growing wave hitting schools across the US in the fall of 2022, including more than a dozen hoax calls each in Minnesota, Louisiana, and Virginia. By November, the attacks had swelled to more than a hundred, hitting New Jersey, Florida, California, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Connecticut, seemingly at random. Dennis read news reports in which law enforcement officials blamed the calls on a group of Ethiopians. But he suspected that many of the swattings seemed to be the work of Nazgul alone.\nDennis reached out to an FBI field office in San Antonio, the closest location to one of his Twitch clients, in an attempt to persuade the bureau to investigate Nazgul. Identifying himself as a licensed private investigator, he described what he’d found in a breathless, point-by-point, 897-word email, laying out the evidence of how dangerous this particular swatter was becoming—and throwing in a few initial theories of the swatter’s real-world identity that, he now admits, were all off base.\nThe San Antonio FBI eventually responded: It had no open case into Nazgul’s Swats, didn’t intend to create one, and didn’t even offer Dennis a point of contact for any future findings, he says. “They gave me nothing at all,” Dennis says. “Nothing.”\nDennis was incensed. As he read news reports of the hoax calls sending schools into lockdown, terrorizing parents and children across the country, he began to feel like he was shouldering the full weight of the investigation. As long as Nazgul was free, it seemed, he would keep targeting more innocent victims. “From the moment he woke up till the moment he went to sleep, he was swatting people,” Dennis says. “And I was going to do whatever it took to catch him.”\nEd Dorroh, a bearded and slightly grizzled detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, was out for dinner with his wife at a romantic wine bar in his hometown of Lancaster, California, when he got a text from a number he didn’t recognize. The sender identified himself as a private investigator, a stranger who wanted Dorroh’s help pursuing what he described as one of the worst serial swatters in history.\nDorroh had famously taken down a notorious swatter named Tyler Barriss, who placed a 2017 hoax call that resulted in the fatal police shooting of a man in Wichita, Kansas. Dennis knew Dorroh would understand the gravity of his case. Dorroh, for his part, did a quick background check from his phone to make sure Dennis was a legitimate PI, to the annoyance of his wife across the table.\nThe next day he called Dennis, who immediately began to share a deluge of information that conveyed his obsession with Nazgul and his frustration with the FBI’s inaction. Dorroh knew the feeling: He’d often found it difficult to impress the seriousness of swatting cases on his fellow law enforcement agents. He’d once tracked a swatter to the UK who had threatened to have Dorroh’s own family killed, then sent his findings on the suspect to a British agent—only to wait six months for the investigator to even look at the case. Dorroh agreed to help.\nA week or two later, Dorroh searched through a law enforcement database with Dennis on the phone and found that the FBI’s Bellingham, Washington, field office did have an open case on Nazgul’s Swats. He connected Dennis with a responsive agent there named Rachel Bennett (not her real name). Dennis was mystified that the San Antonio office hadn’t told him about the investigation. But from talking to Bennett, it seemed to Dennis that the FBI still had virtually nothing on Nazgul. (The FBI asked WIRED to anonymize the names of its case agents, out of concern that they could be swatted in retaliation.)\nAs he badgered the FBI, Dennis began the long, patient process of insinuating himself into Nazgul’s inner circle—a familiar practice from his years of hunting car-payment debtors and vanished spouses. He created the persona of an aggrieved ex-husband obsessed with revenge following his divorce. Under the guise of that potential customer, he began sending initial messages to Nazgul’s Telegram account, telling him he might need his help at some point and would be willing to pay.\nWhile Dennis searched for any revealing slip-up Nazgul might make, he would emerge into the light of the real world only to eat and caffeinate or to feed the squirrels that visited his apartment. At one point in his hunting, Dennis began to believe that Nazgul might belong to a certain “guild” in the online game World of Warcraft. Dennis became so determined to gain entry to that elite gaming group that he paid more than $1,000 to buy a leveled-up warlock character in the game, asked one of his gaming streamer clients to help him train, and spent more than 80 hours playing WoW to build credibility.\nBut by the winter holidays of 2022, none of this months-long undercover work had borne fruit. Dennis knew he needed to change tactics.\nAt some point, Dennis had read about an encrypted texting program called Tox. Although many hackers liked the service’s security features, its peer-to-peer architecture meant that it could leak users’ IP addresses to whichever contact they were chatting with, the equivalent of a phone call that revealed the address of the caller’s home. Perhaps this combination of apparent security and actual vulnerability offered exactly the trap Dennis needed.\nOn the night of New Year’s Eve, Dennis opened Wireshark, a program for intercepting and deconstructing network communications. Then he messaged Nazgul on Telegram using his aggrieved ex-husband persona.\n“Yo, got some bidness to talk to you about,” he typed to the swatter at 9:19 pm. This was the bait he’d lured in front of Nazgul for months, suggesting that he was going to pay grandly for some climactic act of swatting vengeance targeting his ex-wife. “You wanna make some real cash. Add me on Tox.”\nDennis hit Return. Thinking back to the honeypot stings that had worked so well in his days as a repo man, he hoped the promise of a big payday would short-circuit his target’s defense instincts. To help ward off any doubts, Dennis went to Wikipedia and carefully deleted a paragraph mentioning the IP-leaking bug from the page for the Tox protocol. Then he waited.\nLess than an hour later, a notification popped up on his screen: A user named “Paimon Arnum” wanted to chat on Tox. The username was unfamiliar to Dennis. But he knew who it must be. As he accepted the chat invitation, Wireshark began capturing dozens of network requests. All of them came from a single IP address.\nDennis had his breakthrough. A fresh pseudonym tied to Nazgul’s Swats and what he believed was an actual IP address might be revelatory new threads for him and the FBI to pull on.\nNot long after, Nazgul’s Swats added yet another moniker to the mix, inexplicably changing his Telegram username. Dennis didn’t know whether this additional handle was a reference to the anonymity software Tor—which the swatter didn’t appear to use—or to a Norwegian spelling of the Norse thunder god Thor. But from then on, Nazgul would go by a new name: Torswats.\nIn late January 2023, Brad Dennis watched through his Ring camera as two FBI agents stepped onto his doormat that read “COME BACK WITH A WARRANT” and rang his doorbell. He opened the door, which was affixed with a sticker that read “BEWARE OF DOG,” though Dennis had never owned one.\nDennis and the two visitors, FBI special agents Rachel Bennett and Lucas Phillips (also not his real name), sat down around a beat-up coffee table. On it was a large, tattered copy of the 9/11 Commission Report, Dennis’ only coffee-table book. The only decoration on the walls was an American flag hung behind a desk chair. Nearly a month after the holidays, a fake Christmas tree with a single ornament in the shape of a pickle stood in a corner of the room. Resting against it were two printed photos of Dennis’ favorite squirrels, Jesse and Alvin, gifts from his mother.\nDennis did almost all of the talking, briefing the two FBI agents on his months of detective work. In fact, he couldn’t stop talking: He had just drunk a Red Bull and was far too caffeinated. At one point Phillips noticed World of Warcraft on Dennis’ computer screen and commented that he played the game too. Throughout the meeting, some of Dennis’ squirrels hung out on the patio, munching on unsalted peanuts.\nWhen the two agents left Dennis’ apartment 45 minutes later, they carried with them a USB drive that contained the network data Dennis had captured with Wireshark, documenting the IP address leaked in his Tox chat conversation with Nazgul.\nDennis sensed that the Paimon Arnum handle—a possible reference to one of the kings of hell in demonological texts—was also a powerful data point. The FBI hadn’t known about the new name until he shared it with them. When Dennis had searched for Paimon Arnum, he found a YouTube account with the same username. Checking an archived copy of the account, he found that it had once been named Ringwraith and had used a similar Nazgul picture as its profile image. Even if the IP address he’d shared with the FBI was some sort of proxy that Torswats had used to cover his tracks, he thought perhaps a subpoena to Google could reveal this account’s subscriber information. More than ever before, Dennis felt real hope they had solid leads on their target.\nIn the weeks that followed, Dennis and Agent Phillips would text and email each other updates. But as the weeks went on, Dennis started to get impatient. He called Phillips to ask about the subpoenas to Google and other services Torswats had used.\nAs Dennis recalls it, Phillips told him that the results still hadn’t come back. Dennis asked how it could be taking so long: Hadn’t Phillips filed emergency requests? Google and other major tech firms typically responded to those in a day or less. According to Dennis, Phillips said that he had filed the requests as normal subpoenas, explaining that was the bureau’s policy, and this wasn’t necessarily an emergency case.\nDennis blew up. You motherfucker, he remembers thinking. For months he had been watching TikTok videos of school swattings, torturing himself with clips that students had recorded and posted of themselves hiding in school bathrooms and jumping over fences to escape from imagined shooters. “He’s literally sending out police officers to people’s houses and into schools with their guns drawn,” he says he told Phillips. “How is this not an emergency?”\nNot long after, Phillips told Dennis that he had sent the emergency requests. The FBI agent soon began to share hints of the results with Dennis. Sure enough, the bureau now had an IP address for the Google account, one that located the user at a residential internet connection in California.\nIt seemed the FBI now knew Torswats’ name and address, though Phillips wouldn’t share those details with Dennis. It was only a matter of time, Dennis now felt, until the target of his hunt was behind bars.\nIn the meantime, Phillips had asked for Dennis’ help in locating and then infiltrating a channel on the chat service Discord that Torswats visited. The group, an offshoot of a larger movement that called itself 764, turned out to be one of the most disturbing and abhorrent corners of the internet, catering to its most callous trolls and sadists. Its members, from what Dennis could tell, seemed to be constantly working to outdo one another with racist memes, child sexual abuse images, animal cruelty clips, and sextortion videos in which members of the group blackmailed children into humiliating or harming themselves, sometimes with razor blades or nooses shipped in the mail to their victims.\nDennis says he saw things in the channel that he wishes he could remove from his memory, that make him physically sick to recall, including one image of child sexual abuse that has horrifically and unpredictably flashed into his mind every day since. “I didn’t even know this kind of evil existed,” he says.\nDennis stumbled into darker and darker layers of the internet as he stalked Torswats, all the while waiting for updates from the FBI on when exactly the swatter would be arrested or have his computers seized. At one point Phillips told Dennis that the FBI wanted to be “extra careful.” But Dennis was beginning to lose his patience and his trust that the bureau was taking the case seriously.\n“I can’t believe he’s just walking around free. Even tho we know who he is. Please for the love of god just take him down already FBI,” Dennis wrote to a WIRED reporter on May 6, 2023. “They have enough for the warrant. Good. Write it. Execute it. Done. Every day they wait is more kids being hurt.”\nFive days later, on the morning of May 11, Tanner Zahrt, the principal of Port Angeles High School, on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, heard the scream of sirens approaching. Moments later, an assistant principal came into Zahrt’s office and told him that the police had just called: An active shooter was on the school grounds.\nZahrt scrambled across the hall to the room where the school’s intercom was set up. He spoke into the microphone, trying to broadcast a message telling the school to lock down. Silence. The intercom system wasn’t working. As fast as they could, he and the assistant principal assembled the school’s administrators and asked for volunteers to run to the school’s 13 buildings—a uniquely sprawling, tough-to-secure outdoor campus—and deliver the lockdown warning. Zahrt knew he was asking these volunteers to risk their lives. But he felt he had no other option: Every second might mean more students’ lives lost.\nWhen the volunteers dispersed, Zahrt ran back to the intercom. After several minutes, he got it to sputter to life. “There’s a threat on campus. We’re going into lockdown, this is not a drill,” Zahrt said into the microphone, trying to keep his voice calm. “Lockdown, lockdown, lockdown.”\nPolice officers soon arrived in Zahrt’s office and played the recording of the 911 call that had brought them: The same deep, languid voice that police dispatchers would hear in a dozen or more counties by the end of that day. Torswats had, by this point, stopped using the text-to-speech software for his swattings; he had discovered his own ghostly and unnerving voice was far more effective and credible. Each call was a variation on the same theme: “I’m going into the school with an AK-47”—or an AR-15, or a glock, or pipe bombs—“and I’m going to kill everyone I see.”\nThe recording Zahrt heard ended with the sound of a school bell. He immediately recognized that it was the wrong one. “That’s not our school bell,” he thought. But even as he began to suspect a hoax, the officers warned him that it wouldn’t yet be safe to give the all-clear.\nInstead, for the next 50 minutes, teachers barricaded their classrooms as students hid in “hard corners,” out of any potential shooter’s sight lines, while police carrying automatic rifles scoured the school, classroom by classroom. Some students, jaded from false alarms and drills, joked and texted with friends. Others hid in silence. Some, says Zahrt, had panic attacks.\nBy this point, Torswats had moved into the second day of his blitz against the state of Washington, a target area he’d seemingly chosen at random. It was the culmination of a spree that had begun 24 hours earlier with the eastern part of the state—including the “shots heard!” call to Spokane.\nFor Sarah Jones, the trauma of that call lingered well beyond the hour it had taken for police to officially declare a false alarm. When her shift was finally over, Jones had burst into tears in the arms of her supervisor. On her drive home, she couldn’t stop crying. That weekend she went on a run to try to exorcize the sound of Torswats’ horrifying voice. But she says she can still hear it, even now, a year and a half later. She says she’ll remember the call “for the rest of my career.”\nAll told, Torswats hit as many as 45 schools in Washington state—then moved on to new targets. As he did, his hoaxes grew more florid in their descriptions and graphic in the horror of the threats he was inventing.\n“I just finished reading the devil’s Koran,” he told one dispatcher as he explained why he was about to commit a mass shooting at a mosque in Florida with an “illegally modified, fully auto AR-15” as well as a glock and Molotov cocktails. “It is a false mosque that prays to the demi-urge Saturn,” he added, before hitting his usual last note that he was about to “kill everyone I see.”\n“I took DMT this morning. And I saw Satan,” Torswats told another young woman a few days later after she picked up the phone at Prairie View A&M University in Texas, one in a series of historically black colleges and universities that he had added to his target list. “And he came to me in the form of a serpent. And he told me to put explosives—he told me to put the fragmentation pipe bombs I had made for him inside of stuffed animals that resemble snakes, and he told me to put them in the ceilings and in the trash cans around campus. There are about two dozen total.”\nIn the midst of another call that spring, this time with a high school resource officer in Maryland, the officer interrupted Torswats in the middle of a bomb threat and told him he would find his IP address and make sure he was criminally charged.\nIn response, Torswats paused, seeming to break character and stifle ecstatic laughter.\n“I am never going to be caught,” he said finally, his voice swelling as if he were almost moved to tears. “I am invincible.”\nDennis’ work was over. He had, he felt, given the FBI what it needed to close the case. Yet he was still watching Torswats post evidence of his ongoing, near-daily swattings to Telegram. The mental dissonance had become almost unbearable.\nAs the waiting wore on into summer, he began his annual transition to nocturnal life. He went for walks on the trail behind his apartment, sometimes in pitch-black so complete that he couldn’t see his hand in front of his face. On his nighttime drives, he says he’d sometimes reach speeds of 145 miles per hour, so fast that other cars on the highway seemed to be standing still.\nAll the while, Torswats was still escalating. By July, he’d begun to write on Telegram about something he called “the Grand Offensive”: He posted an incoherent chart of his planned targets, including 25 senators, the FBI, the Pentagon, and the board of directors of the asset management firm BlackRock. “One Swatter to Rule Them All,” his chart read in one corner. He followed up that graphic with a rambling, racist, antisemitic manifesto written as an ironic ode to US law enforcement. “They are the guardians of our luciferian light, the defenders of justice, and the pillars of our society,” it read. “God bless America’s sword of domestic combat to preserve its judeogovernance.”\nAround 10 am one morning in July, Dennis was coming out of the drive-through at Taco Time, one of few restaurants in the area that would serve him dinner food at a normal person’s breakfast time. His phone rang. It was Phillips. Dennis took the call on speakerphone without pulling over.\nAn FBI team, Phillips told him, had just executed a search warrant at Torswats’ home in Lancaster, California—by coincidence the very same town that had been home to the veteran LA detective Ed Dorroh, Dennis’ first fruitful contact in law enforcement. The agents had given their suspect the full SWAT treatment, Phillips told Dennis: A Bearcat armored vehicle had torn the door off its hinges. Agents had used flash-bang grenades to surprise and stun everyone inside the home before searching it and seizing Torswats’ PC.\nThe computer was encrypted, Phillips told Dennis, and might be useless for obtaining evidence. But Dennis was nonetheless thrilled that the same militarized police apparatus that Torswats had weaponized for a year had finally hit him back with karmic retribution.\nPhillips was there at the raid, he told Dennis. Torswats had turned out to be a teenager, he said, and Phillips had heard his voice: The slow, deep, almost sedated drawl that had become all too familiar to both of them. There was no mistaking that they had found him—though after searching the house and seizing his computers, they still didn’t arrest him.\nAt the end of the nearly 40-minute conversation, Dennis says, Phillips informed him that the Department of Justice planned to shop the case around the country to find a district willing to charge the suspect as a minor—possibly in Texas, Oklahoma, or Florida.\nDennis arrived home, sat down at his desk, ate his chicken burrito, and texted one of the Twitch streamers who had first hired him to hunt Torswats. “Search warrant was executed this morning,” he wrote. “Mission accomplished.”\n“LOL. Fuck Em. What a relief,” the client wrote back.\n“Serves him right, little shit,” Dennis responded.\nHe finished the burrito. At 1 pm, he finally went to bed, happy and fulfilled for the first time since he’d taken the case more than a year earlier.\nExcept Torswats was still free—and somehow, still online.\n“My current plan is that I will be temporarily retiring for several weeks,” he wrote, just a few days after the raid, on a new account titled The Actual Fourth Reich of Torswats, adding that he would probably start offering his services on a dark-web marketplace in the winter of that year. Then he seemed to disappear for months.\nWithin a few weeks, Dennis’ sense of victory had passed. By closing the case, he had put himself out of a job and was now underemployed and despondent. The fact that Torswats still hadn’t been arrested, jailed, or charged—that Dennis still didn’t even know his real name—made his triumph feel all the more illusory.\nAt loose ends, Dennis began spending nights in his Civic, patrolling the streets of Seattle’s worst neighborhoods. He spent hours staring out of its tinted windows at homeless people and sex workers, trying to match their faces with missing persons photos from human trafficking cases, looking for any outlet for his detective skills that might give him a mission—a reason to continue.\nThen, in November 2023, ahead of schedule, Torswats came out of retirement. In a new swatting call, the same deep voice affected a dopey, confessional air and warned dispatchers that a friend was planning a mass shooting that day at North Beach Junior/Senior High School in western Washington. “He showed me them. He showed me the pipe bombs,” the voice intoned, adopting the usual themes as if there’d been no break in his now multiyear swatting campaign. “Afterwards he’s going to come in with his AR-15 and kill everyone.”\nTorswats then targeted a former federal law enforcement agent and swatting expert—a man named Keven Hendricks who had recently been featured in an Economist interview about the relentless surge of swatting attacks. Torswats sent police to Hendricks’ home and left a voicemail for Hendricks himself. “Hello. I just swatted you and your parents,” he said. “That’s what you deserve for being a filthy fed.” He posted a photo of Hendricks on his public Telegram channel, his eyes blacked out and his address scrawled across the image.\nOn Telegram, Dennis could see that Torswats had reemerged. But the private eye had run out of outrage. He felt numb. He could no longer muster the energy to track Torswats’ online boasting, to even feel angry at the FBI that it was allowing the swattings to continue. He was done.\nTorswats, meanwhile, seemed to still believe he was untouchable. In December, he posted what he called The List, a kind of illustrated catalog of swatting targets—along with pictures of their homes and addresses. It included political leaders such as US senator Chuck Schumer, Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, and several judges, public health officials including Anthony Fauci, leaders of civil rights and anti-hate groups, and tech CEOs like Tim Cook and Evan Spiegel.\nThen, between Christmas Eve and New Year’s, came a new deluge of swattings. They hit close to a hundred politicians and law enforcement officials in a brazen, coordinated campaign: US Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly, Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Republican senator Rick Scott of Florida. One of the hoax calls, court documents would later state, caused a car accident that resulted in serious injuries.\nBut this time, the voice on the calls wasn’t Torswats. Instead, according to US prosecutors, he orchestrated the operation, providing the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the targets to a 21-year-old and a 26-year-old from Serbia and Romania who allegedly organized and carried out the swatting scheme with lines Torswats fed to them.\nIt was a familiar script. “I shot my wife in the head with my AR-15,” a man identifying himself as “James” said in one such call, targeting the home of Georgia state senator John Albers. He told dispatchers that he had caught his wife sleeping with another man and, after killing her, had taken the man hostage. “I’ll release him for $10,000 in cash,” he added, threatening to detonate pipe bombs and blow up the house if his demands weren’t met.\nFinally, Phillips called Dennis and told him that the FBI had a plan to arrest Torswats. And they needed Dennis’ help.\nAccording to the plan, the bureau would ask its teen suspect’s father to come in to a local police station to retrieve the computers they’d seized. While the father was there, Phillips explained, Dennis should use his old aggrieved ex-husband persona and start another Telegram conversation with Torswats about swatting his ex-wife. Then he should stall for as long as possible to keep Torswats at his computer, logged in to his accounts—so police could burst in and arrest him. Dennis, despite being sick with Covid, agreed.\nInstead, to his and the FBI’s surprise, Torswats accompanied his father to the police station to pick up his devices. The cops quietly arrested him on the spot. As his nemesis was finally taken into custody, Dennis was too ill to celebrate.\nThe FBI and Justice Department both declined WIRED’s request for comment, which included questions about why the FBI had taken so many months after learning Torswats’ name—even after searching his house—to arrest him.\nNearly two years into his investigation, Dennis finally learned the teen’s name: Alan Filion. He saw photos of Filion for the first time and mentally replaced the image of Dshocker’s face with that of the actual alleged swatter teen he’d been hunting. Like Dshocker, Filion was big. He had long, lank brown hair. In photos, he wore a wide-eyed, innocent expression.\nAt the time of his arrest, Filion was 17 years old. When Dennis’ case had begun, Filion had been only 15.\nFilion fits the profile of plenty of online delinquents. He, like Dennis, appeared to have grown up online, finding community in niche forums more than the physical world. His high school years were defined by the isolation of pandemic lockdowns. According to Lancaster’s Antelope Valley community college, Filion started pursuing a degree in mathematics in the fall of 2022 after graduating from high school early. But a professor at Antelope Valley could hardly remember him at all. One person who knew him says he was quiet and “forgettable,” with few friends.\nA person claiming to be Filion’s friend alleges he was part of a group aiming to incite racial violence and that he sought money to “buy weapons and commit a mass shooting.” An anonymous tip, submitted to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center and obtained by WIRED, alleged that the individual behind the Torswats account was involved in a neo-Nazi cult known as the Order of Nine Angles. The tipster claimed he believed Torswats’ actions were contributing to the “end of days” by “bleeding the finances and man-hours of the system.”\nIn a May interview with WIRED, Torswats admitted that he made his hoax calls partly for fame and partly for political reasons. “It’s taking money that would normally be used for welfare checks to Jews and to bankers and to oligarchs,” he said in his drawl, “and it’s being spent on searching schools.”\nDennis, for his part, has settled on a simpler theory to explain Torswats’ behavior—and the entire scourge of swatting as a means to blindly terrorize strangers. He defaults to the same principle he used to explain why Dshocker swatted him nearly two decades earlier.\n“Power,” Dennis says. “Because they can.”\nIn November, just weeks after his 18th birthday, Filion pleaded guilty to charges stemming from his nationwide spree of swatting calls. He faces up to 20 years in prison for four counts of making interstate threats to injure another person. As of mid-December, the teenager is awaiting sentencing in a Seminole County, Florida, jail cell.\nDennis remains in a different form of purgatory. On a recent night, when a WIRED reporter visited him, he went through his usual routine: he ate breakfast, checked his email for leads on work, played the video game Rocket League, and idled aimlessly around his apartment. Throughout the evening, he carried a loaded glock in a holster, a round in the chamber, no safety. He drinks Red Bulls every two hours, exactly, now timed with alarms on his phone, to space out his caffeine intake. He no longer gets visits from the squirrels. He can’t be sure, but he believes that his favorites—Jackie, Jesse, Alvin, Doug—have died of old age or been killed by other animals. Dennis doesn’t have it in him to befriend new ones.\nOn one of his nighttime drives through Seattle’s skid rows, he recently spotted an 11-year-old girl near a Krispy Kreme. He recognized her from a poster of missing and exploited children. She approached his car thinking he might be a customer; he then helped local police to find her and reconnect her with a foster family. He’s proud of that, just as he’s proud of having cracked the Torswats case. But he has received little recognition for either, from police agencies or the FBI. His paid work as a private eye has largely evaporated. To stay afloat, he has sold off possessions—including the very computer he used to find Torswats—and for a time took up driving for Uber Eats. “It’s been the worst year I’ve had in a long time,” he says.\nIn the meantime, Dennis has watched in dismay as swattings—and school swattings in particular—have continued to spread across the US. There’s been no new Torswats, no single, prominent villain who single-handedly represents the threat. But nor has there been a shortage of new nihilist trolls willing to pick up where Torswats left off.\nDennis has no faith any of that will change. The US remains a country awash in guns, where the prospect of a mass shooting has become a pervasive, looming menace. And American police remain a hair-trigger, militarized force ready to be exploited by anyone with modest technical skills and a convincing voice.\nIf Dennis is hopeful about anything, it’s that another high-profile case will come his way, one that will give him the same sense of purpose he felt during the Torswats investigation. As he drives around in the dark, he seems to hope that another monster will appear for him to hunt—that it might offer him a chance to repair his career and some part of the world.\n“Things will happen that will change the course of your life,” he says from the driver’s seat of his Honda as he peers out of the windshield at the North Seattle streets. “Things will reveal themselves.”\nLet us know what you think about this article.

    "content_text": "CES 2025 Live Blog: News, Photos, and Videos From Tech's Big Show\nGet live reports and photos of all the products, trends, and quirky gadgets we're seeing this week at CES in Las Vegas.\nEvery January, CES takes over Las Vegas. The giant trade show is a global bazaar where the best and worst tech products for the coming year are trotted out for the press, retailers and resellers, and other attendees. The products on display are things you can wear, ride, listen to, stare at, climb inside, hold in your hand, and even put in your mouth. CES is also a car show, with most of the major automakers displaying their prototypes and concepts alongside their production vehicles.\nHere on this page, we'll be keeping a running report of everything we find interesting, from new driver assistance tech to bio-scanning devices to the latest smart home innovations.\nLive coverage kicks off each day around 8 am Las Vegas time—that's 11 am on the East Coast, 4 pm in the UK—and will pause at the end of each day. We'll be here all week, so check back often.\nThat's a Wrap on Our CES 2025 Live Blog\nWell folks, it's been real. But even though our live updates are winding down for the week, the WIRED crew is still here in Las Vegas, and we're still getting product demos and writing up the most important news. Those stories will live on WIRED's CES landing page, so we encourage you to check Thursday and Friday to see the rest of our event coverage.\nMeantime, here are all the stories from CES 2025—just in case you missed any!\nPhoto Gallery Day One: 10 of the Coolest Things We’ve Seen\nPhoto Gallery Day Two: 10 More of the Coolest Things We’ve Seen\nPhoto Gallery Day Three: 11 More of the Most Fun Things We’ve Seen\nYour Next AI Wearable Will Listen to Everything All the Time\nThe Essential CPU and GPU Field Guide for 2025\nThe Health Monitoring Boom Only Gets Weirder From Here\nLenovo’s Latest Laptop Has a Rollable OLED Screen\nNvidia’s $3,000 ‘Personal AI Supercomputer’\nRobot Vacuums Are Now the Tiny Butlers of Your Dreams\nPebble Flow EV Travel Trailer: Glamping Goes Electric\nLG’s Beautiful Projector Is Also a Speaker and a Mood Lamp\nMulti-use products are scattered all over the LG booth this year—scroll down to see the wine fridge with a speaker built in—but most of those gadgets on display are just prototypes that may never go on sale. The PF600U projector, however, is one prototype you will actually be able to buy in the next 12 months.\nDoubling up as a Bluetooth speaker and color-changing mood lamp, the PF600U isn’t going to bowl over cinephiles with its 1920x1080 resolution, basic HDR support, and 300 ANSI lumens of brightness. But if those topics form the crux of your dinner conversation (hi, it’s me), it probably isn’t aimed at you anyway.\nInspired by a floor lamp, the PF600U packs in stereo speakers, can project nine different colors onto the wall at five brightness levels, and has a 110-degree tilting head that lets it easily switch between lamp mode and projector mode.\nThe hybrid was being shown off next to LG’s more performance-focused CineBeam S, LG’s newest and smallest 4K Ultra Short Throw projector, capable of projecting images ranging from 40- to 100-inches with just a few inches of wall clearance\nWe’re still waiting on pricing for both, but LG confirmed availability for 2025.\nThis PC Tracks Your Face and Blasts Audio Directly at You\nThe tech, called Focused Sound, is built into a new Lenovo computer. It enables semi-private listening without headphones. See it in action and read Julian's full story about Lenovo's CES 2025 releases.\nKeychron Will Have Ceramic Keyboards This Year\nKeychron makes our favorite mechanical keyboards, but the company believes Hall Effect keyboards are the future, which is why two of its brand-new keyboards available now have HE switches. (We have a handy explainer on Hall Effect sensors right here.) The new keyboards are the Q6 HE QMK and Lemokey P1 HE—the latter is from the company’s gaming sub-brand. I also got to see two other upcoming HE keyboards, but there was something more exciting I got a glimpse of: a ceramic keyboard.\nOK, technically this was just a dummy unit to show off what a ceramic keyboard—keys and base—would feel like, but it sure is luxe and beautifully smooth. Keychon chief operating officer Paul Tan says the company will be making ceramic keyboards in 2025, though these will be pricier and maybe more limited edition boards. Ceramic keys aren’t new—a company called CeraKeys makes ceramic keycaps—but they’re hardly mainstream, and Keychron could have the potential to make them more commonplace.\nLG’s Wine Fridge Party Speaker Leads a Line of Crazy Mashups\nWhy have one product when you can cram several, quite niche products into one? That certainly seems to be LG’s approach for the slew of new concept products it showed off at CES 2025. All concepts have to be a little bit nuts, right?\nOne that really couldn’t be missed, not least because of the terrifying stuffed cats LG had placed on it, was the AeroCatTower, a cat bed and air purifier that can provide a cosy (and gently heated) bed for your furry friend, while also tracking their weight and sleep habits in the LG ThinkQ app, and of course purifying the air.\nIt was shown off alongside LG’s new concept plant pot lamp, which provides a large and stylish plant growing space with a brightness-adjustable light. There’s a 1.5-gallon capacity water tank for keeping your plants appropriately hydrated, with the lamp on hand to support optimal plant growth—as well as set the ambiance in your home.\nThese were great and all, but my eye was particularly drawn to the High Up wine and snack fridge. It offers space for 23 bottles of wine, chilled to the perfect temperature, and magnetic moveable trays and clips for storing all your favorite snacks. Its real party trick, though? The huge speaker that is installed into its top panel. The perfect house party accessory. Push this one into production quickly please, LG.\nRazer’s Project Ava Wants to Be Your In-Game AI Assistant\nRemember flipping through Nintendo Power magazines? Remember rummaging through strategy guides and walkthroughs? Razer’s Project Ava might make that firmly a thing of the past. The company unveiled an AI-based assistant that is accessible when you’re playing a game on your desktop. Stuck somewhere? No need to Alt-Tab and leave the game. Just ask the assistant and it will comb through the internet to give you the answers, stealing the hard work of gaming writers who have painstakingly put together these guides on their own time. The company also says it has plans to provide Ava to game developers so they can bake in tips, strategy recommendations, and walkthroughs themselves, but at a certain point, it feels like a bit of the magic is lost.\nAva can do more than just tell you where the hidden loot is—it can suggest improvements to your gameplay (git gud), recommend things to buy in multiplayer battle online arena games (MOBA), and even suggest what skills to buy. It’s still early days, so there’s not much info on when Razer plans to deploy Ava.\nRobot Vacuums Can Pick Things Up Off Your Floor Now\nRead Adrienne's full report on the Roborock vacuum with an articulated arm, as well as all the other new capabilities coming to robovacs this year.\nTCL’s Ai Me Is an Adorable Concept Companion Robot\nWe have been spoiled with cute robots at CES 2025, but I think TCL’s Ai Me concept companion robot could well be the cutest. I caught a demo at the TCL stand and watched Ai Me roll around the stage, speaking in an only slightly creepy child-like voice and with the most adorable eyes that I swear looked deep into my soul when we briefly came face to face.\nTCL showed how Ai Me would be able to do everything, from control your smart home devices and provide home safety surveillance to capture those wholesome family moments with all of you in the pictures as well as entertain your kids. Ai Me has quite the wardrobe, I’ll have you know.\nAi Me is very much a concept at the moment with no release date. I suspect that might remain the case, but count me in for a real-life working demo if I’m wrong.\nUltrahuman Wants Your Smart Jewelry to Be Real Jewelry\nThere was a crowd around Ultrahuman’s booth in anticipation of the launch of the Ultrahuman Rare, the first luxury version of the smart ring that we call the best smart ring without a subscription.\nUltrahuman’s chief business officer, Bhuvan Srinivasan, expressed some doubts himself about whether smart rings need to look fancy. “After all, we’re a tech company, not a luxury company,” he said. Still, you wear your smart ring almost every day. It should be something that you can wear with your nicest outfits and still feel good about yourself.\nRare comes in three different versions: Desert Rose, made from 18K rose gold; Dune, made from 18K gold; and Desert Snow, which is made from PT950 platinum. Srinivasan alluded to the technical challenges inherent in making a durable smart ring from a much softer material. But even made from a pricier metal, the Rare still has all of the original Ultrahuman ring’s functionality, complete with photoplethysmography sensors and 6-axis motion sensors. I myself don’t often wear my wedding ring; it looks like a mistake, sitting next to the awkward smart rings that I’m always testing on my left hand. But for special occasions, it might be nice to swap it out without getting a gap in the data. If you have to wear it all the time, it might as well look really good. As befits a luxury item, the Rare is currently only available at Selfridges London and Printemps Paris.\nL’Oreal’s Cell BioPrint Uses Your Biology to Better Understand Your Skin\nL’Oreal has been a mainstay at CES for over a decade, launching several products at the show in that time. This year it has unveiled the L’Oreal Cell BioPrint, a tabletop hardware device that provides personalized skin analysis in five minutes, based on advanced proteomics.\nIf you’re wondering what proteomics are, you are me from a couple of hours ago. I now know, however, this is the study of how protein composition in the human body can affect skin aging.\nL’Oreal has determined that there are a number of different proteins in the skin that can dish the dirt on how your skin is doing in key areas—but also how predisposed you are to having these skin concerns, as well as products that may or may not be able to help, based on your biology.\nThe process requires you to pass two sticky pads across clean skin to grab some surface dead skin cells, which are then placed into a buffering solution. A few drops of that solution is loaded into a BioPrint carriage and placed into the machine for processing. In five minutes you’ll have a terrifyingly accurate rundown of your skin, including your skin’s biological age, and ingredient responsiveness.\nIt’s initially aimed for use in stores and dermatology offices, with the hope it’ll become an at-home service in the future. It will launch in Asia at the end of 2025.\nHere Come All the Smart Glasses\nIf I tried to find every single smart glasses company at CES, I’d probably be here all week. Walk into Central Hall at the LVCC and you’re greeted to three to four smart eyewear brands, some new, some old. These kinds of gadgets have showed up in many forms over the years ever since the original Google Glass and North’s Focals, but it’s Meta’s Ray-Ban Wayfarers that really helped explode popularity. Google also recently announced the Android XR platform, which means even more smart glasses are probably on the way. Let’s run through a handful of the ones I did manage to see:\nSightful Spacetop Glasses: I’ve been following the development of the Spacetop for some time now, but the company is finally shipping its product as of the first day of CES 2025. And boy is it different. The original design was the bottom half of a laptop attached to a pair of smart glasses. Now? It’s just the smart glasses (which are technically not even made by Sightful—they’re Xreal glasses). Sightful is focused on the software, an augmented reality spatial computing platform that lets you work in a virtual environment and place apps all around you, but apparently the previous version just didn’t have enough compute power to enable all of this well enough. That’s why now you need to bring your own Intel Lunar Lake or Meteor Lake-powered laptop—plug the glasses into the machine and you’ll have a bigger world to work in. Broader hardware support is on the horizon. The cost is steep. The glasses and a 1-year subscription to the software start at $950—it’s unclear how much the software will cost after that.\nNuance Audio Frames: A new sub-brand from EssilorLuxottica, Nuance Audio first showed off a prototype pair of smart glasses that can boost hearing at CES 2024, but now the product is close to its final form and will be available in 2025 over the counter for $1,100. There are speakers baked into the arms of the glasses, and microphones situated at the front. It uses beam-forming mics to isolate audio and fixes in on the person or subject in front of you, feeding their voice through the speakers so you can hear them better. It’s designed for people with low to moderate hearing loss, and is still pending FDA approval. My demo wasn’t great—it was a loud environment and the person’s voice wasn’t consistently coming through the speakers, but I’ll chalk it up to it being a prototype.\nLoomos AI Glasses: Accessory maker Sharge now has AI glasses. Similar to Meta’s Wayfarer glasses, there’s a 16-megapixel camera to capture 4K photos, 1080p video, and speakers to pump out some tunes. Naturally, there’s built-in access to a voice assistant powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o large language model. The company claims the battery is the largest in the market at 450 mAh and you can even expand this to 6,500 mAh with a neckband power bank. That makes sense since Sharge primarily makes charging and battery accessories. Not sure if I want to wear a battery as a necklace though.\nRayNeo X3 Pro, Air 3, and V3: RayNeo has been making smart glasses for some time now and it has three new glasses at CES. I tried the top-end model—the X3 Pro—and it has projectors in the frame of the glasses that turn the lens into a mini display. I stood there as the person in front of me spoke Chinese and the glasses translated it in real time for me. It wasn’t super accurate, though it was a really loud environment. What’s more surprising is just how lightweight and slim these glasses feel. The technology is evolving rapidly from chunky frames to something more subtle.\nMustard Glasses: Here’s yet another pair of glasses that has the whole shebang—microphones, cameras for taking photo and videos, speakers, and even an AI assistant. Uniquely, there’s a physical cover that blocks the camera when you’re not using it, which might make some users—or the folks around them—feel more comfortable. The AI will be able to analyze what you’re looking at, and Mustard says it will have an app ecosystem. It’s not exactly clear what that will look like though. It launches as a Kickstarter in March.\nThere’s plenty more I didn’t get to see, like the Inair Pro, Xreal One Pro AR, and that’s not even mentioning the ones we’ve already written about, like the Halliday Glasses, Solos AirGo 3, and the Even Realities G1. Pretty soon, we’re all gonna be glassholes!\nSomeday Your Clothes Will Be Your Fitness Tracker\n“Every material will become intelligent at some point or another,” says Myant CEO Tony Chahine. “Clothes will become fully functionalized. I have no doubt that this is going to happen.”\nMyant is a Canadian full-stack medical device company that specializes in advanced materials—that is to say, textiles. I stopped by the company's booth to see two items in particular: Myant's Skiin cardiac monitoring smart garments and its Skiin Active Electroosmotic membrane jacket. Skiin is Myant’s cardiac monitoring system that’s woven into the fabric of the chest strap or arm band. It tracks a truly baffling array of metrics, including ECG, cuffless blood pressure, breathing pattern and volume, core body temperature, oxygen saturation (SpO2), actigraphy and posture, and sleep metrics to check for sleep apnea.\nWhile you can do point checks of an ECG by running a test on your watch, a garment that you wear constantly is far more likely to accurately assess your risk. Up to 5 percent of the population have arrhythmias, according to the Cleveland Clinic. But the majority of them go undiagnosed because they don’t have any symptoms. Continuous, passive monitoring would spot those risks—especially for women, whose symptoms are more often overlooked than men.\nMyant had a wide array of smart textiles on display, including smart underwear that heats up to help ease menstrual cramps, and comfortable smart sheets to check to make sure that your baby is breathing. However, since I am one of WIRED's testers of rain jackets, the Osmotek self-drying jacket was particularly intriguing. The jacket wearer will be able to manipulate the flow of liquids through the jacket by manipulating electrical current.\nWhile this can move water outside of the jacket, Chahine noted that you can also convey liquids in, for example if you wanted to move medicine to a wound site but have the wound remain covered. It makes Lycra look almost boring.\nTP-Link’s Tapo Smart Home Ecosystem Grows Ever Larger\nThe maker of some of our favorite security cameras and routers is being investigated by the US authorities right now, but that didn’t stop it from announcing several new smart home devices at CES. The Tapo HybridCam Duo (C675 KIT) is a versatile dual-lens security camera that combines a fixed wide-angle short-range lens and a longer-range lens that pans and tilts. There’s also a Tapo NVR Security System for folks who want a local wired system of cameras. TP-Link also showed the Tapo PalmKey Smart Door Lock, which uses the veins in your palms instead of fingerprints.\nBeyond security, there was the Tapo Atom-Link Lighting System with a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Mesh designed to ensure its new smart bulbs, smart downlights, and smart switches are responsive even if Wi-Fi is weak where they are installed. The Tapo RV70 Pro Ultra is its latest robot vacuum with a water production and purification system that extracts moisture from the air and recycles dirty water after mopping for the next cleaning cycle. And of course, the obligatory Tapo AI Assistant, which promises to anticipate your needs, connect devices, and automate your smart home.\nFinally, there were a few Wi-Fi 7 routers, including a travel model and an outdoor router, but you may want to hang fire on those until the US government decides whether to ban TP-Link routers.\nThe Dolby Atmos System in Cadillac’s EV Thumps—Spatially\nDolby Atmos Music, which brings Dolby’s 360-degree sound format to artists old and new, has in many ways seen impressive adoption. It’s been leveraged by tons of top artists, from Elton John to Post Malone, including over 90 percent of 2024’s Billboard’s top 100. It's inspired speakers like the excellent Sonos Era 300, and according to Dolby, the audio type is supported by 20-plus music services worldwide. Still, when it comes to how most people listen, it hasn’t yet made much of a dent in good old stereo. Maybe that’s because it hasn’t found the right venue yet.\nCadillac thinks that venue could be the cockpit of your car. After what I just heard, I’m inclined to agree. Using 19 different AKG speakers meticulously tuned for 7.1.4 sound, the company’s new Optiq electric car just punched me in the feels with one of the best interpretations of Dolby’s new(ish) format that I’ve experienced yet.\nWhile 3D music mixes can sometimes feel a little cacophonous or drowned in an echoey haze, that was definitely not the case in the demo I heard. Jacob Collier’s “Witness Me” was particularly hair-raising, with crisp clarity at the center and a barrage of voices expanding throughout the cabin. Other vehicles have begun to adopt some form of the technology, as well, making me an increasing believer in the format’s merits. Now, if I can just raise the scratch to get one for myself.\nSamsung Loves a Matte TV Screen\nIf there’s a common theme for Samsung’s core TVs in 2025 it’s that the matte is back in a big way. By putting a matte finish on a typically glassy television screen can cut down glare and make the TV easier to view in brighter environments.\nSamsung first introduced a version of its matte-like screen in The Frame TV, which has become extremely popular for its design that looks like a painting on your wall. This year, Samsung added a step-up model in the Frame Pro with significant performance enhancements.\nBut that’s not the only TV using the brand’s glare-resistant backdrop. As with last year’s S95D OLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends), the new S95F continues to use the reflection stopping display design, while the technology has expanded to its new Q990F and Q900F 8K TVs as well as the stalwart Q90 series TV in the new Q90F 4K mini LED TV. For those tired of running cables through the wall, Samsung’s new Wireless One Connect box serves up more innovation, offered with the Frame Pro (naturally) and the ultra-thin Q990F. Similar to LG’s M-series TVs, the Wireless One Connect provides cable-free transmission to the new screens from a claimed 10 meters.\nAcer’s New Flagship Gaming Handheld Is a Monster\nAcer has announced not one, but two new Nitro Blaze gaming handhelds at CES 2025, the Nitro Blaze 8 and the Nitro Blaze 11. Of the two, it was the latter that really grabbed our attention, because—well—it’s enormous.\nFeaturing a huge 10.95-inch 144Hz WQXGA touch display that offers up to 500 nits of brightness, it’s like gaming on the go with an iPad Air—except it feels even larger thanks to the detachable Hall Effect joysticks on either side.\nThe Nitro Blaze 8 is a little more sensibly sized, with an 8.8-inch screen and built-in joysticks that can’t be removed.\nBoth feature AMD’s Ryzen 8040HS processor, 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and up to 2TB or storage. They join the Nitro Blaze 7 that was announced at IFA 2024, and will be available by the summer for $899 and $1,099 respectively.\nSony’s Going to Pump Out More Awesome Anime\nEven though it’s a gigantic PITA, I always try to catch the Sony press conference, which is typically one of the latest pressers to happen at CES. I hate to add to the Sony hype, but pretty much every intellectual property pie that the company puts its fingers in (I’m sorry I can’t come up with a better, less disgusting analogy) is very exciting and well done. I love The Last of Us. I love Horizon Zero Dawn. I have never lost hope that one day Troy Baker will be one of the guest speakers and I’ll get to hear Joel Miller’s voice in person.\nThere was a dearth of News News. The company finally opened the waitlist to buy an Afeela for $90,000, though I’m not sure why you’d want to. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was also on hand to announce that Sony is making a new football coach headset. But most of the presentation revolved around Sony’s creator tools and its partnerships with Crunchyroll and Aniplex, anime-focused entertainment services.\nThe popular Demon Slayer series is going to become a movie! Ghost of Tsushima will be an anime! Until Dawn, the movie based on the the wildly popular horror video game, will probably debut this year! I was also incredibly excited when Peter Stormare (aka the best part of Fargo) was announced to be a speaker, but alas, he was only a pre-filmed video clip. Recycle everything back and forth forever! It’s very easy to please a fan.\nTCL’s Tablet and Android Phones Have Epaper-Like Displays\nEveryone went crazy over the Boox Palma last year, a phone-sized e-reader powered by Android. Well, TCL might have something better: an Android phone and an Android tablet with screens that transition from color to an epaper-like experience. They employ the company’s Nxtpaper technology, which TCL has been iterating on for several years and has now reached its fourth generation. This matte screen reduces the amount of blue light that reaches your eyes and cuts down glare.\nThe TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper actually uses the third generation of the technology but TCL is finally bringing it to the US on the open market as an unlocked device (some Nxtpaper Android phones have been available but only at select carriers). This phone has a slider key that can switch the display from a matte color screen to Max Ink Mode, which mimics the E Ink experience on an e-reader. It silences notifications, and the battery will last for around 7 days if you use it for reading (it has a standby time of 26 days). However, since you can technically use apps like YouTube in this mode, that battery life will vary. TCL is also partnering with Microsoft to integrate its Copilot AI assistant into the operating system level. It’s a respectable device considering the expected sub-$300 price, with a 120-Hz screen, 256 GB of storage, and a 50-MP rear camera.\nThe TCL Nxtpaper 11 Plus is the first to use the fourth-gen Nxtpaper tech, which supposedly offers better clarity and sharpness, is more color-accurate, and better matches ambient lighting conditions. This one has a button that, when held, can let you switch between three modes. The first is the regular color screen, then there’s an e-paper like screen that has some color, and the third is the same Max Ink Mode for the full black and white e-reader experience.\nThere’s no details on pricing and availability for the tablet, but the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper will arrive in Canada this spring with US to follow after, though exact timing and price hasn’t been announced. I asked about the software update policies for these devices, which has long been a point of frustration on TCL devices, and the company said it would share more details at Mobile World Congress in March.\nAqara’s Video Doorbell Is Also a Smart Home Hub\nSmart home gadget manufacturer Aqara has unveiled a wave of new sensors, switches, and a new control panel to make your home smarter, but what jumps out to us is the Doorbell Camera Hub G410. It can serve as a smart home hub with dual-band Wi-Fi, Thread and Zigbee support, and the ability to act as a Matter controller.\nThis update to one of our favorite video doorbells, the G4, also brings enhanced 2K video quality with a wider 176-degree field of view, RTSP support, and compatibility with Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. It also looks more compact than its chunky predecessor, but there’s no word on the release date or price just yet.\nNetgear's New Orbi 870 Is the ‘Middle Child’ of Its Mesh Networking Line\nAfter the egregiously over-priced Netgear Orbi 970 Series, we got the much more affordable 770 Series, which earned a place in our best mesh systems guide. The new Orbi 870 Series is the middle child, coming in at $1,300 for a three-pack.\nThis is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 mesh capable of covering up to 9,000 square feet. The main router has one 10 Gbps Ethernet WAN port, but both it and its satellites boast four 2.5 Gbps Ethernet LAN ports apiece. Most folks should still opt for the cheaper 770 Series, as you’ll need multi-gig internet and a large property to make full use of this mesh. Netgear has also revamped its subscription services to offer a new tier called Armor Plus, which adds VPN service, ad-blocking, and anti-tracking to its standard security software but bumps the price up to a whopping $12.49 a month.",

Walk into Central Hall at the LVCC and you’re greeted to three to four smart eyewear brands, some new, some old. These kinds of gadgets have showed up in many forms over the years ever since the original Google Glass and North’s Focals, but it’s Meta’s Ray-Ban Wayfarers that really helped explode popularity. Google also recently announced the Android XR platform, which means <em>even more</em> smart glasses are <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/smart-glasses-all-the-way-down/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">probably on the way</a>. Let’s run through a handful of the ones I did manage to see:</p><p><strong>Sightful Spacetop Glasses:</strong> I’ve been following the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/sightful-spacetop-augmented-reality-laptop-hands-on-news/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">development of the Spacetop</a> for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/sightful-spacetop-g1-augmented-reality-laptop/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">some time now</a>, but the company is finally shipping its product as of the first day of CES 2025. And boy is it different. The original design was the bottom half of a laptop attached to a pair of smart glasses. Now? It’s just the smart glasses (which are technically not even made by Sightful—they’re Xreal glasses). Sightful is focused on the software, an augmented reality spatial computing platform that lets you work in a virtual environment and place apps all around you, but apparently the previous version just didn’t have enough compute power to enable all of this well enough. That’s why now you <em>need</em> to bring your own Intel Lunar Lake or Meteor Lake-powered laptop—plug the glasses into the machine and you’ll have a bigger world to work in. Broader hardware support is on the horizon. The cost is steep. The glasses and a 1-year subscription to the <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://orders.sightful.com/products/spacetop-bundle-by-sightful\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://orders.sightful.com/products/spacetop-bundle-by-sightful\" href=\"https://orders.sightful.com/products/spacetop-bundle-by-sightful\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">software start at $950</a>—it’s unclear how much the software will cost after that.</p><p><strong>Nuance Audio Frames:</strong> A new sub-brand from EssilorLuxottica, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/2023highlights/nuance-audio/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/2023highlights/nuance-audio/\" href=\"https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/2023highlights/nuance-audio/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nuance Audio</a> first showed off a prototype pair of smart glasses that can boost hearing at CES 2024, but now the product is close to its final form and will be available in 2025 over the counter for $1,100. There are speakers baked into the arms of the glasses, and microphones situated at the front. It uses beam-forming mics to isolate audio and fixes in on the person or subject in front of you, feeding their voice through the speakers so you can hear them better. It’s designed for people with low to moderate hearing loss, and is still pending FDA approval. My demo wasn’t great—it was a loud environment and the person’s voice wasn’t consistently coming through the speakers, but I’ll chalk it up to it being a prototype.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>Loomos</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Tristan deBrauwere</span></div></figure><p><strong>Loomos AI Glasses</strong>: Accessory maker Sharge <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://sharge.com/products/loomos-ai-glasses-1/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://sharge.com/products/loomos-ai-glasses-1/\" href=\"https://sharge.com/products/loomos-ai-glasses-1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">now has AI glasses</a>. Similar to Meta’s Wayfarer glasses, there’s a 16-megapixel camera to capture 4K photos, 1080p video, and speakers to pump out some tunes. Naturally, there’s built-in access to a voice assistant powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o large language model. The company claims the battery is the largest in the market at 450 mAh and you can even expand this to 6,500 mAh with a neckband power bank. That makes sense since Sharge primarily makes charging and battery accessories. Not sure if I want to wear a battery as a necklace though.</p><p><strong>RayNeo X3 Pro, Air 3, and V3:</strong> RayNeo has been making smart glasses for some time now and it has three new glasses at CES. I tried the top-end model—the X3 Pro—and it has projectors in the frame of the glasses that turn the lens into a mini display. I stood there as the person in front of me spoke Chinese and the glasses translated it in real time for me. It wasn’t super accurate, though it was a really loud environment. What’s more surprising is just how lightweight and slim these glasses feel. The technology is evolving rapidly from chunky frames to something more subtle.</p><p><strong>Mustard Glasses:</strong> Here’s yet another pair of glasses that has the whole shebang—microphones, cameras for taking photo and videos, speakers, and even an AI assistant. Uniquely, there’s a physical cover that blocks the camera when you’re not using it, which might make some users—or the folks around them—feel more comfortable. The AI will be able to analyze what you’re looking at, and Mustard says it will have an app ecosystem. It’s not exactly clear what that will look like though. It launches as a Kickstarter in March.</p><p>There’s plenty more I didn’t get to see, like the Inair Pro, Xreal One Pro AR, and that’s not even mentioning the ones we’ve already written about, like the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/ces-2025-photo-gallery-day-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Halliday Glasses</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/ces-2025-photo-gallery-day-3/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Solos AirGo 3</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/review-even-realities-g1-smart-glasses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Even Realities G1</a>.

    "content_text": "On Tuesday, Santa Ana winds swept seaward through Southern California, scattering embers and then fanning flames of a growing wildfire. By nighttime, residents received urgent text alerts warning of potential 100 mph gusts—a terrifying escalation that transformed a precarious situation into a full-blown crisis. As the winds howled, more embers took flight, sparking new fires in dry, brittle brushlands that hadn’t seen significant rain in over eight months.\nLos Angeles County, primed by drought-like conditions, was a tinderbox waiting for a spark. Firefighters faced an uphill battle against winds so severe that airplanes used to drop water and flame retardants were grounded. Officials warned in a Wednesday morning press release that “all residents of Los Angeles county are in danger.” Evacuation orders have since displaced tens of thousands of residents, with thousands more awaiting updates. By Wednesday evening, three major fires had consumed over 13,000 acres with containment efforts lagging: The Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades and Malibu, Hurst Fire in Sylmar, and Eaton Fire near Pasadena have showed no signs of slowing down, are at the time of writing 0 percent contained, and have already become the most destructive in California history.\nThe fires turned catastrophic so quickly because of unusually dry and windy conditions: “Any little spark, whether from a lightning strike or a person or a campfire is going to quickly, quickly escalate,” says Jennifer Marlon, research scientist and lecturer at the Yale School of the Environment and the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “Once a fire starts in these conditions, it’s very, very hard to get under control,” adds Kaitlyn Trudeau, senior research associate of climate science at the nonprofit news organization Climate Central.\nSanta Ana winds events aren’t uncommon. “We see it every single year at this time,” says Jason Moreland, senior meteorologist at emergency communications platform AlertMedia. These downhill winds, which originate inland, are caused by a dry high-pressure system coming from the northwest, and a low, humid pressure system from the south. “It’s like if you have a hose and you fold it in half to cut off the water. If you prick a hole in the side, you have a lot of pressure to get out,” explains Trudeau. “That’s basically what’s happening with the air.”\nHowever, these winds are a lot stronger than usual because of a dip in the jet stream near the Baja Peninsula in northwestern Mexico, Moreland explains. Winds that are usually relegated to higher elevations are reaching lower terrain areas. “Every so many decades, we do get wind events of this magnitude,” he says.\nWhile this wind event seems extreme, Noah Diffenbaugh, professor and senior fellow at Stanford’s Woods Institute for the Environment, explained that it might just be due to natural weather variability—and more research is needed to know if it is caused by climate change.\nHowever, while the winds aren’t unseasonal, climate change is increasing the risk of late- or early-season wildfires in California. “This is not only a particularly strong wind event, but is also a particularly dry season here in the beginning of January,” says Diffenbaugh. Southern California’s wet season, which runs from October through April, has seen record low precipitation, following one of the driest falls on record. As precipitation is more variable due to climate change, the overlap between the windy season and the dry season is increasing. “We’re seeing a significant amount of more, hot, dry, windy days, especially in Southern California,” says Trudeau.\nAdding to the problem, the two previous years saw above-normal precipitation, leading to growth of vegetation and foliage in the mountain regions. “That was priming the land, so to speak,” says Moreland. “All that vegetation has now cured and is more flammable, and we’re seeing easier ignitions, more rapid fire spread.” The proximity to people and structures compounds the risks: “The houses intermixed with the vegetation is what’s so problematic because, in this case, the houses are providing a lot of the fuel,” says Marlon.\nPlus, all of these events are occurring against a backdrop of warmer annual temperatures due to climate change. “Just boosting that background temperature a little bit can allow fires to rapidly escalate,” says Marlon.\nDiffenbaugh likens it to a baseball game: Climate change doesn’t have to hit the home run to affect how many runs are scored. “If it puts runners on base, then the impact of the home run is increased,” he explains. In this case, the bases were loaded with dry conditions, warm temperatures, and fuel. The winds were just up to bat.\nWithout rain in sight, many regions are still vulnerable. “Southern California relies on the winter months for their wet season,” says Moreland. “If you don’t get beneficial precipitation during this time of the year, it doesn’t bode well for really the rest of the spring and summer months going into 2025.” Fires are also happening in unexpected places at unusual times: “There are many aspects to the fires that are changing: Their place, their location, their timing, their severity, their size, the whole nature of fire in a warmer climate is different,” says Marlon. “All of this is happening in the context of an incoming president who has called climate change a hoax,” says Marlon. “To me, it’s really alarming that we’re going to have this vacuum in leadership right when we need to be protecting people and preparing the most.”\nAs fires are increasingly common, severe, and unpredictable, better preparation and climate adaptation is crucial to mitigate future disasters. Local organizations and governments are working to protect homes and communities, and advances in fire-resistant building materials, more aggressive fuel management programs, and improved early warning systems can—and already are—making a difference. “We should be keeping this in mind as development expands and continues to encroach into these places that regularly naturally burn,” says Marlon.\nUpdated 1-15-2025 11:10 pm GMT: A misspelling of Noah Diffenbaugh’s name was corrected.",

    "content_text": "Using a series of prompts six days before he died by suicide outside the main entrance of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Matthew Livelsberger, a highly decorated US Army Green Beret from Colorado, consulted with an artificial intelligence on the best ways to turn a rented Cybertruck into a four-ton vehicle-borne explosive. According to documents obtained exclusively by WIRED, US intelligence analysts have been issuing warnings about this precise scenario over the past year—and among their concerns are that AI tools could be used by racially or ideologically motivated extremists to target critical infrastructure, in particular the power grid.\n“We knew that AI was going to change the game at some point or another in, really, all of our lives,” Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told reporters on Tuesday. “Absolutely, it’s a concerning moment for us.”\nCopies of his exchanges with OpenAI’s ChatGPT show that Livelsberger, 37, pursued information on how to amass as much explosive material as he legally could while en route to Las Vegas, as well as how best to set it off using the Desert Eagle gun discovered in the Cybertruck following his death. Screenshots shared by McMahill's office reveal Livelsberger prompting ChatGPT for information on Tannerite, a reactive compound typically used for target practice. In one such prompt, Livelsberger asks, “How much Tannerite is equivalent to 1 pound of TNT?\" He follows up by asking how it might be ignited at “point blank range.”\nThe documents obtained by WIRED show that concerns about the threat of AI being used to help commit serious crimes, including terrorism, have been circulating among US law enforcement. They reveal that the Department of Homeland Security has persistently issued warnings about domestic extremists who are relying on the technology to “generate bomb making instructions” and develop “general tactics for conducting attacks against the United States.”\nThe memos, which are not classified but are restricted to government personnel, state that violent extremists are increasingly turning to tools like ChatGPT to help stage attacks aimed at collapsing American society through acts of domestic terror.\nAccording to notes investigators found on his phone, Livelsberger intended the bombing as a “wake-up call” to Americans, whom he urged to reject diversity, embrace masculinity, and rally around president-elect Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He also urged Americans to purge Democrats from the federal government and the military, calling for a “hard reset.”\nWhile McMahill contended Tuesday that the incident in Las Vegas may be the first “on US soil where ChatGPT was utilized to help an individual build a particular device,” federal intelligence analysts say extremists associated with white supremacist and accelerationist movements online are now frequently sharing access to hacked versions of AI chatbots in an effort to construct bombs with an eye to carrying out attacks against law enforcement, government facilities, and critical infrastructure.\nIn particular, the memos highlight the vulnerability of the US power grid, a popular target among extremists populating “Terrorgram,” a loose network of encrypted chatrooms that host a range of violent, racially-motivated individuals bent on the destruction of American democratic institutions. The documents, shared exclusively with WIRED, were first obtained by Property of the People, a nonprofit focused on national security and government transparency.\nThe Department of Homeland Security declined an opportunity to comment. Liz Bourgeois, a spokesperson for OpenAI, said the company is “saddened by the incident in Las Vegas and is committed to seeing AI tools used responsibly.”\n“Our models are designed to refuse harmful instructions and minimize harmful content. In this case, ChatGPT responded with information already publicly available on the internet and provided warnings against harmful or illegal activities,” the spokesperson said, adding that the company is continuing to work with law enforcement to support the investigation.\nWhile ChatGPT and other similar tools are, to varying degrees, proficient at synthesizing information, most draw almost exclusively from source material obtainable in other ways, including via search engines like Google. Officials nonetheless fear that the tools’ unique capabilities could at the least make it easier to plan attacks.\nIn October, a regional intelligence office that works with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies issued a security bulletin alerting police that artificial intelligence was being adopted by extremists to query “tactics and targeting” information. In one example provided by an intelligence analyst, a user is shown requesting details on “the most effective physical attack against the power grid.” The chatbot quickly returns paragraphs of information—suggestions, the analysts’ notes say, on which methods are “more effective than others.”\nThe chatbot generated language providing advice on which areas of the power grid are deemed most “critical” and offered suggestions on which components to attack based on the “significant time” it would take to effect repairs. Certain components would likely “take months to replace,” according to the bot. (WIRED is purposely refraining from replicating the instructions here.)\nWhile there are ways to “trick” popular AI tools into generating malicious instructions, analysts say, other, “lesser-known” tools, such as chatbots that lack the traditional safeguards of their American-made cousins, are also growing in popularity.\nA counterterrorism memo reviewed by WIRED, circulated last year by law enforcement in Ohio, warns that malicious actors have been highly successful in “jailbreaking” common AI tools. “These jailbreaks, in addition to chatbot account credentials, are currently being sold and shared on online forums such as Telegram, making it easier for a wider range of actors to access them.” The analysts identified several popular security exploits known as prompt injections. Well-known ones have included the DAN (“Do Anything Now”) prompt, which was made available free on GitHub, “along with others such as the Evil-Bot and STAN (‘Strive to Avoid Norms’) prompt.”\n“Each of these prompts use a tactic known as the ‘role play’ training model, where users ask the chatbot to answer questions as if it were another chatbot—one without ChatGPT’s ethical restrictions,” the memo says. The memo also highlights use of the “Skeleton Key,” a new form of jailbreak reported by Microsoft last spring.\nAnother memo to police issued by intelligence analysts at the Department of Homeland Security similarly stated that violent extremists in the US have employed prompt injections to disable safeguards installed into popular AI tools such as ChatGPT. The analysts warned last spring that bootleg AI products have been deployed to “generate bomb making instructions” and provide “information on targeting electrical substations,” which is a common occurrence.\n“An assault on the energy sector has as always been front and center on the mind of domestic terrorists. It is their main attack focus; they view it as a direct pathway to fomenting their twisted dream of a civil war,” says Seamus Hughes, a research researcher at NCITE, an academic hub focused on counterterrorism and technology at the University of Nebraska Omaha.\n“We’ve also seen the use of AI as a key tool to lowering the bar for entry into an attack,” Hughes says, “be it helping with plot planning, kicking around ideas for violent actions without triggering law enforcement scrutiny, and helping them enhance their propaganda output.”\n“Terrorgram’s ongoing and aggressive encouragement of violent accelerationist acts is growing more frightening,” adds Wendy Via, cofounder and president of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “The landscape for potential political violence in 2025 will be volatile.\"\nIn May, a 36-year-old woman associated with a neo-Nazi group pleaded guilty to plotting attacks on electric substations in the Baltimore area, which authorities described in a criminal complaint as “racially or ethnically motivated.” A wave of attacks against electrical substations in Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington State in late 2022 reportedly resulted in tens of thousands of people losing power. In 2016, an attack in Utah resulted in a blackout that affected roughly 13,000 households. The attacker reportedly used a high-powered rifle in the attack, firing at range toward an electrical substation. According to the FBI, some Terrorgram manuals also encourage attackers to deploy mylar balloons to ferry explosives or disrupt power lines.\n“The threat is overwhelmingly coming from the far right,” says Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People. “Yet Donald Trump is already spinning falsehoods to shift the blame to immigrants and progressives. As we have seen on countless occasions, Trump’s assaults on the truth provide cover for his and his followers’ assaults on democracy.”\nAnother series of internal security bulletins obtained by Shapiro’s organization show growing concern among US intelligence analysts focused on domestic threats, including the continued spread of publications authored by the Terrorgram collective—manuals that instruct users to become “suicidal lone wolves,” “launch rockets at the Capitol building,” and target “power substations, communications towers, and other vital infrastructure.”\nUsers who carry out these attacks and perish in the process are promised “sainthood” and are offered a place on a coveted “leaderboard,” a list of known terrorists arranged in order by the number of murders they commit. Figures on the leaderboard include Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, and Dylann Roof, a neo-Nazi convicted of the 2015 Charleston church shooting.\n“The Terrorgram collective remains fixated on critical infrastructure attacks, increasingly viewing them as efficient mechanisms through which to collapse the system,\" says Jonathan Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism. “The promotion of such attacks in their digital propaganda and within their online ecosystems continues to inspire lone-actor plots against critical infrastructure.”\nMost attacks on substations go unsolved due to poor surveillance coverage, the remoteness of the equipment, and the ability to attack them at range. There is no federal regulation mandating physical security at these installations, and most states also lack a cohesive protective strategy.\nIn a security bulletin obtained by WIRED from September, the FBI pressed energy-sector companies to upgrade and increase surveillance coverage of substations, pointing to attacks across the Western US. “Absent surveillance video,” the FBI said, “these incidents are difficult to investigate; some substation incidents without surveillance footage have remained unsolved.”\n“While we have no comment on any specific communications, the FBI regularly shares information with our law enforcement partners about potential threats to assist in protecting the communities we serve,” an FBI spokesperson says. “We take all threats seriously and ask members of the public to immediately report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement. Tips can be submitted to the FBI at tips.fbi.gov or 1-800-CALL-FBI.”",

Screenshots shared by McMahill's office reveal Livelsberger prompting ChatGPT for information on Tannerite, a reactive compound typically used for target practice.

    "content_text": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nI spent an entire day of CES wearing a little yellow bracelet. To the unsuspecting nearby humans, it probably looked like a fitness tracker. But the whole time, this yellow Pioneer wearable from Bee AI recorded everything around me. It wasn't storing audio like a typical recorder app, but it processed my conversations, then gave me personalized to-do lists and readable summaries of my in-person chats.\nA few days before the trade show, I spoke with the founder of another new company, Omi, which was officially unveiled for the first time today. Guess what it does? Record everything around you to create an activity log, and then have AI disseminate the information to give you actionable insights and tasks from your day, almost like a personal assistant. Omi's wearable can go around your neck, but it is best worn stuck to your forehead near your temple—it has an electroencephalogram inside, and Omi claims that if you think specifically about talking to the wearable, the device will understand and perk up to receive your request.\nThis is the new world we're in, with artificially intelligent wearables continuously recording the world around us. Voice assistants—which first landed in speakers and on our phones, but quickly moved to our wrists and faces—at least required active engagement like a tap or a wake word to activate their ability to eavesdrop. But the next wave of hardware assistants, which also includes the forthcoming Friend pendant, can absorb information passively and work in the background. They are always listening.\nThe wearable hardware leading this space is often cheap—Bee AI's watch is just $50, and Omi's stick-on bead is $89—but the real magic is in the software, which often requires a subscription as it taps into multiple large language models to analyze your conversations.\nBee AI\nBee AI was founded by Maria de Lourdes Zollo and Ethan Sutin. Both previously worked at Squad (Sutin was the founder), which enabled media screen sharing in video chats so people could remotely watch the same movie or YouTube video together. The company was acquired by X (back when it was called Twitter), and the pair both joined briefly to work on Twitter Spaces. Zollo has previously worked at Tencent and Musical.ly, which subsequently became TikTok.\nSutin says he explored the idea of a personal AI assistant back in 2016 when chatbots were all the rage, but the technology wasn't there yet. That's not the case anymore. The company launched its Bee AI platform last February in beta, with an active community providing feedback. It only just began selling its Pioneer hardware a little more than a week ago. (The “Bee” name plays with the idea of ambient computing, as if something is buzzing around and taking in information.) You don't need the company's hardware to use Bee AI—you can just interact with the AI via the iPhone app—but Zollo says the wearable offers a richer experience as it can record continuously all day. An Android app is on the way at the end of the month.\nThe wearable is simple. It has two microphones for noise isolation, and Sutin says that if you can hear the person you're speaking with in a busy environment, the wearable should be able to hear both parties as well. It can be worn as a band on the wrist or clipped to your shirt. There's an “Action” button in the center; pressing it once mutes the mics, and pressing it again enables them again. You can press and hold the button, and this action is user-configurable, so that can trigger things like processing the current conversation or awakening the “Buzz” AI assistant to ask it a question. (There's no speaker on the wearable, so answers will be spoken out through your phone.) When the mic is muted, there's a red LED. When it's recording, you'd think the green LED would be lit up, but there's nothing to indicate that this wearable is picking up everything around you.\nZollo says having a green LED all the time would impact the purported seven-day battery life of the wearable, but this omission seems like it may make Bee AI fall into a gray area of recording laws, which vary from state to state in the US. While the wearable technically isn't storing audio, you can see a full transcript of conversations, even if it's not completely accurate sometimes. Sutin says everything captured is “treated as maximally sensitive,” and he ensures me the company's business model does not include plans to monetize the collected data, and that nothing will be shared with third parties. He even says no human can see this data.\nThe conversations are not processed locally on the phone; Sutin says the gap is closing for edge processing, but battery life still poses a fundamental problem. So for now, your data is processed in the cloud. Which large language models are deployed by Bee AI depends on the task you want to do. There's a mix of commercial and open source models, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, plus some the company hosts itself.\nSutin says Bee AI's target demographic is people “who talk a lot for a living.” If you're sitting at a desk all day not saying anything to anyone, there's not much for Bee AI's wearable to process unless you start asking it questions. But since it's recording all the time, it can recall things from conversations you have throughout the day. The accuracy of this is a bit hit-or-miss because Bee doesn't necessarily know who the people around you are, but it can discern different speaking voices and arrange the transcripts of the conversations to show different speakers. You can set a name for who the other speakers are. It can also save facts about you. In the same vein, you can ask it to forget things it may have picked up if you don't want them on the record.\nIn the app, you can see a summary of the conversations you've had throughout the day, and at the day's end, it generates a snippet of what the day was like and has the locations of where you had these chats on a map. But the most interesting feature is the middle tab, which is your “To-Dos.” These are automatically generated based on your conversations. I was speaking with my editor and we talked about taking a picture of a product, and lo and behold, Bee AI created a to-do for me to “Remember to take a picture for Mike.” (I must have said his name during the conversation.) You can check these off if you complete them.\nIt's worth pointing out that these to-do's are often not things I need to do. You'll probably end up deleting most of them, but when it does get these tasks accurately, it feels a little magical. Bee AI can be connected to your Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts accounts, so you can ask it to summarize an email or what's next on your calendar, but I didn't have access to try this functionality.\nZollo says Bee AI has a freemium service model, so with just the hardware, you get basic memory recall and summarization features. You'll have to pay $12 per month to access many of the other features, including the integrations with third-party apps, which the company wants to expand.\nOmi\nNikita Shevchenko began his entrepreneurial ventures at 14 when he began mining crypto, and by the age of 18, he sold his first company. His latest project is Omi, a wearable you either wear as a pendant or affix to the side of your forehead using the included medical tape. If you opt for the latter, and don't mind how ridiculous it looks, Shevchenko says if you think about talking specifically to Omi, it will understand and be ready to process your request.\nI haven't tried it, but he claims Omi was trained to recognize the specific brainwaves when you focus on speaking to the wearable, so instead of having to say a hot word, you just think. That interaction is only something you use when you want to engage with the device, though. At every other moment, Omi is essentially a wearable microphone capturing the conversations you have throughout the day, just like Bee AI. With that capability, it can do many of the same things, like transcribe conversations, summarize them, add events to your calendar, and translate.\nEverything is processed on the paired phone and in the cloud, so this is once again not a stand-alone piece of hardware like the Humane Ai Pin. Shevchenko says Omi is open source but is currently trained on ChatGPT. One area where Omi differs from Bee AI is with its marketplace for third-party ideas. There are “apps” built by the community, but think of these more like mods or skills that enhance Omi's integration with everyday apps. For example, there's a Google Drive “app” you can enable to have every conversation summary stored in a Drive folder at the end of the day. These apps can be published to Omi's store, and developers can choose to make it free or paid. There are already dozens of apps, because Shevchenko shipped 5,000 units of an early version of Omi last year to developers.\nHe says eventually, Omi will be able to let users create an AI clone of themselves—one that can talk to followers on their behalf and answer questions. Users can publish these clones for free or as a subscription, earning some side income. This is already somewhat in action through Omi's Personas platform, which lets anyone create an AI clone of a Twitter personality and chat with them.\nUnlike the Bee AI wearable, Omi's wearable always has a light for implied consent that it's capturing and processing conversations around you. Its battery lasts for three days, and like the Bee, it can also leave you tasks to finish based on the context of your chats. Every night, it will send an action plan for the next day. It can even mentor you; imagine leaving a job interview and getting a summary afterward with suggestions on what to do better.\nShevchenko's long-term goal is to have the Omi “read the brain” so it can figure out what you're thinking about. Unlike Neuralink's brain-computer interface, which requires an implant in the brain, Shevchenko wants to accomplish this by continually adding more electrodes to the head. He was able to have the system construct two words with a more complex wearable, so there's still a long way to go.\nThe Omi is available today for $89 and ships in a few weeks.\nHumanPods\nIf you find the utility afforded by an always-listening AI-powered wearable intriguing but you're wary of the possible privacy overstep, just know that not every new AI wearable is taking the “always-on” approach.\nA company called Natura Umana—an offshoot from the team behind Swiss accessory company Rolling Square—has made a pair of wireless earbuds called HumanPods. They have microphones, but you have to double-tap an earbud to turn them on and trigger the onboard AI.\nLike the Omi and Bee AI Pioneer, the HumanPods are designed to be worn all day, though the battery won't last more than a day. They're not in-ears, but they hang pretty well on the ears and were comfy in my limited time testing them at CES. The system also employs multiple large language models, but rather than listening to everything around you, these earbuds are designed around you talking to the AI.\nAnd there are multiple AI avatars you can chat with. Athena is the fitness and health AI persona, and the idea is that if you connect your fitness and health wearables and apps with it, you'll be able to ask questions like what exercises you should do today. Athena will look at your health data and suggest a workout based on what data it has available, like your sleep history and heart rate. Hector is another AI persona I spoke to; he's supposed to be the “AI therapist.” I talked to him about the stress of CES, and he suggested ways to make the event less stressful, like focusing on just a few companies to talk to. (Carlo Edoardo Ferraris, the company founder, tells me Hector has disclaimers that he is not a licensed therapist, of course.)\nJust as we have different people in our lives we go to for different things, Ferraris says there will be an AI persona for your specific needs. He wants to establish a marketplace where people can publish personas—like an AI therapist developed by a mental health startup.\nThe earbuds will arrive in the first quarter of this year, and Android support will arrive either at the same time or in the second quarter. There's no firm price for the earbuds, though it may sit around the $100 mark. Of course, there will be a subscription.\nAll of these AI wearables are following the disastrous launch of the Humane Ai Pin, which was one of the most high-profile tech launches of 2024. Omi creator Shevchenko believes his company is already in a better place than Humane because it's launching with dozens of apps to enhance the AI assistant's capabilities. Ferraris thinks Natura Umana's wearable will be more successful because wireless earbuds are easy to understand and the app is designed like a messaging app—things people are already familiar with.\nMore often than not, wearables like these overpromise and underdeliver, and these always-listening AI-powered devices may not actually prove as helpful as their founders intend. Still, these vanguards in the wearable industry are pushing us toward an era when always-listening gadgets on our wrists and heads could grow to be more helpful. A microphone that's always on could quickly be seen as the new normal. The privacy concerns that come with such a push are bound to raise alarms, and what we don't yet know is whether those alarms will be loud enough to slow this steady march.",

    "content_text": "It’s a social networking company with close ties to the incoming Trump administration. It deploys a “community notes” system to fight misinformation and lets hateful comments fly under the banner of “free speech.” It’s got a hefty side-gig in AI. It’s setting up shop in Texas. It’s run by a guy worth hundreds of billions of dollars and the fashion sense of someone a couple of decades younger. No, not X. It’s Meta.\nIt may soon be hard to tell the difference. Meta this week said it would torpedo its fact-checking partners in favor of X’s “community notes” model (a comparison Meta chief global policy officer Joel Kaplan made directly in a blog post yesterday) and used the fig leaf of “free speech” to make alarmingly permissive changes to its Hateful Conduct policy. Last week, it appointed friend of Donald Trump and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, and elevated Kaplan, who is firmly entrenched in Republican circles.\n“I’ve been expecting Meta to axe this program for years,” says Alexios Matzarlis, director of Cornell University’s Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative and founding director of the International Fact-Checking Network, which helped establish the partnership between Facebook and fact-checkers in 2016. “But not in this manner and with this timing, which is so nakedly political.”\nX seems like it should be a cautionary tale rather than a North Star for Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Advertisers and users alike have reportedly fled in droves since Musk took. Timelines are increasingly filled with far-right debate-me edgelord accounts that post a constant churn of misinformation. (And that’s just the owner.) Yet Meta has made clear that this is the future it wants.\n“As well-intentioned as many of these efforts have been, they have expanded over time to the point where we are making too many mistakes, frustrating our users and too often getting in the way of the free expression we set out to enable,” Kaplan wrote of the fact-checking program and other moderation tools. “We want to fix that and return to that fundamental commitment to free expression.”\nThe appeal to “free expression” mirrors Musk’s, although in Meta’s case it seems less about commitment to abstract ideals than it is a concerted effort to make nice with MAGA; Meta has spent years unsuccessfully trying to counter claims of bias from conservatives and now has chosen to abandon the fight entirely. You can’t work the referees if there aren’t any to begin with.\nBut at what cost? Well, potentially plenty. Fact-checking is not beyond reproach, and community notes can be effective as part of a broader moderation system. But little in Kaplan’s announcement of the changes—or Zuckerberg’s accompanying video—gave much hope that this will be an upgrade.\n“From what I’ve seen so far, it seems like it’ll be an unmitigated disaster,” says Alex Mahavedan, director of the Poynter Institute’s digital media literacy project, MediaWise. (The Poynter Institute also operates PolitiFact, which is a Meta fact-checking partner.) By putting so much emphasis on something so nebulous as “free speech” as the ultimate goal—never mind that fact-checking is itself a form of speech—Meta risks a permissiveness that allows misinformation to flourish, Mahavedan says. He’s not alone.\n“Meta has perennially been a home for Russian, Chinese, and Iranian disinformation,” claims Gordon Crovitz, co-CEO of NewsGuard, a company that provides a tool to evaluate the trustworthiness of online information. “Now, Meta apparently has decided to open the floodgates completely.\"\nAgain, fact-checking isn’t perfect; Croviz says that NewsGuard has tracked several “false narratives” on Meta’s platforms already. And the community notes model with which Meta will replace its fact-checking battalions can still be somewhat effective. But research from Mahavedan and others has shown that crowdsourced solutions miss vast swaths of misinformation. And unless Meta commits to maximal transparency in how its version is implemented and used, it will be impossible to know whether the systems are working at all.\nIt’s also unlikely that the switch to community notes will solve the “bias” problem Meta executives cite are so outwardly concerned about, given that it seems unlikely to exist in the first place.\n“The motivator for all of this changing of Meta’s policies and Musk’s takeover of Twitter is this accusation of social media companies being biased against conservatives,” said David Rand, a behavioral scientist at MIT. “There’s just not good evidence of that.”\nIn a recently published paper in Nature, Rand and his coauthors found that while Twitter users who used a Trump-related hashtag in 2020 were more than four times likelier to ultimately be suspended than those who used pro-Biden hashtags, they were also much more likely to have shared “low-quality” or misleading news.\n“Just because there’s a difference in who’s getting acted on, that doesn’t mean there’s bias,” says Rand. “Crowd ratings can do a pretty good job of reproducing the fact-checker ratings … You’re still going to see more conservatives get sanctioned than liberals.”\nAnd while X gets outsize attention in part because of Musk, remember that it’s an order of magnitude smaller than Facebook’s 3 billion monthly active users, which will present its own challenges when Meta installs its own community notes-style system. “There’s a reason there’s only one Wikipedia in the world,” says Matzarlis. “It’s very hard to get a crowdsourced anything off the ground at scale.”\nAs for the loosening of Meta’s Hateful Conduct policy, that in itself is an inherently political choice. It’s still allowing some things and not allowing others; moving those boundaries to accommodate bigotry does not mean they don’t exist. It just means that Meta is more OK with it than it was the day before.\nSo much depends on exactly how Meta’s system will work in practice. But between the moderation changes and the community guidelines overhaul, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads are careening toward a world where anyone can say that gay and trans people have a “mental illness,” where AI slop will proliferate even more aggressively, where outrageous claims spread unchecked, where truth itself is malleable.\nYou know: just like X.",

    "content_text": "Meta caused a stir last week when it let slip that it intends to populate its platform with a significant number of entirely artificial users in the not too distant future.\n“We expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do,” Connor Hayes, vice-president of product for generative AI at Meta, told The Financial Times. “They’ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform ... that’s where we see all of this going.”\nThe fact that Meta seems happy to fill its platform with AI slop and accelerate the “enshittification” of the internet as we know it is concerning. Some people then noticed that Facebook was in fact already awash with strange AI-generated individuals, most of which stopped posting a while ago. These included for example, “Liv,” a “proud Black queer momma of 2 & truth-teller, your realest source of life’s ups & downs,” a persona that went viral as people marveled at its awkward sloppiness. Meta began deleting these earlier fake profiles after they failed to get engagement from any real users.\nLet’s pause from hating on Meta for a moment though. It’s worth noting that AI-generated social personas can also be a valuable research tool for scientists looking to explore how AI can mimic human behavior.\nAn experiment called GovSim, run in late 2024, illustrates how useful it can be to study how AI characters interact with one another. The researchers behind the project wanted to explore the phenomenon of collaboration between humans with access to a shared resource such as shared land for grazing livestock. Several decades ago, the Nobel prize–winning economist Elinor Ostrom showed that, instead of depleting such a resource, real communities tend to figure out how to share it through informal communication and collaboration, without any imposed rules.\nMax Kleiman-Weiner, a professor at the University of Washington and one of those involved with the GovSim work, says it was partly inspired by a Stanford project called Smallville, which I previously wrote about in AI Lab. Smallville is a Farmville-like simulation involving characters that communicate and interact with each other under the control of large language models.\nKleiman-Weiner and colleagues wanted to see if AI characters would engage in the kind of cooperation that Ostrom found. The team tested 15 different LLMs, including those from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, on three imaginary scenarios: a fishing community with access to the same lake; shepherds who share land for their sheep; and a group of factory owners who need to limit their collective pollution.\nIn 43 out of 45 simulations they found that the AI personas failed to share resources correctly, although smarter models did do better. “We did see a pretty strong correlation between how powerful the LLM was and how able it was to sustain cooperation,” Kleiman-Weiner told me.\nWhat’s more, when they gave their simulated agents additional prompting designed to elicit reflection on the implications of their actions—for example, “What if everybody does that?”—they found that the simulations stood a much better chance of sustaining their resources. The research shows how AI can simulate community behavior and might provide useful clues for getting future AI agents to work nicely with one another.\nNone of this is to say that Meta plans to run valuable research experiments with its AI users—although the company does have a history of using simulated users to test its infrastructure.\nIt’s much more likely that Meta has seen the kind of engagement achieved by Character AI and other companies that let users interact with different chatbot personas. Users reportedly spend about two hours per day on Character’s app or site, and Meta would no doubt like to achieve something similar with its platform.\nThe trajectory seems inevitable with Mark Zuckerberg telling investors that the company sees AI personas as a big part of its future. “I have high confidence that, over the next several years, this is going to be an important trend,” he said on Meta’s Q3 2024 earnings call.\nEven if Meta can figure out a way for its AI users to drive more engagement, it will be part of an experiment that risks creating a slop-filled platform in the end.\nHow do you feel about this influx of artificial users on Meta's platforms? Are you happy—or even just curious—to engage with them? Or are you more skeptical about this trend? Please share your thoughts in the comments below!",

    "content_text": "Since Donald Trump won back the presidency on November 5, a parade of Silicon Valley luminaries have been engaging in an unseemly grovel-fest, making pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago, shoveling million-dollar contributions to his inaugural fund, and meddling in the editorial departments of the publications they own in an apparent attempt to gain the new leader’s favor. Yesterday, Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, “hold my beer.”\nIn a five-minute Instagram video, rocking his new curly hairdo and a $900,000 Gruebal Forsey watch, Zuckerberg announced a series of drastic policy changes that could open the floodgates of misinformation and hate speech on Facebook, Threads, and Instagram. His rationale parroted talking points that right-wing legislators, pundits, and Trump himself have been hammering for years. And Zuckerberg wasn’t coy about the timing, explicitly saying the new political regime was a factor in his thinking: “The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech,” he said in the video.\nIn Zuckerberg’s telling, the main impetus for the change is the desire to boost “free expression.” Meta’s social networks had become too extreme in restricting the speech of users, he said, so the thrust of the changes—which included ending Meta’s multiyear partnerships with third-party fact-checking organizations and retreating from efforts to diminish the spread of hate speech—is to let freedom ring, even if it means “we’re gonna catch less bad stuff.”\nBut the tell is in Zuckerberg’s nomenclature. He described his company’s (not completely successful) efforts to avoid promoting toxic content as “censorship.” He has now adopted the same bad-faith characterizations of his employees’ work that the political right did, which used it as a bludgeon to force Facebook to allow ultraconservatives to promote things like targeted harassment and intentional misinformation. In reality, Meta has every right to police its content in the way that it wants—“censorship” is something governments do, and private companies are simply exercising their own free speech rights by deciding what content is appropriate for their users and advertisers.\nZuckerberg first indicated that he might be OK with the term in a simpering letter he wrote last August to Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, saying that the Biden administration wanted Meta to “censor” some content related to the Covid-19 pandemic. (The content remained, which actually illustrates that Facebook is granted the power to shape free expression in the US, not the government.) But in his Instagram post yesterday, Zuckerberg bear-hugged the term, using it as a synonym for the entire practice of content moderation itself. “We’re going to dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms,” he promised. An alternate reading might be—we’re letting the dobermans out!\nIn the same letter to Jordan, the former left-leaning CEO took a vow that he would no longer side with either political party. “My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another—or to even appear to be playing a role,” he wrote. Now that Trump is elected, that’s all out the window. “It feels like we’re in a new era now,” he said in yesterday’s video. Apparently, it’s an era where private companies change their rules to ensure they’re in sync with the party in power. In the last week alone, Zuckerberg replaced the departing Nick Clegg, the company’s former president of global affairs, with Joel Kaplan, a former GOP operative and clerk to the late Justice Anthony Scalia, who once urged Facebook to ignore misinformation during the 2016 election. Zuckerberg also tapped Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White, an ardent Trump supporter, to sit on Meta’s board.\nAnother indication that there’s a MAGA element to these changes is Zuckerberg’s announcement that he’s moving Meta’s trust and safety and content moderation teams from California to Texas. Once again, he said out loud that the reasons for the geographical move were political: “I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams.” Hello, Mark? This move simply anchors Meta’s content arbiters in a location with a potentially different bias. It’s also a conspicuous statement that Zuckerberg himself might consider California—Trump’s kryptonite—as a less savory place to work than deep-red Texas.\nIronically, this is all happening at a moment when Meta has arguably succeeded in making improvements to its once-miserable record of taking down hate speech and other legal, but toxic, posts. In 2019, when I spent a day in one of the company’s content moderation offices, the beleaguered moderators working there told me that dealing with gray areas like hate speech was the one thing that AI could never do. But more recently, Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun revealed that generative AI tools had changed the game. “Five years ago, of all the hate speech that Facebook removed from the platform, about 20 to 25 percent was taken down preemptively by AI systems before anybody saw it,” he told me in an interview late in 2023. “Last year, it was 95 percent.”\nNow, Meta says it’s throwing that win into the dumpster. It will change the algorithm, and AI will no longer proactively block “lower severity” policy violations like hate speech and, presumably, bullying. (Meta says that it remains committed to vigilantly blocking “high severity” illegal content, like terrorism and child exploitation.) Meta also has made a series of changes to its speech policies permitting certain kinds of comments formerly deemed hateful. One of those hits a right-wing hot button—gender and sexual identity. For example, now it’s OK to allege that gay or transgender people are mentally ill or call them just plain weird on Facebook.\nTo be fair, elements of what Zuck is proposing do make some sense—but he’s mischaracterizing the past. Granted, its fact-checking experiment hasn’t been entirely successful, but one reason for the failure was Meta’s inability to commit to it fully, in part, because of right-wing criticism. There have been cases where overzealous algorithmic takedowns have stifled useful discussions, as well as plenty of instances where permitted speech was taken down erroneously. But Meta’s silly blocking of conversation starters like “women shouldn’t serve in combat roles” (which has now been reversed) were usually less a result of bad rules or algorithms than insufficient investment in human content moderation, which can make more nuanced distinctions.\nDetails aside, it’s impossible to ignore the context of this announcement, especially when Zuckerberg himself is so up-front about it. This is a MAGA move. When Biden was in the White House, Zuckerberg wanted nothing to do with politics—now, he says, he will no longer downrank political posts. Furthermore, he says, “we’re going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more.” Give Zuckerberg credit for transparency: Meta is saying it embraces Trump and conservative values, and now it’s betting Trump will use his power to thwart foreign attempts to regulate its business. Hours after Zuckerberg’s post, Trump himself gave credence to that interpretation: After praising Meta’s moves, he was asked if Zuckerberg was responding to threats Trump has made about Meta. “Probably,” said the president-elect.\nZuckerberg has always put Meta’s business interests first, but he wasn’t always this transactional with content moderation. In the years I followed the company closely, especially during the multiple conversations we had in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election, I found him to be thoughtful and genuinely concerned about the impact that his policies had on users and society in general, even if many of his decisions wound up coming down on the side of maximizing profit, engagement, or growth, rather than comity. And while he indeed was concerned about “free expression” during those years—which he made a focus of a carefully orchestrated 2019 speech at Georgetown University that he referenced in his post yesterday—he also took pains to set up a vast bureaucracy of policy teams and content moderators. He now seems to be dismantling those efforts, or at least exiling them to Texas, in favor of crowdsourced “Community Notes,” as currently seen on X.\nThe new Zuckerberg seems less concerned about the criticism that he knows will come of these moves—and he doesn’t even have to move to Texas to avoid it. There’s a sense of liberation in his short speech announcement, almost as if he was washing his hands of a decade-long content moderation controversy before turning back to his real passions of AI and mixed reality. He’s one person, at least, exulting in the joys of free expression.\nDon't miss future subscriber-only editions of this column. Subscribe to WIRED (50% off for Plaintext readers) today.",

In reality, Meta has every right to police its content in the way that it wants—“censorship” is something governments do, and private companies are simply exercising their own free speech rights by deciding what content is appropriate for their users and advertisers.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Zuckerberg first indicated that he might be OK with the term in a <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://x.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1828201780544504064/photo/1\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://x.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1828201780544504064/photo/1\" href=\"https://x.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1828201780544504064/photo/1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">simpering letter</a> he wrote last August to Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, saying that the Biden administration wanted Meta to “censor” some content related to the Covid-19 pandemic. (The content remained, which actually illustrates that Facebook is granted the power to shape free expression in the US, not the government.) But in his Instagram post yesterday, Zuckerberg bear-hugged the term, using it as a synonym for the entire practice of content moderation itself. “We’re going to dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms,” he promised. An alternate reading might be—we’re letting the dobermans out!</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">In the same letter to Jordan, the former left-leaning CEO took a vow that he would no longer side with either political party. “My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another—or to even appear to be playing a role,” he wrote. Now that Trump is elected, that’s all out the window. “It feels like we’re in a new era now,” he said in yesterday’s video. Apparently, it’s an era where private companies change their rules to ensure they’re in sync with the party in power. In the last week alone, Zuckerberg replaced the departing Nick Clegg, the company’s former president of global affairs, with <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-joel-kaplan-washington-political-influence/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joel Kaplan</a>, a former GOP operative and clerk to the late Justice Anthony Scalia, who <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">once urged</a> Facebook to ignore misinformation during the 2016 election. Zuckerberg also tapped Ultimate Fighting Championship president <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/06/ufcs-dana-white-joins-metas-board-weeks-before-trump-takes-office.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/06/ufcs-dana-white-joins-metas-board-weeks-before-trump-takes-office.html\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/06/ufcs-dana-white-joins-metas-board-weeks-before-trump-takes-office.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dana White</a>, an ardent Trump supporter, to sit on Meta’s board.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Another indication that there’s a MAGA element to these changes is Zuckerberg’s announcement that he’s moving Meta’s trust and safety and content moderation teams from California to Texas. Once again, he said out loud that the reasons for the geographical move were political: “I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams.” Hello, Mark? This move simply anchors Meta’s content arbiters in a location with a potentially <em>different</em> bias. It’s also a conspicuous statement that Zuckerberg himself might consider California—Trump’s kryptonite—as a less savory place to work than deep-red Texas.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Ice moons such as Jupiter’s Europa and Saturn’s Enceladus are currently at the forefront of the search for extraterrestrial life, as it is believed that beneath their thick icy shells there are vast internal oceans that could potentially support life.\nIn October, NASA launched the Europa Clipper probe to learn more about the conditions on Europa, and now there are several R&D efforts underway to directly explore the interior oceans of these icy moons.\nOne such project, called SWIM (Sensing With Independent Micro-swimmers), is being led by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The program plans to send a number of palm-sized autonomous underwater robots into the ice moons’ internal oceans to search for signs of life.\nAmong the ice moons of Jupiter and Saturn there are several that have vast oceans beneath their thick ice shells, and they are collectively known as the “ocean worlds.” The most famous example is Europa.\nEuropa has a diameter of about 3,120 kilometers—which is roughly a quarter the diameter of Earth—and its surface is covered by a thick ice shell estimated to be about 3 to 30 kilometers thick.\nEuropa’s orbit is an ellipse, and the satellite’s shape is affected by Jupiter’s gravity, becoming deformed when it passes closer to Jupiter.\nThis change in shape creates friction inside Europa, generating enormous amounts of heat in a mechanism known as tidal heating, which melts some of the ice and forms a vast internal ocean beneath the moon’s thick ice shell.\nEuropa’s internal ocean is salty and is estimated to be about 100 kilometers deep on average, with a total volume of water twice that of all Earth’s oceans, despite this moon being considerably smaller than our planet.\nIn addition, it is believed that internal oceans exist on Jupiter’s moons Ganymede and Callisto and Saturn’s moons Titan and Enceladus.\nLiquid water is essential for life as we know it, which is why the ocean worlds are at the forefront of the search for extraterrestrial life.\nUnder the Sea (of Ice)\nThe autonomous underwater exploration robots envisioned by SWIM are extremely small. Their wedge-shaped bodies are about 12 centimeters long. A device called a “cryobot” will transport the robots beneath the thick ice shells of these moons, using nuclear energy to melt the ice. The idea is to pack about four dozen robots into the cryobot and have them penetrate the thick ice shell over the course of several years.\nThere are benefits to sending out such a large number of exploration robots. One is that they can explore a wider area. Another is that they are envisioned to operate in teams, so that multiple robots can explore the same area in overlapping directions, reducing errors in the observation data.\nEach robot will be equipped with sensors to measure temperature, pressure, acidity, electrical conductivity, and chemical composition of the waters it explores. All of these sensors will be mounted on a chip measuring just a few millimeters square.\n“People might ask, why is NASA developing an underwater robot for space exploration?” says Ethan Schaller, project leader at NASA’s JPL, explaining the motivation behind SWIM. “Because there are places in the solar system that we want to go to look for life—and we think life requires liquid water.”\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED Japan and has been translated from Japanese.",

    "content_text": "With just under two weeks left until former president Donald Trump becomes President Donald Trump, Meta has announced that the company will be fully moving its trust and safety teams—the people responsible for enforcing policies around hate speech and disinformation—to Texas. (It will also be rolling back its fact-checking program.) The decision, said CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a post on Threads, “will help remove the concern that biased employees are overly censoring content.”\nZuckerberg didn’t explain why people who live in Texas would be less prone to bias than those who live in California, but that was perhaps besides the point. This was just the latest in a series of moves—including elevating former Republican operative Joel Kaplan to chief global affairs officer and adding combat-sports promoter Dana White to Meta’s board—that seem to indicate the company is vying to get into the good graces of the new administration. In response, President-elect Trump praised the announcement. “Honestly, I think they’ve come a long way—Meta, Facebook, I think they’ve come a long way,” he said, noting that the change was “probably” made in response to his threats against Zuckerberg.\nBut the move to Texas may have more advantages than just political posturing. Texas is one of two states—the other is Florida—with a law essentially forbidding moderation of a great deal of content on social media platforms. It also has a regulatory system that’s exceptionally friendly to companies. And, as usual, X owner and centibillionaire Elon Musk has led the way.\nIn September, Musk officially moved X’s headquarters from San Francisco to Texas, where his other companies, Starlink and the Boring Company, are also based. At the time, Musk cited California’s gender identity law as the reason for the move. (Meta’s new policy changes now appear to allow users to assert that gay and trans people have mental illnesses.)\n“They're obviously following Elon Musk's lead,” says Nicole Gill, executive director of Accountable Tech. “Just by the signal [sent by] moving their base of operations from what is perceived to be a liberally biased state—it's not—to what’s perceived to be a Republican or conservative-coded state.”\nIn 2021, following the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, the state passed a law that banned social media companies from removing or moderating content based on the user’s political views. State officials could then mandate that platforms keep certain content up in the name of free speech.\nLawsuits challenging the legislation and Florida’s similar law made it to the Supreme Court in 2024, in Moody v. Netchoice. The case has since been returned back to the lower courts, where an appellate court previously ruled that social media companies don’t have the right to censor speech under the First Amendment. But Nora Benavidez, senior counsel at the free speech nonprofit Free Press, says that this environment could be favorable for companies as they roll back content moderation, and could form the legal basis of a challenge similar to Netchoice.\n“Executives are doing everything they can to create an environment conducive for actions they want to take, absent review or accountability from actors like our courts or legislators or others,” she says.\nSince taking over X, formerly Twitter, Musk has become one of Trump’s most important allies, backing his campaign financially and lending the full weight of his own platform to promoting Trump’s talking points during the campaign. He has since sat in on meetings with foreign leaders with the president-elect, and weighed in on staffing choices for the new administration. Other tech leaders have taken note, cozying up to Trump and donating to his inauguration fund. But even before the election, other tech companies were following X’s lead in rolling back policies and protections that had previously been in place.\nFor his part, David Greene, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Meta and other social platforms would likely have to comply with state laws regardless of location. And relocating staff to Texas doesn’t mean all its supposed moderation problems will be fixed. Bias, he says, can cut both ways.\n“Misinformation is really one of many, many, many issues that social media platforms have to deal with,” he says. “Having a moderation team in Texas might raise concerns about bias as well. For example, Texas has laws on the books that make the publication of certain information about the availability of abortion services illegal.”\nBut Benavidez says Texas’ social media law may not be the state’s only appeal. “Once a company is either headquartered or is doing significant business in a state, that allows them to use that state for jurisdiction in whatever future filings they have,” she says.\nIn 2023, X filed a lawsuit in Texas against the nonprofit watchdog Media Matters for America, alleging that the group had disparaged the company by pointing out that hate speech and disinformation on the platform ran next to ads. At the time, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton also announced his office was opening an investigation into the organization. A federal judge in Texas refused to throw out the case in August 2024. X has since changed its terms of service so that any lawsuits against the company must be brought in Texas. Federal ones must be brought in the Northern District of Texas, widely viewed as friendly to Musk’s interests. (The judge in the Media Matters case, for example, reportedly bought and sold stock in Musk’s Tesla company earlier in the year, before the suit was brought.)\nMeta’s terms of service, unlike its community guidelines, so far remain the same, mandating disputes be settled either in the Northern District of California or, at the state level, in San Mateo County. But that could change.\n“The legislative environment, the judicial environment, the gubernatorial environment in Texas is incredibly favorable to executives like Musk, and now Zuckerberg,” says Benavidez.\nGill posits that the regulatory environment in Texas may resemble what companies believe the national regulatory environment will come to look like under a new Trump administration.\n“I think that they are looking ahead and seeing an environment that is going to be dominated by a conservative-leaning and kind of extremist administration,” she says. “So they are moving to places where that’s the norm so they can pre-comply.”\nGill also notes that Meta is facing an antitrust lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission, which a friendly administration could see fit to toss. “By preemptively making these changes that they hope will appease the administration, they may be hoping for a friendly decision in return,” she says.\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "content_text": "At CES 2025, AI is everywhere—just as expected—in the CPU and GPU announcements from the major players in the biz, where every last company is touting how their processors will be the end-all, be-all of AI-driven productivity. Never mind if you don’t know your Stable Diffusion from your DeepL Translate: Your next PC is going to be tuned for all of it.\nNeed help making sense of it all? We sifted through the keynotes and other announcements from the four big chipmakers at CES this year to get the lowdown on what’s in store for the PC space in the months to come. It’s all digested below but, spoiler alert, every one of them says their chips are going to be the fastest and bestest on the market.\nAs a foreword, note that we’re not delving into non-PC announcements here, including things like the Snapdragon Digital Chassis for automotive platforms, Nvidia’s homegrown AI foundational model Cosmos, or chips specifically designed for use in robotics or various smart home technologies.\nIntel\nIntel has launched a glut of new Core and Core Ultra processors—a total of eight different series across three major product lines—along with some minor upgrades to existing chips. While Intel is in the unenviable position of playing catch-up to much of the market on performance, its efficiency-focused messaging isn’t overwhelmingly convincing that things are going to change quickly—though it does have some muscle hitting the market. Here’s what’s new, and you can get the full low-down from Intel here.\nIntel’s Core Ultra Series 2 (Arrow Lake) launched in October to a collective groan. The chips were supposed to make Intel competitive with other platforms, but for the most part performance was static over the previous generation of Core Ultra chips, with particularly weak gaming performance. They also aren’t Copilot+ PCs: Only Intel’s Lunar Lake–based machines are able to be classified as Copilot+ PC systems, thanks to their improved neural processing unit.\nThe new Core Ultra laptop chips target gamers and enthusiasts (200HX), premium laptops (200H), and ultralights (200U)—with a total of 15 new SKUs announced across the Ultra 5, 7, and 9 series. Chips will have between 10 and 24 cores and do not have memory on the die. Only the 200H line will use Intel’s upscaled integrated Arc graphics; the others will opt for lower-end silicon (though 200HX systems will surely pair the chip with discrete graphics processing).\nAs they’re built on Arrow Lake and not the newer Lunar Lake, all three new chips will still miss out on Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC designation. Despite boasting overall performance of 99 TOPS, the NPUs on these chips won’t have enough juice to hit the requirement of 40 TOPS (Trillions of Operations Per Second) delivered on their own. For what it’s worth, Intel’s messaging strongly stresses that “TOPS alone does not define AI performance.”\nThis series is a desktop-class chip collection denoted by the lack of an “Ultra” in the name. The 200S is a new design, formally code-named Bartlett Lake, while the 200H and 100U are updates of the 13th- and 14th-generation Intel Core “Raptor Lake” platform, which launched in October 2022. Intel didn't share much on what distinguishes these chips or where they’re likely to end up.\nCodenamed Twin Lake, the Intel Core 3 and the Intel (no model name) processor are both very low-power chips (as low as 6 watts) targeted at “low-power, low-cost edge systems.” Imagine these showing up in bare-bones laptops and embedded systems like storage devices, televisions, and so on.\nThis is an existing Lunar Lake chip that is getting Intel vPro features, which is an enterprise management and security system.\nQualcomm\nQualcomm had a lot of news, but its PC-centric announcement list was relatively tame, limited to these two updates. Complete details can be found here.\nThis is the fourth platform in the Snapdragon series and the lowest cost of them all, designed to be installed in Copilot+ PCs in the rock-bottom $600 range. It’s a single-SKU, 8-core chip with stated performance of 45 TOPS. Qualcomm is also targeting mini desktop PCs with this chip for the first time. Devices are expected in “early 2025.”\nSnapdragon Copilot+ PCs famously can’t run a number of applications, including most VPN software and various cloud storage apps. That’s been changing in recent weeks (many of these apps are now in beta), and Qualcomm says it’s only going to get better.\nAMD\nGiven AMD’s recent gains in the market—it has over a third of the x86 market today—I was expecting some big news from the chipmaker, but that wasn’t the case. AMD announced a handful of new CPUs in a fairly no-nonsense presentation focused largely on its performance leadership and how much the company loved video games. Notably absent at the keynote: No announcement or even much of a mention of new Radeon GPUs, though a new series was revealed after the presentation. (About half of the presentation was dedicated to corporate devices and the company’s many enterprise partnerships.)\nHere’s what’s coming, all in Q1 and Q2 of 2025. Complete details can be found here and here.\nThis is AMD’s fastest and most advanced CPU to date, featuring 16 or 12 cores and purpose-built for creators and (especially) gamers. AMD says the new chip will provide an average 8 percent performance boost on gaming framerates and a 10 percent improvement on other tasks.\nThe Ryzen AI chip isn’t an NPU but rather a CPU that’s tuned for overall performance, including AI workloads. The first Ryzen AI CPU—the Ryzen AI 300—launched in late 2024, and a collection of much faster follow-ups are arriving soon, topping out at the Ryzen AI Max (available in seven different SKUs). With up to 16 cores and support for 128 GB of memory, AMD says the AI Max offers NPU performance of 50 TOPS. AMD naturally says the Max is embarrassingly fast at all kinds of tasks—and boldly says it can compete with the Apple M4 CPU on some of them. Ryzen AI chips are also set to show up in mini PC designs.\nAMD hasn’t revealed much detail about what would distinguish its latest GPU, except that the 9070 line is targeted at midrange users. More notable is that AMD’s naming scheme is evolving to align more closely with how Nvidia names its products. The 9070 and 9070 XT are coming this quarter.\nNvidia\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang took to the stage in a sparkly jacket and spent close to two hours outlining the company’s upcoming plans—and as expected it’s virtually all about AI. But rather little of the keynote covered Nvidia’s bread-and-butter GPUs, which include this new stuff. Complete details can be found here and here.\nSurprising no one, Nvidia announced a new graphics processor, the GeForce RTX 50 series. On the desktop, these GPUs will launch at the end of January 2025. The big advance is a technology called Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) 4 and Multi Frame Generation, which uses AI techniques to generate part of the pixel stream instead of doing so via brute force tactics, dramatically improving performance. Huang says the new graphics card has up to 4,000 TOPS of AI power. The top-tier card in the series—the 5090—will run a mere $1,999.\nThe RTX 50 series is also being shrunk down for laptop implementations, starting in March 2025. You’ll get a bit less than half the performance from the mobile version vs. the desktop, but Huang says AI will ensure your laptop won’t melt while you’re using it. Prices for RTX 50-equipped laptops will run up to $2,899, providing a maximum power of 1,850 AI TOPS.\nThis is the backbone for Nvidia Project Digits, “a personal AI supercomputer” that will bring Nvidia’s Blackwell AI platform to the masses. Want to run inference on your desktop, offline? Digits and the GB10 “AI superchip” are going to make that possible—with 1 petaflop (1,000 TOPS) of performance. The system will cost a minimum of $3,000, with availability in May 2025.",

    "content_text": "Yesterday, health officials in Louisiana announced that a patient who was hospitalized with severe bird flu in December has died. The individual contracted bird flu after exposure to a backyard flock and wild birds. It is the first death recorded in the United States attributed to H5N1, or avian influenza.\nThe person was over the age of 65 and reportedly had underlying medical conditions. The Louisiana Health Department has not released any more details about the patient.\nA total of 66 people in the US tested positive for bird flu in 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all of the other cases, people developed mild symptoms and made a full recovery. But the Louisiana case is a stark reminder that avian flu can be dangerous. And as the number of human infections rises, health experts worry about more cases of severe illness—and potentially more deaths.\n“This is an ongoing game of Russian roulette,” says physician Nahid Bhadelia, founding director of the Center on Emerging Infectious Diseases at Boston University. “The more virus there is in our environment, the more chances there are for it to come into contact with humans.” It was only a matter of time before bird flu turned deadly, she says.\nThe US is in the middle of an H5N1 outbreak that shows no signs of stopping. The virus has infected more than 130 million birds, including commercial poultry, since January 2022. In April 2024 it spilled into dairy cows for the first time. Though not fatal for cows, the virus has sickened more than 900 dairy herds in 16 states.\nMost people who come down with bird flu are farm workers or others who have direct contact with sick animals. Of the 66 confirmed infections in the US last year, 40 had exposure to dairy cows, while 23 had exposure to poultry and culling operations. In the three other cases, the exact source of exposure is unknown.\nSince 2003, more than 850 human cases of H5N1 bird flu have been reported outside the United States, and about half of those have resulted in death. In a statement released Monday, the CDC said a death from H5N1 bird flu “is not unexpected because of the known potential for infection with these viruses to cause severe illness and death.” Federal health officials say the risk of getting bird flu remains low for the general public, and there is no evidence that the virus is spreading from person to person anywhere in the country.\nOne of the puzzling aspects of the current US outbreak is why all the human infections until now have resulted in mild illness. “It could be that they're young, healthy people,” says Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center and a professor of epidemiology at Brown University. “It could be that the way they're being exposed is different from how we've historically seen people get infected. There are a number of hypotheses, but at this point they're all just guesses.”\nNuzzo says it’s very possible that the Louisiana patient’s preexisting health conditions contributed to the severity of their illness, but also points to the case of a teenager in Canada who was hospitalized with bird flu in November.\nThe 13-year-old girl was initially seen at an emergency department in British Columbia for a fever and conjunctivitis in both eyes. She was discharged home without treatment and later developed a cough, vomiting, and diarrhea. She wound up back in the emergency department in respiratory distress a few days later.

To prevent illness, health officials recommend avoiding direct contact with wild birds and other animals infected with or suspected to be infected with bird flu viruses.",

Learn more.\nI have never been afraid of a commercially available health tracker before the Abbott Lingo.\nIf you have diabetes or know someone who does, the small, wearable biosensor will probably look pretty familiar. You slap it on your arm and a small filament slides directly under your skin to convey data on your blood glucose levels to the sensor, connecting to your phone via Bluetooth so you can easily monitor them. If you’re diabetic, keeping your blood sugar levels stable means avoiding long-term health problems down the road. If you’re not, it means you can maximize your athletic performance … or just prevent that 3 pm brain fog.\nThe Lingo has been out for several months, but I have been delaying testing it. Besides the major squick factor, I’m not sure what I’d do with the data. I know I would benefit from eating more fiber, more whole grains, and lean proteins. It's just … well, I’m a working mom of two, and I don’t have a personal chef making me chicken breasts at home.\nI’ve measured my body fat composition with electric currents and taken pictures of my unclothed self for AI analysis before now. But the latest round of health monitoring tests go much deeper, and at CES 2025, I've been able to take a closer look at a few of them.\nSpit Take\nI do feel especially bad for chickening out on continuous glucose monitoring, because Lingo isn’t even the first commercially available blood glucose monitor at the moment. Technically, the first to launch was the Stelo last year, from diabetes equipment manufacturer Dexcom.\nDexcom also has an Apple Watch app and recently announced a new partnership with the smart ring manufacturer Oura, which would add blood sugar monitoring to the list of already extensive biometrics that you can check on the Oura app. (It’s worth noting here that Dexcom also invested $75 million in Oura’s Series D funding.) Dexcom’s most recent innovation has been to launch a proprietary GenAI platform to offer its users weekly insights, with personalized tips regarding diet, exercise, and sleep. (Stop eating cake! Start walking around!)\nWhat other metrics is your Fitbit or Garmin missing? How about arterial health? Enter the Conneqt Pulse, a new arterial health monitor designed for personal use. It looks like a blood pressure cuff and measures multiple factors that are related to cardiac health, like brachial blood pressure or augmentation pressure—a measure of arterial stiffness that’s associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity.\nI asked Catherine Liao, Conneqt’s chief strategy officer, if people who were not cardiologists would be able to interpret and act upon the data collected by the Conneqt Pulse. She acknowledged that education would be an important part of getting customers to use it, but once educated, quantified selfers would be able to use this data as part of maintaining heart health as they age.\nMaybe you would like to monitor your hormones. The Eli Health Hormometer lets you monitor cortisol and progesterone levels with simple saliva tests. Unwrap a stick, let the absorbent tip soak in your mouth for up to one minute, then use the camera on your phone to scan the test strip. The Eli Health app gives you results that you used to only be able to obtain in a doctor’s office.\nSimilarly, Vivoo, which makes simple strip tests (we wrote about the company’s UTI at-home diagnostic last year), launched a suite of women’s health tests this year, with everything from the standard ovulation and pregnancy tests to an in-home fertility test. This checks for the presence of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and also runs a vaginal pH test to see if your vagina is perhaps an inhospitable home for sperm.\nOr maybe you’d just like to measure it all. Withings’ Omnia is a concept product not for sale in the consumer market just yet (there are only two, currently), but we saw it at Unveiled this year. You simply step onto the platform and every single measurement that any Withings equipment has made shows up on an attractive mirrored interface. A voice AI assistant then helps you come up with actionable plans surrounding your health.\nWithings also used CES to launch Cardio Checkup, an in-app service that's available now and is compatible with every Withings device that has ECG capabilities, like the ScanWatch. In addition to alerting you to possible cases of atrial fibrillation, it will, true to its name, check up on you quarterly and give you access to specialists through the app.\nGet Better\nAnd that's not all—I've got several more days of meetings to go. It’s a strange time to see CES peppered with so much home medtech. The coronavirus pandemic spurred a surge in digital health innovations, but 2024 has been a reckoning—CNBC analyzed 39 digital health public companies and noted that two-thirds of them were down for the year, or even out of business.\nThe pullback could be related to the fact that consumers have decided, quite reasonably, that we might not want to know this much. It’s just a lot easier to monitor your cortisol levels than it is to do anything about the conditions that produced them, like quit your job, or stop wildfires from happening.\nWhen I spoke to Abbott representatives, I learned that I was not the only one who was squeamish about inserting filaments under my skin. (I am still waiting for my Apple Watch to track my blood sugar.)\nStill, I finally pulled myself together and inserted the Lingo at Pepcom. Under the watchful guidance of Abbott representatives, I pulled up my shirt sleeve, put the sensor into the dispenser and tapped it onto my skin. It went on with a click. The sensation was similar to someone flicking my arm forcefully with their finger—a slight sting, but not like a thousand needles of fire were going under my skin.\nI connected the sensor to the Lingo app and wore it overnight. When I woke up this morning, I discovered—after one night—that I went hypoglycemic in my sleep. I’ve been bottoming out from walking too much and not eating enough at CES! So much for not providing actionable advice. I’ll eat my words (and a snack before I go to bed).",

    "content_text": "Meta announced a series of major updates to its content moderation policies today, including ending its fact-checking partnerships and “getting rid” of restrictions on speech about “topics like immigration, gender identity and gender” that the company describes as frequent subjects of political discourse and debate. “It’s not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms,” Meta’s newly appointed chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, wrote in a blog post outlining the changes.\nIn an accompanying video, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the company’s current rules in these areas as “just out of touch with mainstream discourse.”\nIn tandem with this announcement, the company made a number of updates across its Community Guidelines, an extensive set of rules that outline what kinds of content are prohibited on Meta’s platforms, including Instagram, Threads, and Facebook. Some of the most striking changes were made to Meta’s “Hateful Conduct” policy, which covers discussions on immigration and gender.\nIn a notable shift, the company now says it allows “allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like ‘weird.’”\nIn other words, Meta now appears to permit users to accuse transgender or gay people of being mentally ill because of their gender expression and sexual orientation. The company did not respond to requests for clarification on the policy.\nMeta spokesperson Corey Chambliss told WIRED these restrictions will be loosened globally. When asked whether the company will adopt different policies in countries with strict regulations governing hate speech, Chambliss pointed to Meta's current guidelines for addressing local laws.\nOther significant changes made to Meta’s Hateful Conduct policy Tuesday include:\n- Removing language prohibiting content targeting people based on the basis of their “protected characteristics,” which include race, ethnicity, and gender identity, when they are combined with “claims that they have or spread the coronavirus.” Without this provision, it may now be within bounds to accuse, for example, Chinese people of bearing responsibility for the Covid-19 pandemic.\n- A new addition appears to carve out room for people who want to post about how, for example, women shouldn’t be allowed to serve in the military or men shouldn’t be allowed to teach math because of their gender. Meta now permits content that argues for “gender-based limitations of military, law enforcement, and teaching jobs. We also allow the same content based on sexual orientation, when the content is based on religious beliefs.”\n- Another update elaborates on what Meta permits in conversations about social exclusion. It now states that “people sometimes use sex- or gender-exclusive language when discussing access to spaces often limited by sex or gender, such as access to bathrooms, specific schools, specific military, law enforcement, or teaching roles, and health or support groups.\" Previously, this carve-out was only available for discussions about keeping health and support groups limited to one gender.\n- Meta’s Hateful Conduct policy previously opened by noting that hateful speech may “promote offline violence.” That sentence, which had been present in the policy since 2019, has been removed from the updated version released Tuesday. (In 2018, following reports from human rights groups, Meta admitted that its platform was used to incite violence against religious minorities in Myanmar.) The update does preserve language toward the bottom of the policy prohibiting content that could “incite imminent violence or intimidation.”\nThe updates similarly preserve a number of older restrictions that Meta has had in place for years. The current version of the policy maintains prohibitions on Holocaust denials, blackface, insinuations about Jewish people controlling the media. It also preserves a specific ban against comparing Black people to “farm equipment.”\nMeta also preserved its previous list of what it calls protected characteristics, which include race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and serious disease, as well as its policy about “protecting migrants, immigrants, and asylum-seekers” from what it characterizes as “Tier 1” or “most severe” attacks, such as content targeting people or groups of people based on their protected characteristics or immigration status.\nIn keeping with the previous version, Meta continues to ban calling immigrants, as well as people in “protected characteristic” groups, insects, animals, pathogens, or “other sub-human life forms” as well as alleging that they are criminals or immoral. It appears that some of the most xenophobic remarks made by high-profile figures—like President Trump’s 2023 statement about undocumented immigrants “poisoning the blood of our country”—may still violate Meta’s policies if posted to its platforms. Meta did not respond to WIRED’s question on whether that specific statement would be permitted.",

    "content_text": "In just 20 minutes this morning, an automated license-plate-recognition (ALPR) system with an IP address geolocated to Tennessee captured photographs and detailed information from nearly 1,000 vehicles as they passed by. Among them: eight black Jeep Wranglers, six Honda Accords, an ambulance, and a yellow Ford Fiesta with a vanity plate.\nThis trove of real-time vehicle data, collected by one of Motorola’s ALPR systems, is meant to be accessible by law enforcement. However, a flaw discovered by a security researcher has exposed live video feeds and detailed records of passing vehicles, revealing the staggering scale of surveillance enabled by this widespread technology.\nMore than 150 Motorola ALPR cameras have exposed their video feeds and leaking data in recent months, according to security researcher Matt Brown, who first publicized the issues in a series of YouTube videos after buying an ALPR camera on eBay and reverse engineering it.\nAs well as broadcasting live footage accessible to anyone on the internet, the misconfigured cameras also exposed data they have collected, including photos of cars and logs of license plates. The real-time video and data feeds don’t require any usernames or passwords to access.\nAlongside other technologists, WIRED has reviewed video feeds from several of the cameras, confirming vehicle data—including makes, models, and colors of cars—have been accidentally exposed. Motorola confirmed the exposures, telling WIRED it was working with its customers to close the access.\nOver the last decade, thousands of ALPR cameras have appeared in towns and cities across the US. The cameras, which are manufactured by companies such as Motorola and Flock Safety, automatically take pictures when they detect a car passing by. The cameras and databases of collected data are frequently used by police to search for suspects. ALPR cameras can be placed along roads, on the dashboards of cop cars, and even in trucks. These cameras capture billions of photos of cars—including occasionally bumper stickers, lawn signs, and T-shirts.\n“Every one of them that I found exposed was in a fixed location over some roadway,” Brown, who runs cybersecurity company Brown Fine Security, tells WIRED. The exposed video feeds each cover a single lane of traffic, with cars driving through the camera’s view. In some streams, snow is falling. Brown found two streams for each exposed camera system, one in color and another in infrared.\nBroadly, when a car passes an ALPR camera, a photograph of the vehicle is taken, and the system uses machine learning to extract text from the license plate. This is stored alongside details such as where the photograph was taken, the time, as well as metadata such as the make and model of the vehicle.\nBrown says the camera feeds and vehicle data were likely exposed as they had not been set up on private networks, possibly by law enforcement bodies deploying them, and instead exposed to the internet without any authentication. “It’s been misconfigured. It shouldn’t be open on the public internet,” he says.\nWIRED tested the flaw by analyzing data streams from 37 different IP addresses apparently tied to Motorola cameras, spanning more than a dozen cities across the United States, from Omaha, Nebraska, to New York City. Within just 20 minutes, those cameras recorded the make, model, color, and license plates of nearly 4,000 vehicles. Some cars were even captured multiple times—up to three times in some cases—as they passed different cameras.\nJehan Wickramasuriya, corporate vice president overseeing license plate recognition products at Motorola Solutions, confirmed to WIRED that some devices were exposed, and that the company plans to introduce new security measures going forward.\n“Some customer-modified network configurations potentially exposed certain IP addresses,” Wickramasuriya says in a statement. The company did not address how many systems were incorrectly configured. Wickramasuriya says if its customers use its “recommended configurations,” there is not a risk of cameras being exposed.\n“We are working directly with these customers to restore their system configurations consistent with our recommendations and industry best practices,” Wickramasuriya says. “Our next firmware update will introduce additional security hardening.”\n“By leaving these incredibly insecure tracking devices on the open internet, police have not only breached public trust but created a bounty of location data for everyone who drives by which can be abused by stalkers and other criminals,” says Cooper Quintin, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which last year found security vulnerabilities in ALPR cameras. “Police shouldn't be collecting this data at all unless there is an active investigation, and even then, the devices must be strictly scrutinized for security and public safety.\"\nBrown initially found the exposed camera data after recently buying one of Motorola’s ALPR cameras on eBay, he says, and reverse engineered it to extract the device’s firmware. The researcher says he found details of both the color and infrared video streams on the device he purchased and was able to access the video from the camera in his testing lab.\nBrown then set out to see whether any devices in the real world were publicly available online. Brown was able to use text from a “404” error page shown by the cameras—including unique language and peculiar grammar—to find IP addresses of exposed devices on the public internet. “I think that is a very unique type of error page that only exists on this device,” Brown says.\nMore than 150 results appear when using publicly available internet-scanning tools. The researcher says these likely belong to a sort of “hub” that is connected to individual cameras, each of which have their own streaming URLs.\nAs ALPR cameras have been deployed by law enforcement agencies, there has been little public debate on their use and the privacy implications that come with collecting and storing billions of images that include people’s location. Civil liberties campaigners have questioned how long data is stored for and the need for such widespread surveillance systems.\n“This is part of a general pattern where governments are inclined to roll out technical systems to meet the specific goals they have without thinking about, let alone working on, the potential negative impacts that those systems have and doing the work that you need to do to minimize the negative impacts,” says Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a senior staff technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\nGillmor points to New Hampshire’s ALPR law as one that is “reasonable.” The law says records from cameras should not “be recorded or transmitted anywhere and shall be purged from the system within 3 minutes of their capture.”\nUpdate 9:45 am EST, January 10, 2025: An ALPR system's IP address reviewed by WIRED geolocated it to Nashville, Tennessee. However, a Motorola spokesperson says “Nashville's is not among the customer-modified network configurations that potentially exposed certain IP addresses.” Given the relative imprecision of IP-based geolocation data, we have removed the specific reference to Nashville.",

Motorola confirmed the exposures, telling WIRED it was working with its customers to close the access.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Over the last decade, thousands of ALPR cameras have appeared in towns and cities across the US. The cameras, which are manufactured by companies such as Motorola and Flock Safety, automatically take pictures when they detect a car passing by. The cameras and databases of collected data are frequently used by police to search for suspects. ALPR cameras can be placed along roads, on the dashboards of cop cars, and even in trucks. These cameras capture <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/license-plate-readers-political-signs-bumper-stickers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">billions of photos of cars—including occasionally bumper stickers, lawn signs, and T-shirts</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“Every one of them that I found exposed was in a fixed location over some roadway,” Brown, who runs cybersecurity company Brown Fine Security, tells WIRED.

Brown found two streams for each exposed camera system, one in color and another in infrared.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Broadly, when a car passes an ALPR camera, a photograph of the vehicle is taken, and the system uses machine learning to extract text from the license plate.

    "content_text": "Meta’s fact-checking partners claim they were “blindsided” by the company’s decision to abandon third-party fact-checking on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads in favor of a Community Notes model, and some say they are now scrambling to figure out if they can survive the hole this leaves in their funding.\n“We heard the news just like everyone else,” says Alan Duke, cofounder and editor in chief of fact-checking site Lead Stories, which started working with Meta in 2019. “No advance notice.”\nThe news that Meta was no longer planning on using their services was announced in a blog post by chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan on Tuesday morning and an accompanying video from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Instead, the company plans to rely on X-style Community Notes, which allow users to flag content that they think is inaccurate or requires further explanation.\nMeta partners with dozens of fact-checking organizations and newsrooms across the globe, 10 of which are based in the US, where Meta’s new rules will first be applied.\n“We were blindsided by this,” Jesse Stiller, the managing editor of Meta fact-checking partner Check Your Fact, tells WIRED. His organization started working with Meta in 2019, and it has 10 people working in the newsroom. “This was totally unexpected and out of left field for us. We weren't aware this decision was being considered until Mark dropped the video overnight.”\nThe news organizations who had partnered with Meta to tackle the spread of disinformation on the platform from 2016 are scrambling to figure out how this change will impact them.\n“We have no idea what the future looks like for the website going forward,” Stiller says.\nDuke says Lead Stories has a diverse revenue stream and most of its operations are outside of the US, but he claims the decision would still have an impact on them. “The most painful part of this is losing some very good, experienced journalists, who will no longer be paid to research false claims found on Meta platforms,” Duke says.\nFor others the financial implications are even more dire. One editor at a US-based fact-checking organization that works with Meta, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told WIRED that Meta’s decision “is going to eventually drain us out.”\nMeta did not respond to a request to comment on its partners’ allegations or the financial impact its decision would have on some organizations.\n\"Meta didn’t owe fact-checkers anything, but it knows that by pulling this partnership it’s removing a very significant source of funding for the ecosystem globally,” says Alexios Mantzarlis, who helped establish the first partnerships between fact-checkers and Facebook between 2015 and 2019 as director of the International Fact Checking Network.\nMeta’s partners were also angered by Zuckerberg’s allegation that fact-checkers had become too biased.\nAccording to Duke, it is disappointing to hear Mark Zuckerberg accuse the organizations in Meta's US third-party fact-checking program of being “too politically biased.” “Let me fact-check that. Lead Stories follows the highest standards of journalism and ethics required by the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles. We fact-check without regard to where on the political spectrum a false claim originates.”\nThis was a viewpoint reiterated by Kristin Roberts, the chief content officer at Gannett Media, whose publication USA Today was another Meta fact-checking partner.\n\"Fact-based journalism is what USA Today does best,” Roberts said in an emailed statement. “Truth and facts serve everyone—not the right or the left—and that's what we will continue to deliver.”\nMany of Meta’s fact-checking partners have claimed that Zuckerberg blaming fact-checkers for over-the-top censorship on the company’s platform was inaccurate, as they simply added information and context to posts, leaving the final decision to take down content to Meta itself.\n“To blame fact-checkers is a disappointing cop-out, and it perpetuates a misunderstanding of its own program,” says Neil Brown, the president of the Poynter Institute, which owns PolitiFact and the International Fact-Checking Network. “Facts are not censorship. Fact-checkers never censored anything. And Meta always held the cards. It's time to quit invoking inflammatory and false language in describing the role of journalists and fact-checking.”\nOther fact-checkers point out that the Community Notes model, which has in the past worked poorly at X, still requires the input of experts in order to work.\n“While a crowdsourced model for content verification may work in theory, it cannot magically succeed without relying on expertise, particularly on complex scientific and technical topics,” Emmanuel Vincent, the executive director of Science Feedback, a Meta fact-checking partner, tells WIRED. “Participants in such a program will still need to rely on credible evidence sourced from fact-checking organizations, trustworthy journalism, or scientists with relevant expertise to ensure accurate assessments.”\nZuckerberg, who mentions president-elect Donald Trump on a number of occasions in his video, has been trying to build closer links to the incoming administration in recent weeks.\nThe Meta CEO, who donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, was a recent visitor to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, bringing with him a pair of the company’s Ray-Ban AI glasses as a gift.\nZuckerberg’s decision last week to promote Kaplan, a former deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush, was widely seen as an effort to appease the incoming administration—as was Meta’s decision this week to appoint UFC CEO and close Trump ally Dana White, to its board.\nNow some of Meta’s fact-checking partners see the decision to abandon third-party fact-checkers and implement an X-style Community Notes model as another effort to appease Trump.\n“It’s unfortunate that this decision comes in the wake of extreme political pressure from a new administration and its supporters,” Angie Drobnic Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network, said in an emailed statement. “Fact-checkers have not been biased in their work—that attack line comes from those who feel they should be able to exaggerate and lie without rebuttal or contradiction.”\nAdditional reporting by Brian Barrett.",

    "content_text": "As head of one of the world’s only dedicated research labs focused on human metapneumovirus, John Williams used to spend most of his time attempting to convince skeptical doctors the virus was real. So when the recent outbreak in northern China was met with widespread alarm, Williams allowed himself a wry smile. The forgotten burden of public health was finally being taken seriously.\nHuman metapneumovirus, or hMPV, was first identified 24 years ago by a group of Dutch scientists seeking to better characterize viruses responsible for acute respiratory infections. But in the years since, wider awareness of hMPV has remained remarkably low, despite its being one of many endemic respiratory viruses that circulate globally on a seasonal basis, alongside influenza, Covid, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). “In North America or the southern hemisphere, it circulates during the winter months, and then during the rainy season in the tropics,” Williams says. “Typically, you see RSV first, then comes a big peak of flu and then a big peak of hMPV. The three sort of follow each other.”\nSten Vermund, chief medical officer of the Global Virus Network, an international coalition of medical virologists, says it’s important to clarify that hMPV is not going to drive a Covid- or flu-level pandemic. Being highly infectious, it is so common that almost all children have been infected by the age of 5, but in the majority of healthy children and adults, the virus merely presents as a mild cold. It also doesn’t mutate and evolve to the same extent as Covid and influenza, meaning that while our immunity levels periodically wax and wane, depending on the level of exposure to hMPV in recent years, our immune systems aren’t having to continually learn how to fight off wildly different new forms of the virus.\nWilliams’ hunch is that the recent spike of cases in China reflects the fact that the levels of child immunity in the country had dipped as a consequence of the Chinese government’s “Zero Covid” policies, which saw restrictions on social mixing implemented for almost three years to try to suppress SARS-CoV-2. “China maintained Covid prevention measures a lot longer than the rest of the world, and then when you open back up, you’re a bit more susceptible,” Williams says. “So it’s probably that, rather than there being a particularly virulent strain of hMPV around.”\nWhile hMPV levels in the US are currently low—accounting for less than 2 percent of weekly positive tests for respiratory viruses, based on the CDC’s latest data, compared to 19 percent for influenza and 7 percent for Covid—the country also experienced a sudden post-pandemic surge in hMPV infections during the winter of 2022–23.\nIn early 2023, Williams remembers receiving calls from surprised doctors around the country, describing hospitalized patients—mainly young children, over-75s, or immunocompromized individuals—who had tested positive for hMPV. But to Williams, this was not unexpected.\nA decade earlier, he had published a seminal paper in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, showing hMPV to be the second-most-common infection identified in hospitalized children after RSV. A previous New York study carried out over four years, and published in 2008, had also found hMPV to be as common a cause of hospitalization in older adults as RSV or flu, with similar rates of ICU admissions and death. Another national study of adults hospitalized with symptoms of pneumonia showed that hMPV seemed to be as common as RSV, and nearly as common as influenza.\nLike many other respiratory viruses, Williams says that hMPV tends to impact those with chronic lung diseases or existing conditions such as asthma and cancer. But despite this, he has found that many doctors are unaware that it’s a threat, largely because until relatively recently, no one was testing for it outside of academic studies.\n“There’s no question that even within the medical community, a lot of physicians are just not aware of how common hMPV is,” he says. “As clinical testing has become more available, I’ve had people say to me, with surprise, ‘I had a patient in my ICU with metapneumovirus last week. It’s real, and I never believed it before.’ Until people see it themselves, I think they don’t totally believe the burden.”\nVermund says that there have likely been many spikes of hMPV infections in the past, but we were either not aware of them or mistook them for influenza. He explains that one of the consequences of Covid has been a recognition of the need for greater surveillance of circulating respiratory viruses, meaning that hMPV case numbers are being detected by epidemiologists for the first time.\n“The Chinese have become quite advanced at molecular diagnostics for respiratory viruses and they’re doing a lot of public health surveillance, more than many other countries,” he says. “I think what we may be seeing is that they’re doing an especially good job at this, and so finding that metapneumovirus is more common than we used to realize.”\nWilliams believes that the current spike of interest in hMPV could have positive consequences for public health. Right now, he says that hMPV can only be detected as part of a so-called multiplex panel, a diagnostic that checks for the presence of up to 25 different respiratory viruses, at a cost of around $200 per patient. While this is a worthwhile investment for emergency room doctors deciding whether to admit a sick infant or send them home, such costs are often prohibitive for ordinary physicians.\n“There are cheap tests for flu, Covid, and RSV that can be used by clinicians anywhere,” he says. “But there’s not really any cheap test for hMPV, just this complex diagnostic panel which assesses multiple viruses and that’s hard for the average clinic to get hold of.”\nThere are hopes that low-cost testing for hMPV could be on the way. According to Vermund, the Ragon Institute in Massachusetts is working on ways of trying to reduce the price of respiratory virus testing to under $6 per patient, with the ultimate goal of driving the cost down to less than $1.\nEqually, another consequence of the increasing awareness surrounding hMPV is that it provides stronger incentives for fast-tracking a vaccine. As yet, no licensed vaccine is available for the virus, but a series of candidates have entered early-stage clinical trials in the last two years.\nLast summer, scientists at the University of Oxford launched a clinical trial of a combined RSV and hMPV vaccine in partnership with Moderna, and Andrew Pollard, a professor of infection and immunity who directs the Oxford Vaccine Group, says that adding hMPV to existing vaccines would be the most practical means of rolling out an additional immunization.\n“If you can put them in the same vaccine, so RSV and hMPV, then without needing extra needles, you’re actually covering more of the respiratory admissions to hospital,” says Pollard. “But before we can do that, we need to find out how often you need to vaccinate against hMPV. If you can provide immunity by vaccinating every few years, then you could combine with RSV.”\nOverall, Vermund describes the sudden interest in hMPV as an important development. While the virus won’t trigger the next pandemic, it still afflicts such a significant number of people that it’s a major drain on public health systems, as well as being a long-underrecognized cause of mortality in the vulnerable.\n“Even though metapneumovirus is not one of the more lethal viruses, it’s incredibly common,” he says. “It’s been causing a nontrivial amount of colds over the years, which is an incredible economic burden, and every once in a while, it kills somebody.”",

    "content_text": "Laptop screens can feel cramped. But what if you could magically get more real estate without having to carry around a portable monitor? That's precisely the purpose of Lenovo's ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable AI PC—yes, rollable. It has an OLED display that, with the push of a button, extends the 14-inch screen upward to make for an awkward aspect ratio, but roughly doubles the screen space to 16.7 inches. Two screens are better than one for productivity, but what if one screen could be two but still one? Yes.\nIt plays a fun animation and some music when it does its rolling thing. You can also activate the rolling action with a palm gesture; once it scans your palm, shift it up or down to raise or lower the screen. (Pressing the button on the keyboard is way faster.) You can take advantage of Windows 11 window snapping features to put apps one on top of the other. I stacked two browser windows, but you can put other apps below too. Considering I'm already that guy who brings a spare portable monitor everywhere, this just seems like a more elegant solution that takes up less space in my bag. And of course, anyone can take advantage of the long aspect ratio to get a better look at documents, PDFs, and web pages.\nLenovo says it has tested the rolling function 30,000 times, and it has performed without flaws, so you can rest a little easier about reliability, though repairing this machine sounds like it will be a task. The whole laptop doesn't feel significantly different from a normal machine, weighing just 3.7 pounds—that's 1 pound less than the 16-inch MacBook Pro. However, walking with your laptop open in your hand might be weird, as it feels a little top heavy. When closed, it's 19.9 mm thin—the 16-inch MacBook Pro is 15.4 mm, so Lenovo's machine is thicker, but not as thick as a gaming laptop.\nLenovo often shows off quirky concepts at trade shows—last year we got a glimpse of a transparent laptop at Mobile World Congress. But, announced at CES 2025, this rollable PC is no concept. This is a real laptop the company will begin shipping in the first quarter of 2025 with a staggering $3,499 price tag. Powered by Intel's Core Ultra 7 Series 2 processor, this is a Copilot+ PC, with up to 32 GB of RAM and up to 1 TB of storage.\nThe First Third-Party SteamOS Handheld\nHandheld gaming consoles that aren't the Nintendo Switch have been getting popular over the last two years, kicked off largely in part to the debut of Valve's Steam Deck. That console employs SteamOS as the operating system, but subsequent competitors use Windows as the OS, which can lead to a janky experience. Windows just wasn't designed to be used on a handheld gaming console, though things could change as Microsoft is rumored to be working on an Xbox handheld.\nBut if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em. That's what Lenovo did with the Legion Go S. This isn't a successor to the Legion Go—the company unveiled a prototype Legion Go 2 with some small refinements—but it's an alternate version that comes in two flavors: Windows or SteamOS. That makes it the first licensed handheld gaming console running SteamOS. Unfortunately, there's no dual-booting option; you have to choose which operating system you want at checkout, though you are able to run third-party game stores on SteamOS, like the Epic Games Store.\nWith SteamOS, you can take advantage of cloud saves, so you can stop playing at your desktop PC or laptop and move to the Legion Go S without losing progress. You can also stream games from your PC to the console if they're more graphically demanding (as long as your internet connection is good).\nOutside of software, the Legion Go S variants have the same hardware. They're powered by AMD's Ryzen Z2 Go or Ryzen Z1 Extreme, sport an 8-inch 1,920 X 1,200-pixel resolution LCD display with a 120-Hz variable refresh rate. The screen is smaller and lower-res than on the original Legion Go, which affords better battery life, though it also helps that the battery is beefier at 55.5 watt-hours. It does not feature removable controllers, though you can use the two USB-C ports to hook it up to a monitor for a desktop-like experience, and there's a microSD card slot to expand storage.\nThe Windows-powered Legion Go S starts at $730 and arrives this month, though there will be other configurations with newer chipsets coming later in May, with prices starting at $600. The SteamOS version starts at $500 and launches in May.\nMonitor Speakers With Private Audio\nLenovo has dozens of new CES products, but one last gizmo that stood out to me is the ThinkCentre M90a Pro Gen 6 all-in-one computer. It doesn't sound all that exciting (all-in-ones rarely are), but Lenovo has new technology called “Lenovo Focus Sound” injected into this machine. This is almost like a film applied over the display that delivers audio specifically to you—using a machine-learning algorithm and the built-in camera, it makes sure only you can hear audio from the monitor, so nearby coworkers can't hear that you're secretly catching up on Love Island.\nIt sounds bizarre—almost like someone is whispering in your ear—but it works! I stood directly in front of the computer and listened to a demo reel, and the people next to me couldn't hear a thing. I moved a little to the right, and the sound disappeared. It seems helpful for office environments, but then again, headphones already exist. Still, the technology is very cool, even if it sounds a little unsettling. The M90a Pro Gen 6 goes on sale this quarter and starts at $2,539.",

    "content_text": "Meta announced Tuesday that it is abandoning its third-party fact-checking programs on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads and replacing its army of paid moderators with a Community Notes model that mimics X’s much-maligned volunteer program, which allows users to publicly flag content they believe to be incorrect or misleading.\nIn a blog post announcing the news, Meta’s newly appointed chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, said the decision was taken to allow more topics to be openly discussed on the company’s platforms. The change will first impact the company’s moderation in the US.\n“We will allow more speech by lifting restrictions on some topics that are part of mainstream discourse and focusing our enforcement on illegal and high-severity violations,” Kaplan said, though he did not detail what topics these new rules would cover.\nIn a video accompanying the blog post, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the new policies would see more political content returning to people’s feeds as well as posts on other issues that have inflamed the culture wars in the US in recent years.\n“We're going to simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse,” Zuckerberg said.\nMeta has significantly rolled back fact-checking and decided to get rid of the content moderation policies it had put in place in the wake of revelations in 2016 about influence operations conducted on its platforms, which were designed to sway elections and in some case promote violence and even genocide.\nAhead of last year’s high-profile elections across the globe, Meta was criticized for taking a hands-off approach to content moderation related to those votes.\nEchoing comments Zuckerberg made last year, Kaplan said that Meta’s content moderation policies had been put in place not to protect users but “partly in response to societal and political pressure to moderate content.”\nKaplan also blasted fact-checking experts for their “biases and perspectives” which led to over-moderation: “Over time we ended up with too much content being fact-checked that people would understand to be legitimate political speech and debate,” Kaplan wrote.\nWIRED reported last year, however, that dangerous content like medical misinformation has flourished on the platform while groups like anti-government militias have utilized Facebook to recruit new members.\nZuckerberg meanwhile blamed the “legacy media” for forcing Facebook to implement content moderation policies in the wake of the 2016 election. “After Trump first got elected in 2016 the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy,” Zuckerberg said. “We tried, in good faith, to address those concerns without becoming arbiters of truth, but the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created.”\nMeta’s decision could have a direct negative impact on media organizations in the US who partner with the company for fact-checking, including Reuters and USA Today. Meta's fact-checking partners did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nFacebook has already contributed to the demise of journalism and this will be the final nail in the coffin,” Nina Jankowicz, the former Biden administration disinformation czar who is now CEO of the American Sunlight Project, said in an emailed statement. “Newsrooms get grants from Facebook to provide fact-checks. That money allows them to do other journalism. Zuckerberg’s announcement is a full bending of the knee to Trump and an attempt to catch up to Musk in his race to the bottom. Fact-checking was not a panacea to disinformation on Facebook but it was an important part of moderation.”\nIn what he attempted to frame as a bid to remove bias, Zuckerberg said Meta’s in-house trust and safety team would be moving from California to Texas, which is also now home to X’s headquarters. “As we work to promote free expression, I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams,” Zuckerberg said.\nX alternative BlueSky announced in August last year that it was also considering introducing a Community Notes–style feature to specifically address the issue of “dog-piling and other forms of harassment.” The feature has yet to be introduced.\nLike X, the Meta approach will utilize an army of volunteers who will write community notes on posts, but in order for those posts to be visible to all users, other volunteers will need to vote to approve the note. “Just like they do on X, Community Notes will require agreement between people with a range of perspectives to help prevent biased ratings,” Kaplan wrote.\n\"We’ve seen this approach work on X—where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see,” Kaplan wrote.\nBut Community Notes on X, first introduced as BirdWatch in 2021, has been shown repeatedly to not only fail to stem the tide of disinformation and hate speech that has come to dominate the platform, but is in fact adding to the problem.\nZuckerberg, who recently visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago and brought the president-elect a pair of the company’s new AR glasses, also slammed lawmakers in Europe and Latin America for overzealous censorship and stifling free speech.\n“We're going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more,” Zuckerberg said.\nBut critics of Zuckerberg and Meta were quick to slam these policy changes. “Meta’s announcement today is a retreat from any sane and safe approach to content moderation,” the Real Facebook Oversight Board, an activist group established in response to the establishment of Meta's own oversight board, said in a statement.\n“Censorship is a manufactured crisis, political pandering to signal that Meta’s platforms are open for business to far-right propaganda. Twitter’s shift from fact-checking has turned the platform into a cesspool; Zuckerberg is joining them in a race to the bottom.”",

    "content_text": "Last January at CES, Microsoft chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi declared 2024 the “year of the AI PC.” And whether you believe that prediction came true or not—many new PCs come with AI-accelerating neural processing units onboard, but far from all of them—you can't deny that Microsoft did try very hard to make it happen.\nThis year, Mehdi is back with another prediction: 2025 will be “the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh.” This year is also, not coincidentally, the year that most Windows 10 PCs will stop receiving new security updates.\nMehdi's post includes few, if any, new announcements, but it does set the tone for how Microsoft is handling the sunsetting of Windows 10, attempting to strike a balance between carrot and stick. The carrots include Windows 11's new features (both AI and otherwise) and the performance, security, and battery life benefits inherent to brand-new PC hardware. The stick is that Windows 10 support ends in October 2025, and Microsoft is not interested in extending that date for the general public or in expanding official Windows 11 support to older PCs.\n“Whether the current PC needs a refresh, or it has security vulnerabilities that require the latest hardware-backed protection, now is the time to move forward with a new Windows 11 PC,” Mehdi writes.\nMicrosoft and its partners obviously benefit more from users buying new PCs than they do when Microsoft provides free OS updates for existing machines. It's also true that many formally unsupported PCs can run Windows 11 just fine, especially with carefully considered hardware upgrades.\nBut it's also the case that many users of older, incompatible PCs could benefit a lot from an upgrade at this point. When Microsoft announced and released the first version of Windows 11 in 2021, it restricted support to PCs and processors that were, at the time, no more than three or four years old. By the time October rolls around, those machines will be seven or eight years old. PCs that can't run Windows 11 will be nearly a decade old or older. In that time, CPUs and GPUs have gotten faster, laptop screens have gotten larger and better, and old hardware has had plenty of time to deplete its battery and suffer from physical wear and tear.\nA Limited-Time Escape Hatch\nMehdi declined to mention that Windows 10 users who want to stay Windows 10 users do have an escape hatch. The company's Extended Security Update (ESU) program for Windows 10 will allow users and businesses to keep getting updates for at least one year after October 2025; end users can only get one year of extra updates for their home PCs, but organizations can get as many as three extra years. The caveat is that you'll need to pay for the privilege: $30 for one year of updates if you're an individual and between $1 and $61 per user for schools and businesses, with costs that escalate significantly for the second and third years.\nWindows 10 still accounts for between one-half and two-thirds of all Windows usage worldwide and in the US, according to admittedly noisy data from sources like Statcounter and the Steam Hardware Survey. Leaving that many Windows PCs potentially unprotected from security threats has the potential to cause big problems, which probably at least partially explains why Microsoft would really like to see lots of upgrades this year. But even if 2025 does become “the year of the Windows 11 PC refresh,” it's hard to see how it could possibly happen fast enough to get most of those Windows 10 PCs out of circulation.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "When news broke in late November that Swedish electric battery maker Northvolt had collapsed, it signaled a grim outlook for clean mobility in Europe. The startup was once hailed as the continent’s best hope for producing affordable batteries on home soil, instead of relying on Chinese imports. Experts and some industry figures are now expressing doubt as to whether it will ever be possible for Europe’s carmakers to produce electric vehicles self-sufficiently.\nThe European Union has set carmakers a 2035 deadline to end sales of new petrol combustion engine cars on the continent. In the UK, the Labour Party government recently brought this deadline forward to 2030.\nThe continent’s rich carmaking heritage, coupled with these defined environmental targets, could in theory create a strong foundation for European manufacturers to lead the way in the global switch to electric mobility. Unfortunately, that’s not what’s happening.\nEurope’s car giants have so far consistently failed to keep up with their Chinese counterparts when it comes to producing affordable and efficient EVs—models such as the BYD Seagull sell for as little as $10,000 in China, whereas the average price of a new electric car in Germany is €52,700—and take-up of the vehicles on Europe’s roads has been slow. Now, questions are arising as to whether Europe’s 2035 deadline will be met. Carmakers including BMW, VW and Renault, as well as the Italian government, have all recently called on the EU to revise or delay its targets.\nIn 2023 around 50 percent of the world’s electric cars were on China’s roads, according to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based autonomous organization that represents more than two dozen countries. In Europe, plug-in vehicles are still struggling to gain momentum. Overall sales are down 1.7 percent this year after European governments withdrew a number of subsidies and incentives. There are several reasons for this discrepancy.\nFirstly, Chinese manufacturers have been adept at producing low-cost EVs whereas their European counterparts have largely focused on the high-end market, in keeping with their wider business models.\nChinese companies do not have the same combustion engine legacy, said Carl-Friedrich Elmer from Agora Verkehrswende, a German think-tank focused on the shift to clean transportation. “They could start from scratch and focus all their energy [on EVs], without being distracted by further developing their combustion engine businesses.”\nChina’s expansive electronics industry also gave manufacturers a head start in battery technology know-how, he claims. As early as 2002, the Chinese government recognised that investing in electric mobility could give them a global advantage, as well as providing a solution for the relentless smog hanging over the country’s cities. The government poured subsidies into the industry, with some pure EV startups quickly becoming household names. Chinese companies also switched to lithium iron phosphate batteries, known as LFP batteries, which are safer and cheaper—although slightly lower energy density—than the lithium nickel manganese cobalt batteries preferred by Western companies. The country struck multiple international deals guaranteeing companies access to a steady supply of raw materials needed for battery production.\nWith European EV sales and production lagging behind in comparison, a blame game has arisen between car manufacturers and policymakers. “A regulatory framework that ignores customer needs and market realities—and at the same time, is incapable of creating the necessary conditions for alternative technologies—cannot succeed,” a BMW spokesperson said in a written statement to WIRED, explaining that the company is opposed to the 2035 ban. It added that unless “charging infrastructure, availability of renewable energies and access to raw materials” are addressed, the ban will cause the “entire vehicle market” to contract.\nGiven that the car industry employs 13.8 million people across Europe and represents around 7 percent of the continent’s GDP, such a contraction would be economically disastrous.\nLow car sales have already prompted Volkswagen to announce plans to shutter at least three factories, sparking anxiety in Germany over the country’s economic outlook. The far-right political party Alternative for Germany, which is currently second in the polls ahead of Germany’s snap general elections in February 2025, doesn’t support a combustion engine ban and has made the perceived economic cost of environmental policies a key part of its messaging.\n“Let’s put it bluntly—consumers just don’t believe in e-mobility,” says Beatrix Keim, director of CAR Center for Automotive Research. “The vehicles are perceived as too expensive, people are worried about battery safety, and are also concerned about charging costs.” She believes both politicians and the industry have a role to play in changing this, both through subsidies and investments in infrastructure such as charging solutions, and also through creating cheaper vehicles. “It could be tactical pricing, discounts, rebates, or just cut the prices throughout—which of course needs to be balanced with financial profits,” she says. “But overall, they [both] need to make the public understand e-mobility better and clear up some of the myths, such as battery safety.”\nIn an attempt to keep their factories and technologies alive, some European carmakers have floated the idea of “clean” fuels as a means to carry on selling combustion engine cars past the 2035 deadline. Germany has been at the forefront of this, successfully campaigning in 2023 for vehicles that run on “e-fuels” to be made exempt from the ban. E-fuels, which are still in the research and development stage, are made from combining hydrogen and carbon dioxide and, according to their proponents, release significantly less emissions than gasoline.\nHowever, not all industry experts are convinced. “E-fuels are complete nonsense,” claims Peter Mock, Europe managing director of the International Council on Clean Transport. “The efficiency of those fuels is terrible, which means the prices are very high—and they will stay high.” On top of this, he believes talk of alternative fuels is confusing for consumers—which could further harm EV sales. “EVs are simply the most efficient, the cheapest and the most convenient means of transport, and we need to communicate that,” he claims.\nOf course, the 2035 ban will only apply to the countries of the European Union, while the continent’s carmakers will continue to sell globally. One solution could be a pivot to US markets, where predictions for EV sales throughout the Trump presidency are already being slashed.\n“[European carmakers] already have plants there and they could easily expand them,” says Keim. “But then, they would also need to hire more people in the US.” She is doubtful as to whether Trump’s proposed migration policies would allow carmakers to source enough workers.\nAll experts who spoke to WIRED stressed they are still optimistic that the 2035 deadline will be met. Muck is hopeful that Volkswagen’s ID.1 and ID.2 cars, due on the market in the next few years, will crack the code for cheaper EV production.\nHowever, in Germany, the heart of European carmaking, debate is rumbling on as to whether the 2035 phase-out deadline should be pushed back, or if the penalties for missing it—which could run into the billions—should be lowered. In the face of recent farmers protests, EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen agreed to scrap the bloc’s plans to halve use of pesticides, raising questions as to how rigidly she will stick to other agreed environmental targets if the car industry stages similar protests.\nKeim is adamant that a later date would be disastrous. “It would send completely the wrong message to consumers,” she said. “These targets have been known for long enough.” Muck compared the coming shift to electric vehicles as akin to the move to smartphones 15 years ago: “At some point the better technologies will succeed, and you cannot prevent that.”",

    "content_text": "On Friday, U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy suggested a major change in how America labels alcoholic drinks: booze should come with cigarette-style warnings, given that alcohol is a leading preventable cause of cancer, similar to the labeling Ireland is rolling out later this year. This has intensified focus on alcohol ahead of the scheduled update to the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans later this year, but it’s not clear if new labels should be expected—adding them would require action from Congress.\nDrinkers, though, are already taking their own action. If the bars look a bit emptier this month, it may be because more people are trading happy hour for Dry January. The tradition, in which people abstain from alcohol for the entire month, is growing in popularity.\nAccording to data from the polling organization CivicScience, one in four US adults completed Dry January in 2024, up from 16 percent the year before. And an estimated 15.5 million people in the UK, where the movement originated 12 years ago, said they planned to participate this year, according to Alcohol Change UK, the charity behind the movement. In 2013, that number was just 4,000. Temporary sobriety is contagious, and studies show that pushing away the bottle for a month does have immediate health benefits. But whether the health benefits last—or reach those most in need—remains unclear.\n“This concept, that it’s a one-month detox or spring clean that gets you ready for the rest of the year, I don’t think there’s any evidence for that,” says Gautam Mehta, an associate professor in hepatology at University College London who has studied the effects of month-long sobriety. “But people do seem to get more of an understanding with their own relationship with alcohol and what they want to do with their relationship with drinking for the rest of the year.”\nA 2018 study Mehta worked on followed a group of moderate drinkers who went sober for a month and compared them to a control group that kept up their old habits. The most noticeable benefits for the nondrinkers included better sleep and weight loss. They also experienced more subtle effects; their blood pressure fell and their biomarkers for insulin resistance improved, an indicator of decreased risk for developing diabetes.\nAnd some people say a sober month does help them to cut back overall. In 2019, University of Sussex researchers analyzed a survey filled out by several thousand people. They found that 59 percent of respondents reported drinking less six months after Dry January, and 32 percent said they were in better physical health. However, only about 38 percent of people who began the survey followed up at the six-month mark.\nStill, taking only a short break doesn’t necessarily give the body time to fully recover from the effects of drinking. That’s what two British doctors, who are also identical twins, showed when they carried out their own experiment in 2015. (Mehta provided expertise in the experiment, which aired as an episode of BBC’s Horizon.) They each spent one month sober, and tests showed they had identical healthy livers. Then, they spent a month drinking 21 units of alcohol weekly, the recommended limit for men in the UK at the time (it has since been revised down to 14 units). There was a difference in how they got the job done: One drank three units (about one large glass of wine) every day for a month, and the other drank only once a week, but binged all 21 units. At the end of the month, both had increased liver inflammation. For the binging twin, it was clear that even taking six days off between binges wasn’t enough time for the organ to fully heal.\nShort periods of abstinence also won’t prevent drinkers from increasing their cancer risk. For at least four cancers—mouth, upper throat and voicebox, oesophageal, and breast—any consumption of alcohol raises the risk, though keeping to recommended limits can keep the risk of these cancers low, says Alcohol Change UK. And participating in Dry January can help people work towards this. Another study from the University of Sussex researchers found that just 11 percent of people who tried Dry January had a rebound in drinking and consumed more alcohol than they did before. However, those who failed to complete the full month were more likely to drink more afterward than those who made it through the 31 days.\nDry January may be successful because it’s a challenge posed to moderate drinkers—those who drink heavily could experience withdrawal if they decide to suddenly stop without professional supervision. And its participants are self-selecting; they engage with the movement because they want to limit alcohol or rework their relationship with it. If they feel the benefits, they may be more likely to keep cutting back while now having the skills to turn down alcohol. “People who are actually at the least risk are the best catered to with Dry January and other campaigns, whereas people who really do have a problem seem to be missing out in terms of attention and resources,” says Ian Hamilton, an honorary fellow in addiction at the University of York.\nOverall, drinking habits are waning, thanks in part to the rise of non-alcoholic adult beverages. Polling from Gallup has found that the average number of alcoholic drinks Americans consume each week has slowly fallen since the turn of the century. Averages, though, can conceal how behaviors vary across the population, since many people don’t drink at all, and a small percentage of people consume heavily, reaching more than 10 drinks a day.\nHamilton says there should be more long-term research on Dry January’s effects—and that would mean following participants for six months to a year. With millions of people taking part, there’s still much to learn about how significant the benefits are and how long they last for different groups, based on how much people drink and their diet and exercise choices.\nOne thing is clear: Putting alcohol on hold for 31 days and then coming back to the bar for rounds of shots isn’t life-changing. But what people learn about themselves and how drinking affects them physically could be. “Some people unfortunately view Dry January as the job done,” Hamilton says. “I’d rather exchange Dry January for people doing a more regular period of abstinence.”",

    "content_text": "Sam Berns was my friend. With the wisdom of a sage, he inspired me and many others about how to make the most of life. Afflicted with the rare disease called progeria, his body aged at a rapid rate, and he died of heart failure at just 17, a brave life cut much too short.\nMy lab discovered the genetic cause of Sam’s illness two decades ago: Just one DNA letter gone awry, a T that should have been a C in a critical gene called lamin A. The same misspelling is found in almost all of the 200 individuals around the world with progeria.\nThe opportunity to address this illness by directly fixing the misspelling in the relevant body tissues was just science fiction a few years ago. Then Crispr came along—the elegant enzymatic apparatus that allows delivery of DNA scissors to a specific target in the genome. In December 2023, the FDA approved the first Crispr-based therapy for sickle cell disease. That approach required taking bone marrow cells out of the body, making a disabling cut in a particular gene that regulates fetal hemoglobin, treating the patient with chemotherapy to make room in the marrow, and then reinfusing the edited cells. A relief from lifelong anemia and excruciating attacks of pain is now being delivered to sickle cell patients, albeit at very high cost.\nFor progeria and thousands of other genetic diseases, there are two reasons why this same approach won’t work. First, the desired edit for most misspellings will not usually be achieved by a disabling cut in the gene. Instead, a correction is needed. In the case of progeria, the disease-causing T needs to be edited back to a C. By analogy with a word processor, what’s needed is not “find and delete” (first-generation Crispr), it’s “find and replace” (next-generation Crispr). Second, the misspelling needs to be repaired in the parts of the body that are most harmed by the disease. While bone marrow cells, immune cells, and skin cells can be taken out of the body to administer gene therapy, that won’t work when the main problem is in the cardiovascular system (as in progeria) or the brain (as in many rare genetic diseases). In the lingo of the gene therapist, we need in vivo options.\nThe exciting news in 2025 is that both of these barriers are starting to come down. The next generation of Crispr-based gene editors, pioneered particularly elegantly by David Liu of the Broad Institute, allows precise corrective editing of virtually any gene misspelling, without inducing a scissors cut. As for delivery systems, the family of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors already provides the ability to achieve in vivo editing in eye, liver, and muscle, though there is still much work to be done to optimize delivery to other tissues and ensure safety. Nonviral delivery systems such as lipid nanoparticles are under intense development and may displace viral vectors in a few years.\nWorking with David Liu, Sam Berns’ mom, and Leslie Gordon of the Progeria Research Foundation, my research group has already shown that a single intravenous infusion of an in vivo gene editor can dramatically extend the life of mice that have been engineered to carry the human progeria mutation. Our team is now working to bring this forward to a human clinical trial. We are truly excited about the potential for kids with progeria, but that excitement could have even greater impact. This strategy, if successful, could be a model for the approximately 7,000 genetic diseases where the specific misspelling that causes the disease is known, but no therapy exists.\nThere are many hurdles, cost being a major one as private investment is absent for diseases that affect only a few hundred individuals. However, success for a few rare diseases, supported by government and philanthropic funds, will likely lead to efficiencies and economies that will help with other future applications. This is the best hope for the tens of millions of children and adults who are waiting for a cure. The rare-disease community must press on. That’s what Sam Berns would have wanted.",

Pound-for-pound, methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the first two decades after release. Over the past two centuries, its concentration has more than doubled, a much faster increase than for carbon dioxide. Methane concentrations are rising more quickly than at any time since record-keeping began.\nGlobal methane emissions are also dominated by human activities to an extent far greater than for carbon dioxide. More than 60 percent of global methane emissions come from human activity: extracting fossil fuels; raising cows that burp (not fart); dumping trash in our landfills and waste treatment sites.\nThe good news is that a tiny fraction of sites are responsible for much of that pollution. Emissions of methane are dominated by so-called super-emitters: 5 percent of facilities yield more than half of all methane emissions in a given oil and gas field or industry. Quench those emissions and we’ll dent global methane pollution substantially.\nMethaneSAT and Carbon Mapper circle the Earth north-south in a polar orbit.

    "content_text": "Nvidia already sells boatloads of computer chips to every major company building proprietary artificial intelligence models. But now, at a moment when public interest in open source and do-it-yourself AI is soaring, the company announced it will also begin offering a “personal AI supercomputer” later this year, starting at $3,000, that anyone can use in their own home or office.\nNvidia’s new desktop machine, dubbed Digits, will go on sale in May and is about the size of a small book. It contains an Nvidia “superchip” called GB10 Grace Blackwell, optimized to accelerate the computations needed to train and run AI models, and comes equipped with 128 gigabytes of unified memory and up to 4 terabytes of NVMe storage for handling especially large AI programs.\nJensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, announced the new system, along with several other AI offerings, during a keynote speech today at CES, an annual confab for the computer industry held in Las Vegas. (You can check out all of the biggest announcements on the WIRED CES live blog.)\n“Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher, and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,” Huang said in a statement released ahead of his keynote.\nNvidia says the Digits machine, which stands for \"deep learning GPU intelligence training system,\" will be able to run a single large language model with up to 200 billion parameters, a rough measure of a model’s complexity and size. To do this today, you would need to rent space from a cloud provider like AWS or Microsoft, or build a custom system with a handful of chips designed for running AI. If two Digits machines are connected using a proprietary high-speed interconnect link, Nvidia says they will be able to run the most capable version available of Meta’s open source Llama model, which has 405 billion parameters.\nDigits will make it easier for hobbyists and researchers to experiment with models that come close to the basic capabilities of OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Google’s Gemini in their offices or basements. But the best versions of those proprietary models, housed inside giant data centers owned by Microsoft and Google, are most likely larger as well as more powerful than anything Digits could handle.\nNvidia has been one of the largest beneficiaries of the AI boom. Its stock price skyrocketed over the past few years as tech companies clamored to buy vast quantities of the advanced hardware chips it produces, a crucial ingredient for developing cutting-edge AI. The company has proven adept at making hardware and software optimized for AI, and its product road map has become an important signal of where the industry is expected to head next.\nWhen it’s released, Digits will be the most powerful consumer computing hardware Nvidia offers. It already sells a range of chipsets for AI development known as Jetson that start at roughly $250. These can run smaller AI models and either be used like a mini desktop computer or installed on a robot to test different AI programs.\nBesides the new desktop system, Nvidia said today that it will soon be releasing several software tools for building and connecting so-called AI agents—programs that use large language models to perform useful tasks autonomously on behalf of people. This includes several custom versions of Llama called Nemotron that are fine-tuned and optimized for following instructions and planning actions in order to carry out agentic tasks. Agents have become the latest hot trend in AI, and many companies view them as a way to incorporate the technology into their operations to boost efficiency and save money.\n“Agentic AI is the next frontier of AI development, and delivering on this opportunity requires full-stack optimization across a system of LLMs to deliver efficient, accurate AI agents,” Ahmad Al-Dahle, vice president and head of GenAI at Meta, said in a statement.\nJensen said during his CES keynote that Nvidia expects companies to build and maintain AI agents using its technology. “In a lot of ways the IT department of every company is going to be the HR department of AI agents in the future,” the CEO said. “In the future they will maintain, nurture, on-board, and improve a whole bunch of AI agents.”",

But now, at a moment when public interest in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-myth-of-open-source-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open source</a> and do-it-yourself AI is soaring, the company announced it will also begin offering a “personal AI supercomputer” later this year, starting at $3,000, that anyone can use in their own home or office.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Nvidia’s new desktop machine, dubbed Digits, will go on sale in May and is about the size of a small book. It contains an Nvidia “superchip” called GB10 Grace Blackwell, optimized to accelerate the computations needed to train and run AI models, and comes equipped with 128 gigabytes of unified memory and up to 4 terabytes of NVMe storage for handling especially large AI programs.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, announced the new system, along with several other AI offerings, during a keynote speech today at <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/ces/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CES</a>, an annual confab for the computer industry held in Las Vegas. (You can check out all of the biggest announcements on the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/live/ces-2025-liveblog-1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WIRED CES live blog</a>.)</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">“Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher, and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI,” Huang said in a statement released ahead of his keynote.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">Nvidia says the Digits machine, which stands for \"deep learning GPU intelligence training system,\" will be able to run a single large language model with up to 200 billion parameters, a rough measure of a model’s complexity and size. To do this today, you would need to rent space from a cloud provider like AWS or Microsoft, or build a custom system with a handful of chips designed for running AI. If two Digits machines are connected using a proprietary high-speed interconnect link, Nvidia says they will be able to run the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-releases-new-llama-model-ai-voice/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">most capable</a> version available of Meta’s open source Llama model, which has 405 billion parameters.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Digits will make it easier for hobbyists and researchers to experiment with models that come close to the basic capabilities of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-4o-model-gives-chatgpt-a-snappy-flirty-upgrade/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI’s GPT-4</a> or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/google-gemini/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s Gemini</a> in their offices or basements. But the best versions of those proprietary models, housed inside giant data centers owned by Microsoft and Google, are most likely larger as well as more powerful than anything Digits could handle.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Nvidia has been one of the largest beneficiaries of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/nvidia-hardware-is-eating-the-world-jensen-huang/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI boom</a>. Its stock price skyrocketed over the past few years as tech companies clamored to buy vast quantities of the advanced hardware chips it produces, a crucial ingredient for developing cutting-edge AI. The company has proven adept at making hardware and software optimized for AI, and its product road map has become an important signal of where the industry is expected to head next.</p><p class=\"paywall\">When it’s released, Digits will be the most powerful consumer computing hardware Nvidia offers. It already sells a range of chipsets for AI development known as Jetson that start at roughly $250. These can run smaller AI models and either be used like a mini desktop computer or installed on a robot to test different AI programs.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe list of things that robot vacuums can do right now continues to grow. They can make an accurate map of your home so they don't bump into things. They can empty themselves and recharge themselves. They can reach under your couch to clean up crud. Many have dual mopping-vacuuming functionalities to wipe up your dog’s muddy footprints.\nOne thing most robot vacuums cannot currently do is pick stuff up off your floor. Running a robot vacuum can save you a lot of time and energy, but it often requires spending 10 to 20 minutes frantically running around trying to defuse robovac booby traps by moving or picking up cables, shoelaces, and stray hair ties.\nThis year, Roborock won the race to launch a commercial robot vacuum that has an extendable arm that can pick up small bits of clutter in its way, thus becoming the robot butler of your dreams. The Roborock Saros Z70 has this extendable arm with grasping pincers that the company calls the Omnigrip. I screamed when I saw it.\nSpin Me Right Round\nIn my testing, a robot vacuum is only as useful as its navigation system is accurate; all the suction power in the world won’t help you if it can’t find its way out from under your couch. I’ve found Roborock’s navigation systems to be consistently pretty accurate. The Saros Z70 uses a combination of sensors for navigation. There's an array of 3D Time-of-Flight sensors to measure the distances between objects, and AI-powered RGB cameras to identify obstacles and to decide when to deploy Omnigrip. (The arm stays folded and stowed in a small bay on top of the vacuum when it's not in use.)\nOmnigrip has five separate axes, so it can twist and turn itself both horizontally and vertically to grip items delicately in its tiny pincer grips. Right now, it can pick up anything that’s under 300 grams, or slightly less than a pound—so, items like tissues, socks, or even a sandal.\nTo use Omnigrip, Roborock customers activate it through the app. When the Saros Z70 moves through your house, it identifies potential objects that it can lift while it’s cleaning, and then circles back around to pick them up and put them away when it’s done. In the app, you can choose the areas in your home where Omnigrip operates, how it should behave, and where it should place things it picks up.\nBecause it’s a little freaky to be napping on the couch as a robot vacuum extends its arm out to pick up tissues from around the floor, the vacuum also includes both a child lock and a safety stop button to immediately turn it off should things go awry.\nAs with its previous iterations, Roborock reported that the robot vacuum is certified according to the TÜV Rheinland privacy and security standards, which means that a third-party organization evaluated the robot vacuum’s security protocols to ensure that pictures of your home or your body won’t end up hacked and on the internet. No images are stored in the cloud.\nAmong other features, the vacuum can also be sold with the multifunctional cleaning, mopping, and self-emptying dock, and the onboard RGB cameras mean that it can function as a pet camera to take video of your pets. (Roborock representatives told me that you would soon be able to use the Saros Z70 and its retractable arm to play with your pets when you aren’t at home.) It will be compatible with the Matter 1.4 protocol, which makes it more interoperable with the other smart home devices in your house. (It’s already compatible with Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri Shortcuts, and Google Home.)\nI Get Around\nRoborock gave WIRED a demonstration of the Saros Z70 before CES, which was a little anticlimactic given that I had talked myself into a breathless hype beforehand. The Saros Z70 doesn’t currently bustle around your house, tying your ties and muttering helpfully like a maid or a butler. Instead, during my demo, the Omnigrip took several minutes to consider whether to pick up a single dirty, gray sock.\nStill, that’s way better than getting the sock stuck in its roller brush and leaving an alert on my phone while I’m out grocery shopping.\nThe Roborock Saros Z70 isn’t the only disturbingly capable robot vacuum we’re expecting this year. Samsung’s Jet Bot Combo AI robot vacuum can detect intruders; if it sees suspicious activity during its scheduled cleaning sessions when it knows you’re not in the house, it will send you a push notification. Samsung representatives told me that the company is currently working on a feature where if another Samsung connected appliance, like an oven or a washing machine, detects suspicious activity, it can send the robot vacuum (and its camera) to go check it out.\nDreame debuted a prototype of a stair-climbing vacuum at IFA last year, showing a robot vacuum with a mobile arm on the bottom that extends to hoist the machine up ledges as high as 6 centimeters. (Very few stairs are that short; however, this is a great deal higher than the other robovac with a chassis-lifting mechanism, the Roborock QRevo Curv, can manage.) The the first Dreame vacuum with this tech, the X50 Ultra, is already available for preorder today with an official launch in February.\nWe’re also expecting to see other stair-climbing robots in the coming days, meaning that a robot vacuum will soon be able to traverse your house from floor to floor. Don't need a robot that can creep up and down your floors automatically? You can control this year’s new Switchbot K20+ Pro like a remote control car.\nIt sounds convenient to have an AI-enabled bot with built-in cameras that can move independently around your house. And it is, but it can also be a bit distressing. Suppose you’re at home playing Scrabble with your kids, and the robot vacuum suddenly emerges from its docking station and turns its camera toward you. Is that your husband checking in? Someone else? Imagine lying in bed, trying to relax with a good book about DAOs and NFTs and suddenly hearing your robot vacuum grindingly humping its way up the stairs to where you sleep. It’s enough to make you want to shut the vacuum up in a closet forever.\nOr maybe you can just acknowledge that the home is an incredibly complex and dynamic environment for any appliance to work, especially one that has to navigate an ever-changing landscape of shoes, socks, and Lego bricks. I think this is where the next big hardware and software leaps will take place—not in overpriced virtual reality headsets or chatbot-enabled pins that struggle to download updates, but with devices that are trying to solve the very real problem of how to not constantly live in filth. It’s hard to get upset about that.",

    "content_text": "One of the great joys of camping is the silence. There’s nothing worse than getting out into the wilderness, away from society, and then hearing somebody one campsite over start up a loud, smelly gas generator.\nPebble, a California-based company that is building a new travel trailer, is hoping that an electric RV is just the thing to bring some quiet to the glamping life.\nThe Pebble Flow is a travel trailer with a big ol' battery in its floor. It can run the lights, shower, heating, and air-conditioning, and anything else you might want to use power for out in the woods. The battery also powers a towing assist feature, so the Flow can give itself an extra push when you tow it down the road, easing the burden on the vehicle you’re using to haul the camper.\nPebble first announced the Flow in 2023, but it hasn't revealed the full array of features it is planning to put in the camper until today. In an announcement timed for the week of CES, Pebble says it will assemble and deliver its first campers in the first half of 2025. They are available for preorder now, starting at $109,000, but going up to $135,500 if you want to be able to control its features with a companion mobile app.\nIn the Flow\nThe Flow has the same aesthetic as many current-model EVs, with big windows and soft, curved features that aim to make it more aerodynamic. It looks like a futuristic luxury spaceship, or a really big fancy toaster, depending on how romantic you want to be about it. CEO Bingrui Yang is very romantic about it: He chose the name Pebble for the company because the naturally occurring smooth stones tend to bring people joy, and he wants the electrified camper to foster that same feeling of serenity.\nI got the chance to wander the tight space of a Pebble Flow demo unit at Pebble’s headquarters in Fremont, California. It holds just about everything you’d want if you’re out RV’ing. Inside is a kitchen with an induction stove, convection oven, sink, microwave, and refrigerator. The cabinets have ample storage, and there are concealed hatches in the floor for more storage. Most of the windows pop open if you need to let in the breeze. In the back rests a queen-size Murphy bed that retracts into the wall to make space. A dining table can be broken down into a second bed at the other end of the trailer. A bathroom and shower sit right in the middle of the floorplan. A glass wall separates it from the rest of the interior, but the person in the bathroom can press a button to electronically frost the glass if they need a private poo.\nFor the experienced RV enthusiast, this probably all seems like standard fare for a trailer that costs over a hundred grand. Well, you’re right, but what Pebble is hoping is that its EV-like add-ons make the Flow special.\nThe Flow is powered by a 45-kWh lithium-ion battery built into the floor of the camper. That’s slightly smaller than the batteries built into compact EVs currently on the market, and about half the size of the auto industry’s largest EV batteries. Pebble says the battery can power the interior systems for up to seven days on a full charge. A set of 1-kW solar panels built into the roof can juice the battery part of the way back up while you’re on the road, and regenerative charging kicks in during towing. It has vehicle-to-load tech as well, so you can connect to the Flow to use it as a backup power source or EV charger.\nThe Pebble Flow is not actually an E-RV in the sense that it can function as a vehicle on its own. You'll need another rig to tow it anywhere. Pebble says that while towing with a hybrid or gas engine vehicle is probably going to get you farther, you can tow it with another EV. The 25-foot trailer weighs 5,800 pounds on its own, and can get up to 6,800 pounds loaded up, so it will take some muscle to move it. The Pebble website does show the Flow being towed by a Cybertruck. (While I was at the company’s headquarters, I noticed a matte black Cybertruck in the parking lot. It belongs to Pebble’s CTO, who gushed about it while I was there.)\nThe powered towing assist feature can be toggled on when the Flow is in motion. While the motors provide a decent push behind a real vehicle, they are just powerful enough to roll the Flow around a little using a smartphone app, though it only moves about 1 mile per hour on its own. That is enough to spin it in a very slow circle, but not anywhere near enough to get you down the block. What it does let you do is maneuver the trailer into place at the campsite without having to push and drag it around with your car. Just unhitch the Flow, grab your iPad, and steer it like a giant, slow RC car into the perfect spot. Engaging the tow-assist mode or driving it around the campsite will definitely reduce the trailer’s battery life for actual camping activities, as you can imagine.\nPebble has a feature it calls Magic Hitch (it’s not actually magic) that lets you use the app to hook the Flow up to the trailer hitch on your towing vehicle. Just guide it in with the controls on the screen, and when the Flow is close enough, hold a button and the hitch will use its attached camera to find the exact spot to hook on. Another feature, called InstaCamp, lets you park the trailer on an uneven surface and then press a button to have the camper level itself automatically.\nThe Flow isn’t the only electric RV out there. RV mainstays Airstream and Winnebago both have prototype EVs, but they’re due out later this year. The Volkswagen ID Buzz conjures #vanlife vibes and is sort of a compact RV. Lightship is another electric trailer that looks very similar to the Pebble Flow. Who knows who will be first in the fight to the campground, but at least they’ll be quiet when they’re out there.\nUpdated: 1/7/25 at 10:30 am PT: Corrected the weight of the Pebble Flow. The trailer has a gross vehicle weight rating of 6,800 pounds, not 6,200 pounds as Pebble had stated on its website at the time this story published.",

It belongs to Pebble’s CTO, who gushed about it while I was there.)</p><p class=\"paywall\">The powered towing assist feature can be toggled on when the Flow is in motion. While the motors provide a decent push behind a real vehicle, they are just powerful enough to roll the Flow around a little using a smartphone app, though it only moves about 1 mile per hour on its own. That is enough to spin it in a very slow circle, but not anywhere near enough to get you down the block. What it does let you do is maneuver the trailer into place at the campsite without having to push and drag it around with your car. Just unhitch the Flow, grab your iPad, and steer it like a giant, slow RC car into the perfect spot. Engaging the tow-assist mode or driving it around the campsite will definitely reduce the trailer’s battery life for actual camping activities, as you can imagine.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Pebble has a feature it calls Magic Hitch (it’s not actually magic) that lets you use the app to hook the Flow up to the trailer hitch on your towing vehicle. Just guide it in with the controls on the screen, and when the Flow is close enough, hold a button and the hitch will use its attached camera to find the exact spot to hook on. Another feature, called InstaCamp, lets you park the trailer on an uneven surface and then press a button to have the camper level itself automatically.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "In spring 2024, rapper Iggy Azalea was casting about for a concept that she could try to transmute into a hit crypto coin. It had to be memeable—that is, easily remixed and riffed upon—and it had to be attention-grabbing.\nOn May 29, Azalea launched the Mother Iggy (MOTHER) coin. For its emblem, she selected a picture of her derriere. Within two weeks, the coin had reached a total value of $240 million. (At the time of writing, MOTHER is worth around $50 million.)\n“Everybody knows that I have a big butt—it goes viral easily … The butt is just an easy inroad,” Azalea told WIRED at the time of the launch. “My concept for MOTHER has overarchingly been that I love mothers in pop culture and movies; those characters are oftentimes quite deranged, powerful, and crazy, but you respect them. In a Freudian way, there’s also a weird obsession with your friend’s hot mom. I can play on this 1,001 different ways.”\nAround that time, a bunch of other celebrities—from Caitlyn Jenner to Andrew Tate and Jason Derulo—were all launching their own crypto coins. The pile-on reflected a renewed fervor among traders for memecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that generally has no utility beyond financial speculation.\nBecause memecoins do not generate revenue or cash flow, their value is entirely based on the attention they attract, which can fluctuate wildly. Though some people make a lot of money on memecoins, many others lose out. With a general euphoria taking hold in cryptoland as the price of bitcoin rises to historic levels above $100,000, the stage is set for yet further memecoin “degeneracy,” says Azeem Khan, cofounder of the Morph blockchain and venture partner at crypto VC firm Foresight Ventures.\n“Things are about to get crazier,” he says. “Because there are no regulations or internationally understood laws that people abide by for doing this, we are in a phase where [peak] degeneracy has not even happened yet.”\nPreviously, the cost and complexity of development limited the number of memecoins that made it to market. But in 2024, with the help of Pump.Fun, a platform that lets people issue memecoins almost instantly and at no cost, the floodgates opened: More than 4.7 million unique memecoins have been issued through the platform since its January launch. In aggregate, the memecoin market is now worth more than $100 billion.\n“I knew it was going to work on the first day we launched,” one of the three anonymous cofounders of Pump.Fun, who goes by Sapijiju, told WIRED earlier this year. “I could just see from the Twitter activity.”\nThe sudden glut of coins forced creators to come up with ways to differentiate their projects, sometimes going to elaborate and sometimes dangerous lengths to attract attention to their coins and compete with celebrities’ large online followings. One guy ended up catching on fire after a stunt went awry, leaving him with serious burns. The market mutated: In the same way that celebcoins had a moment, so did memecoins inspired by Donald Trump and other political figures, coins promoted by AI chatbots—and even one coin launched by a child.\nFor all the goofiness, memecoin fever has been embraced by some corners of the crypto industry. In search of outsize returns, a small number of hedge funds have invested in memecoins this year. Other investment firms, like Pantera Capital, consider memecoins to be a “Trojan horse” likely to introduce new people to crypto.\nThe idea, says Robert Le, a crypto analyst at market data company PitchBook, is that memecoin activity on a particular crypto network will translate into a readymade audience for future projects with practical utility built on the same underlying infrastructure. “It does bring some kind of tangential value to other real projects,” says Le.\nBut others say the memecoin phenomenon is likely to damage crypto by perpetuating the view that the industry is nothing but a paradise for gamblers and grifters. “At best, it looks like a risky casino. Or a series of false promises masking a casino,” wrote Eddy Lazarin, CTO at the crypto division of the venture capital firm a16z, in April. “This deeply affects adoption, regulation/laws, and builder behavior. I see the damage every day. You should too.”\nThe irony is that memecoins have largely escaped the attention of US financial regulators under the Biden administration, while entrepreneurs attempting to establish meaningful crypto use cases have been targeted for investigation, said Chris Dixon, head of a16z crypto, in an interview with WIRED last year. “The dumbest crypto things, like Dogecoin, which is completely meaningless and silly—that’s perfectly legal,” said Dixon.\nThere is a potential future in which memecoins could be used by entrepreneurs as a vehicle to raise capital for earnest crypto projects without giving away equity, says Khan. But for now, they represent financial speculation in its rawest form. “We’ve constantly been in this place where as an industry we are seen as a decentralized version of Macau or Vegas. This does nothing to help us in this way,” he says.\nWhether or not memecoins are damaging to the crypto industry’s prospects or reputation, a crackdown of some form is likely, industry watchers say, such is the amount of money flying around and the level of risk to traders.\n“Memecoins is absolutely a PvP game. For someone to win, someone has to lose. A lot of the people that can least afford to lose money are going to be the ones who lose the most,” says Khan. “There has got to be a crackdown at some point.”\nBecause memecoins defy easy comparison with traditional investment assets, says Le, they are perhaps best regulated by gambling authorities. “It is basically unregulated gambling. It’s going to probably come down to the purview of whoever the regulator of gambling is in each country,” he says. “Through the grapevine, I’m already hearing some state regulators in the US talking about doing some kind of regulation.” Pump.Fun declined to comment.\nUntil such a time, though, memecoins will continue to do their thing. On December 5, Hailey Welch of “Hawk Tuah” fame launched a coin, which lost 95 percent of its value in the first hours of trading, leading to an outcry. That same day, traders were throwing money at PNUT, a coin modeled after the celebrity squirrel euthanized late last year by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, currently valued at more than $1 billion.\nSince launching MOTHER, Azalea has promoted the coin relentlessly to her 7.7 million followers on X, through a flurry of provocative images and meme posts. Part of her plan to ensure her coin has longevity—a rarity in memecoins—is to establish some sort of utility for it. The coin is now accepted as payment by a telecom startup in which Azalea has a stake. “I plan to be here for the long haul. And I will be,” she says.\nEventually, Azalea hopes to parlay the memecoin into other business opportunities—including setting up her own venture fund—by proving to prospective partners and investors that she can identify and ride the zeitgeist.\n“I’ve always been a big shitposter,” she says. “I do like to bait, to troll, to say things that are a little provocative. I like to say things and move in ways that I know can be memeable … It’s about virality, ultimately.”",

    "content_text": "Are you a coder? Please take our new survey (it's short and fun) about how you use AI at work.\nHTML is deceptive. It looks easy. And easy HTML is easy. With a few tags you can write your name on a webpage, make it bigger or smaller, add “is awesome” in bold or italics, and even—for those of us who came of age in better times—make it blink or scroll across the screen.\nBecause HTML looks easy and lacks features like formal conditional logic and Turing-completeness, it’s often dismissed as not a programming language. “That’s not real code; it’s just markup” is a common refrain. Now, I’m no stranger to the austere beauty of the command line, from automating scripts to training machine-learning models. But underestimating HTML is a mistake.\nHTML is the most significant computing language, programming or otherwise, ever developed. Every other programming language has to grapple with how HTML has redefined computing over the past 30-plus years. So many “pure” programming languages automate the production of more and more HTML.\nWhen haters deny HTML’s status as a programming language, they’re showing they don’t understand what a language really is. Language is not instructing an interlocutor what to do in a way that leaves no room for other interpretations; it is better and richer than that. Like human language, HTML is conversational. It is remarkably adept at adapting to context. It can take a different shape on any machine, from a desktop browser or an e-reader screen to a mobile app or a screen reader for the blind (so long as that device is built to present hypertext).\nHTML is somehow simultaneously paper and the printing press for the electronic age. It’s both how we write and what we read. It’s the most democratic computer language and the most global. It’s the medium we use to connect with each other and publish to the world. It makes perfect sense that it was developed to serve as a library—an archive, a directory, a set of connections—for all digital knowledge.\nLike many readers my age, I encountered HTML in 1994, during those heady days when Netscape’s browser brought the web to much more of the world. In my case, the internet was available on just a few machines at my high school—I didn’t have a computer at home, let alone dial-up—but I quickly made myself an amateur expert in navigating the strange new space that Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues had brought into being.\nAn older friend showed me how he built his own homepage, complete with animated “under construction” GIFs, an interactive Magic 8-Ball, and a handful of bandwidth-devouring photos. Since I didn’t have an email address, he set up a text entry field on his site where I could send him messages, with stern instructions that the textbox was “only for TIM.” He’d post his own responses directly on the website, so I (and theoretically anyone) could read them when I next got access to a machine. This is what passed for information security for two low-risk targets in those days.\nThe idea that you could build something fun for your friends, but potentially anyone in the world could discover it, was intoxicating. So was the language itself. Most raw HTML then was easy for humans, even newcomers, to understand. You didn’t need a primer in formal logic to grasp that most tags needed to be opened and closed (like parentheses in a math statement or ordinary sentence) to function as intended. And you didn’t need to be a mischief-minded teenager to see the possibilities in what happened when HTML “broke.”\nTo learn any programming language is to learn how to debug it. But a malformed command in Python usually returns an error message that keeps the code from running, not something that fails brilliantly yet monstrously, outpacing its creators’ intentions. With HTML, we are all Doctor Frankenstein.\nOne of my favorite websites of all time is the Embroidery Troubleshooting Guide. These days it’s available only via the Internet Archive, unless (like me) you have a local copy. At the top, it looks like a typical, if somewhat old-fashioned, small-business website. But when you glance down, you immediately notice something strange about it. The text, all center-aligned in alternating red and blue Arial, gradually gets bigger and bigger, with phrases forced to wrap lines or reach the edge mid-word, filling up the screen like Alice trying to squeeze through smaller and smaller doors in Wonderland.\nWhen you view the source code (have any other programs made it so easy to view source like a website?), you’ll quickly discover what’s gone wrong. Each line of centered text begins with <h2> or <h3> header tags that never close. Each header tag—which only establishes a relative size, not an absolute one, part of the semantic richness of the web’s flexible grammar—builds on the last, creating progressively larger nesting dolls. The tag designed for defining textual hierarchy runs amok, creating chaos. The fact that the words themselves are about how and why threads can break makes it poetry.\nOn its own, the Embroidery Troubleshooting Guide would be a clever enough piece of found conceptual art. But by viewing the source, downloading the file, and replacing the instructions for troubleshooting common sewing problems with any text you like, you can make that artwork your own. I like to put in my favorite poetry, decontextualizing it and forcing myself to read it with new eyes.\n“Broken” sites like these upend the great achievement of semantic HTML. As it developed, semantic HTML increasingly separated structure from presentation: Instead of <i> tags, which strictly specify that a text be presented in italics, we use <em> tags to identify emphasis (or <cite> tags for titles of books or movies, etc.). These elements can then be presented as italics on a computer screen but be read with a different intonation by a screen reader. The Embroidery Troubleshooting Guide hijacks a semantic tag and makes it present something unexpected. The same building blocks that allow a single website to be displayed responsively on a tiny phone or enormous television screen can make a website fundamentally undisplayable. This is delightful.\nI appreciate the utility of content management systems and complex sites that generate HTML dynamically, but there’s a joy in building sites out of simple HTML files you can edit by hand. I still edit my own website this way, tidying it up so I can see every tag, section, and paragraph break. I even love editing my own ebooks, turning PDFs into nicely formatted HTML-based EPUB files that never get published to anyone: my own private library of self-contained websites. During the height of the pandemic, editing these files and their style sheets by hand was a balm.\nUltimately, even as HTML has become the province of professionals, it cannot be gatekept. This is what makes so many programmers so anxious about the web, and sometimes pathetically desperate to maintain the all-too-real walls they’ve erected between software engineers and web developers. But people who write HTML know that hierarchies were made to be blown up. All it takes is a tag that doesn’t close where you’d expect it to.\nWhat other programmers might say dismissively is something HTML lovers embrace: Anyone can do it. Whether we’re using complex frameworks or very simple tools, HTML’s promise is that we can build, make, code, and do anything we want.",

This is delightful.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I appreciate the utility of content management systems and complex sites that generate HTML dynamically, but there’s a joy in building sites out of simple HTML files you can edit by hand. I still edit my own website this way, tidying it up so I can see every tag, section, and paragraph break. I even love editing my own ebooks, turning PDFs into nicely formatted HTML-based EPUB files that never get published to anyone: my own private library of self-contained websites.

However, so far these algorithms have largely remained relegated to the digital world, rather than the physical, three-dimensional world we live in. In fact, whenever we attempt to apply these models to the real world even the most sophisticated struggle to perform adequately—just think, for instance, of how challenging it has been to develop safe and reliable self-driving cars. While artificially intelligent, not only do these models simply have no grasp of physics but they also often hallucinate, which leads them to make inexplicable mistakes.\nThis is the year, however, when AI will finally make the leap from the digital world to the real world we inhabit.

This is what I call “physical intelligence”, a new form of intelligent machine that can understand dynamic environments, cope with unpredictability, and make decisions in real time. Unlike the models used by standard AI, physical intelligence is rooted in physics; in understanding the fundamental principles of the real world, such as cause-and-effect.\nSuch features allow physical intelligence models to interact and adapt to different environments. In my research group at MIT, we are developing models of physical intelligence which we call liquid networks. In one experiment, for instance, we trained two drones—one operated by a standard AI model and another by a liquid network—to locate objects in a forest during the summer, using data captured by human pilots. While both drones performed equally well when tasked to do exactly what they had been trained to do, when they were asked to locate objects in different circumstances—during the winter or in an urban setting—only the liquid network drone successfully completed its task.

    "content_text": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nBacteria are in, around and all over us. They thrive in almost every corner of the planet, from deep-sea hydrothermal vents to high up in the clouds, to the crevices of your ears, mouth, nose, and gut. But scientists have long assumed that bacteria can’t survive in the human brain. The powerful blood-brain barrier, the thinking goes, keeps the organ mostly free from outside invaders. But are we sure that a healthy human brain doesn’t have a microbiome of its own?\nOver the past decade, initial studies have presented conflicting evidence. The idea has remained controversial, given the difficulty of obtaining healthy, uncontaminated human brain tissue that could be used to study possible microbial inhabitants.\nRecently, a study published in Science Advances provided the strongest evidence yet that a brain microbiome can and does exist in healthy vertebrates—fish, specifically. Researchers at the University of New Mexico discovered communities of bacteria thriving in salmon and trout brains. Many of the microbial species have special adaptations that allow them to survive in brain tissue, as well as techniques to cross the protective blood-brain barrier.\nMatthew Olm, a physiologist who studies the human microbiome at the University of Colorado, Boulder and was not involved with the study, is “inherently skeptical” of the idea that populations of microbes could live in the brain, he said. But he found the new research convincing. “This is concrete evidence that brain microbiomes do exist in vertebrates,” he said. “And so the idea that humans have a brain microbiome is not outlandish.”\nWhile fish physiology is, in many ways, similar to humans’, there are some key differences. Still, “it certainly puts another weight on the scale to think about whether this is relevant to mammals and us,” said Christopher Link, who studies the molecular basis of neurodegenerative disease at the University of Colorado, Boulder and was also not involved in the work.\nThe human gut microbiome plays a critical role in the body, communicating with the brain and maintaining the immune system through the gut-brain axis. So it isn’t totally far-fetched to suggest that microbes could play an even larger role in our neurobiology.\nFishing for Microbes\nFor years, Irene Salinas has been fascinated by a simple physiological fact: The distance between the nose and the brain is quite small. The evolutionary immunologist, who works at the University of New Mexico, studies mucosal immune systems in fish to better understand how human versions of these systems, such as our intestinal lining and nasal cavity, work. The nose, she knows, is loaded with bacteria, and they’re “really, really close” to the brain—mere millimeters from the olfactory bulb, which processes smell. Salinas has always had a hunch that bacteria might be leaking from the nose into the olfactory bulb. After years of curiosity, she decided to confront her suspicion in her favorite model organisms: fish.\nSalinas and her team started by extracting DNA from the olfactory bulbs of trout and salmon, some caught in the wild and some raised in her lab. (Important contributions to the research were made by Amir Mani, the lead author of the paper.) They planned to look up the DNA sequences in a database to identify any microbial species.\nThese kinds of samples, however, are easily contaminated—by bacteria in the lab or from other parts of a fish’s body—which is why scientists have struggled to study this subject effectively. If they did find bacterial DNA in the olfactory bulb, they would have to convince themselves and other researchers that it truly originated in the brain.\nTo cover their bases, Salinas’ team studied the fishes’ whole-body microbiomes, too. They sampled the rest of the fishes’ brains, guts, and blood; they even drained blood from the many capillaries of the brain to make sure that any bacteria they discovered resided in the brain tissue itself.\n“We had to go back and redo [the experiments] many, many times just to be sure,” Salinas said. The project took five years—but even in the early days it was clear that the fish brains weren’t barren.\nAs Salinas expected, the olfactory bulb hosted some bacteria. But she was shocked to see that the rest of the brain had even more. “I thought the other parts of the brain wouldn’t have bacteria,” she said. “But it turned out that my hypothesis was wrong.” The fish brains hosted so much that it took only a few minutes to locate bacterial cells under a microscope. As an additional step, her team confirmed that the microbes were actively living in the brain; they weren’t dormant or dead.\nOlm was impressed by their thorough approach. Salinas and her team circled “the same question, from all these different ways, using all these different methods—all of which produced convincing data that there actually are living microbes in the salmon brain,” he said.\nBut if there are, how did they get there?\nInvading the Fortress\nResearchers have long been skeptical that the brain could have a microbiome because all vertebrates, including fish, have a blood-brain barrier. These blood vessels and surrounding brain cells are fortified to serve as gatekeepers that allow only some molecules in and out of the brain and keep invaders, especially larger ones like bacteria, out. So Salinas naturally wondered how the brains in her study had been colonized.\nBy comparing microbial DNA from the brain to that collected from other organs, her lab found a subset of species that didn’t appear elsewhere in the body. Salinas hypothesized that these species may have colonized the fish brains early in their development, before their blood-brain barriers had fully formed. “Early on, anything can go in; it’s a free-for-all,” she said.\nBut many of the microbial species were also found throughout the body. She suspects that most bacteria in the fishes’ brain microbiomes originated in their blood and guts, and continuously leak into the brain.\n“After that first wave of colonization,” she said, “you need to have specific features to go in and out.”\nSalinas was able to identify features that let bacteria make the crossing. Some could produce molecules, known as polyamines, that can open and close junctions, which are like little doors in the barrier that allow molecules to pass through. Others could produce molecules that help them evade the body’s immune response or compete with other bacteria.\nSalinas even caught a bacterium in the act. Looking under the microscope, she captured an image of a bacterium frozen in time within the blood-brain barrier. “We literally caught it right in the middle of crossing,” she said.\nIt is possible that the microbes don’t live freely in the brain tissue but are engulfed by immune cells. That would be the “most boring interpretation of this paper,” Olm said, and would suggest that the fish have adapted to bacterial inhabitants by containing them.\nHowever, if the bacteria are free-living, they could be involved in the body’s processes beyond the brain. It’s possible that the microbes actively regulate aspects of the creatures’ physiology, Salinas suggested, the way human gut microbiomes help regulate the digestive and immune systems.\nFish, of course, are not humans, but they allow a fair comparison, Salinas said. And her work suggests that if fish have microbes living in their brains, it’s possible we have them, too.\nImpenetrable or Not?\nBacteria have been found living in just about every human organ system, but to many scientists the brain is a step too far. The blood-brain barrier has traditionally been seen as “impenetrable,” said Janosch Heller, who studies the barrier at Dublin City University and was not involved in the new research. Plus, the brain has immune cells working overtime to zap any potentially harmful invaders. When microbes have been found in the human brain, they are are associated with active infections or typically linked to a breakdown in the barrier due to diseases such as Alzheimer’s.\nThis assumption was challenged in 2013, when scientists studying the neurological impacts of HIV/AIDS found genetic hints of bacteria in the brains of both sick and healthy people. The findings were the first to suggest that maybe humans could have a brain microbiome in the absence of disease.\n“No one believed it 10 years ago,” Heller said. Follow-up studies—there haven’t been many—have been inconclusive. “It is very easy to trick yourself into thinking microbes are present because microbial DNA is essentially everywhere,” Olm said. “So it would take a lot of evidence to convince me that it does exist.”\nThe fish experiment did convince him, and other researchers, that a human brain microbiome is not impossible. What is nearly impossible, however, is confirming that without harming healthy people. To build a case, Link suggested repeating the fish experiment in rodents. “This protocol should be able to be adapted really easily to mouse brains,” Salinas said—and indeed her team has started looking into it. They have found early hints that microbes exist in the olfactory bulbs of healthy mice and, to a lesser extent, throughout the brain.\n“There’s no reason, if fish have them, that you wouldn’t have them, or that mice wouldn’t have them,” Link said. If microbes have adapted to cross the fish blood-brain barrier and survive in the fish brain, they could do the same in our bodies. It’s unlikely they would be present at the same levels as they are in fish, he added, “but that doesn’t mean there’s none.”\nEven in small numbers, Link said, resident microbes could influence our brain metabolism and immune systems. If they are truly present, this would suggest an extra layer of neurological regulation that we didn’t know existed. We already know that microbes influence our neurobiology: Right now, microbes in your gut are modulating your brain activity through the gut-brain axis by producing metabolites that are sensed by enteric neurons winding through your digestive system.\nIt’s a fascinating, though unproved, proposition that bacteria in the brain are directly impacting our physiology. However, thanks to research like Salinas’, more scientists are open to the idea that healthy human brains might also be home to microbes.\n“Why not?” Heller said. “I’m not shocked anymore that they are there.” The more interesting question, he said, is: “Are they all there for a reason, or are they there by mistake?”\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

    "content_text": "The new year is a time for reflection, renewal, and rampant speculation about what wonders (or fresh hell) the future might hold. No place does this mix of anxiety and forward-looking techno-evangelism spring forth more profusely than at CES.\nThe giant consumer tech showcase is barreling down on Las Vegas starting January 7, bringing with it a whirlwind of fuss about the newest gadgets and devices. And yes, you bet all these things are going to be packed full of AI features. You’re probably going to be asked to wear many of them.\nAI has dominated CES—and seemingly every facet of our culture—for the past couple of years. A tsunami of AI tech broke on the shores of CES 2024, and while the floodwaters may have receded a bit since then, the storm of hype around AI’s promise will keep the surge coming.\n“You will certainly see AI wearables from the slew of vendors at CES,” says Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at the analyst firm IDC. “I don't think it's going to be similar to what we saw last year, where you had lots of dedicated hardware for AI. More so it will be AI being incorporated into existing devices or it being an additional feature of a device as opposed to the only thing that it’s good for.”\nAI Wrapped\nWith most of the spoils of the current AI boom going to the industry's apex predators—OpenAI, Google, Meta—and their mature, well trained language models, startups who want to compete are focusing more on the physical layer of the user experience.\n“You're not going to add any value by creating your own AI model,” says Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. “So the next step is implementing the AI. The easiest way to do that is with some kind of hardware.”\nWe saw a lot of these AI-powered devices in 2024. Together they showed a variety of use cases, but they were mostly still just vessels for utilizing AI on something that wasn’t your phone or computer. Some of them licensed models like ChatGPT while others used bespoke software to power their interactions, but both paths have been rocky. Devices like Humane AI pin and Rabbit R1 kicked off the trend, though they were ultimately underwhelming. The wearable Friend necklace, which you interact with through a mobile app, garnered controversy for being a device with an always-listening microphone. Others have hinted at greater ambitions, like the Plaud.AI pin, which for now summarizes your meetings but could eventually be instructed to attend the meeting for you.\nThere are still many more dedicated AI devices to come. Some could be useful, and some are leaning on AI interactions just to appear forward-looking or drum up interest. Whatever the flavor of AI gadget, CES will be the place to stick, strap, slip, and clip them on. We will see the debut of new necklaces, eyewear, pins, and of course headphones. I've lost count of how many press pitches I have received ahead of the event from companies wanting to show off their earbuds built specifically for AI that let you interact with Her-esque chatbots. There are even sex toys. (I will spare you the content of those emails.)\nWhether any of them will implement chatbots and agents well or in new and exciting ways is much harder to say. While the addition of AI may have been enough to garner the investment needed to build a device, it may not be enough to get people to actually buy the thing. Chatbots and AI agents don't yet provide enough of a use case to justify people pinning them to their shirts en masse. We’re also at a point of AI saturation where the tech is in everything. So then, what makes your AI earbuds special?\n“That's the problem a lot of these startups have; if AI is their differentiator, then what happens when everybody has it?” Sag says. “It’s now table stakes.”\nWearables and devices built specifically to provide some AI-powered services may have seemed like the logical next step in the AI evolution, but so far the utility we’re getting from them doesn’t push any boundaries.\n“The reality is we don't need dedicated hardware for the kind of features or use cases that they're showing off,” Ubrani says. “Your phone can do most of those things.”\nIn the space of a year, AI has gone from being a selling point on its own to something akin to a slightly more potent form of vanilla.\nMaking a Dent\nThere are AI hardware success stories, of course, such as the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which have done well by incorporating AI as one of many features in a device that offers use cases—taking pictures, listening to music—well beyond what AI can do on its own. (This will certainly be a year filled with smart glasses, and CES is bound to brimming with them too.)\nMeta, of course, is one of those giant companies with resources to put into incorporating AI into its services. Smaller manufacturers may not have the financial stamina to compete, but they're feeling the pressure to get in on the game all the same.\n“It’s going to be difficult to see how those smaller startups survive,” Sag says.\nSag says there are ways to stand out from the big devices and glut of other AI gadgets in the mix. Privacy, for instance. Meta may have the most successful smart glasses right now, but the company’s platform is a data vacuum that sucks up almost every bit of information about its users that it can. Sag points toward competitors like Even Realities or Looktech.AI, which make smart glasses that allow broad user controls over privacy settings and don’t necessarily just send every bit of data back to the mothership. He says startups like those can use the more secure approach to differentiate their products, offering users an alternative to the big, data mining platforms.\nNo matter how safe and secure the tech is, people are still going to want something that fundamentally does something beneficial for them.\n“The next kind of wave of this is like, well, what is AI doing for me right now other than telling me that I have AI?” Sag says. “A lot of AI isn't necessarily driving sales, because it's not really changing people’s lives.”",

So then, what makes your AI earbuds special?</p><p class=\"paywall\">“That's the problem a lot of these startups have; if AI is their differentiator, then what happens when everybody has it?” Sag says. “It’s now table stakes.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Wearables and devices built specifically to provide some AI-powered services may have seemed like the logical next step in the AI evolution, but so far the utility we’re getting from them doesn’t push any boundaries.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“The reality is we don't need dedicated hardware for the kind of features or use cases that they're showing off,” Ubrani says. “Your phone can do most of those things.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">In the space of a year, AI has gone from being a selling point on its own to something akin to a slightly more potent form of vanilla.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Making a Dent</h2><p class=\"paywall\">There are AI hardware success stories, of course, such as the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-ray-ban-meta-wayfarers-are-the-best-face-computer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ray-Ban Meta</a> smart glasses, which have done well by incorporating AI as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-intelligence-ai-feature-not-product/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">one of many features</a> in a device that offers use cases—taking pictures, listening to music—well beyond what AI can do on its own. (This will certainly be a year <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/smart-glasses-all-the-way-down/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">filled with smart glasses</a>, and CES is bound to brimming with them too.)</p><p class=\"paywall\">Meta, of course, is one of those giant companies with resources to put into incorporating AI into its services. Smaller manufacturers may not have the financial stamina to compete, but they're feeling the pressure to get in on the game all the same.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“It’s going to be difficult to see how those smaller startups survive,” Sag says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Sag says there are ways to stand out from the big devices and glut of other AI gadgets in the mix. Privacy, for instance. Meta may have the most successful smart glasses right now, but the company’s platform is a data vacuum that sucks up almost every bit of information about its users that it can. Sag points toward competitors like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/review-even-realities-g1-smart-glasses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Even Realities</a> or <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.looktech.ai/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.looktech.ai/\" href=\"https://www.looktech.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Looktech.AI</a>, which make smart glasses that allow broad user controls over privacy settings and don’t necessarily just send every bit of data back to the mothership. He says startups like those can use the more secure approach to differentiate their products, offering users an alternative to the big, data mining platforms.</p><p class=\"paywall\">No matter how safe and secure the tech is, people are still going to want something that fundamentally does something beneficial for them.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“The next kind of wave of this is like, well, what is AI doing for me right now other than telling me that I have AI?” Sag says. “A lot of AI isn't necessarily driving sales, because it's not really changing people’s lives.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, they are also environments where harassment, hate speech, and grooming for violence and sexual exploration frequently occur. Today, most players of online games report being a direct target or witnessing one or more of these actions. A 2024 report found 82 percent of players report being a direct victim, and 88 percent report witnessing some form of so-called \"toxic\" behavior. Sexual harassment and hate speech are quite common, with more than 70 percent of game players saying they have witnessed these behaviors while gaming.\nIn the most extreme cases, players face violations of privacy and their right to life, for instance, when their private personal information is maliciously shared online for the purpose of intimidation—so-called doxxing. In early 2024, for instance, an organized hate campaign started against the small narrative design studio Sweet Baby Inc. Believed to be pushing a \"woke agenda\" in games with their consultancy, their employees received numerous rape and death threats.\nThere are a number of reasons why games have come to be associated with hate and discrimination. The most important factor, however, is the lack of industry-wide innovation. For instance, video games are often sidelined in regulatory conversations about online safety. Proprietary data is proprietary, and (understandably) no company wants to be the first to talk publicly about online harms and safety challenges. Games are also, at the end of the day, businesses. Talking about one’s shortcomings is not likely to be something that garners shareholder support.\nHowever, in 2025, we’ll finally start to see industry-wide efforts prioritizing safety. Some of these shifts will be due to government mandates. While video games have long been excluded from regulatory conversations, they are beholden to some of the new initiatives that have recently been enacted. For example, the Digital Services Act in the European Union requires gaming companies who operate there to submit public-facing transparency reports about online harms within their spaces and the efficacy of their tools to combat them. For the first time, this will allow for industry-wide insights into the strategies and their effectiveness across the gaming ecosystem.\nIn 2025, we will also start to see the effects of the game industry's attempts at self-regulation. Over the last several years, there have been many trust and safety initiatives spearheaded by the game industry itself from an ecosystem, industry-level approach. For example, in 2024 we saw the release of the Digital Thriving Playbook from the Thriving in Games Group, Riot Games, and the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop, which provides educational material and step-by-step guides for game developers on how to create more resilient communities, and approaches to trust and safety issues in games. It also includes guides on content moderation and community management approaches, as well as teamwork by design, trust by design, and building prosocial behavior in gaming communities.\nLast year also saw another breakthrough, with the partnership between Epic Games and the International Age Rating Coalition to create internationally recognized ratings for all user-generated content created for Fortnite. Historically, player-created content has been unrated, leaving users to essentially make their best guess on age-appropriateness from the experience name, image, and description. The integration of a ratings system on user generated content will allow players (and parents) to make more informed decisions as to what and how they will play. In 2025, other game makers will follow suit to support players’ ability to make informed choices about which (of the billions of pieces of) user-generated content is safe and appropriate for them to engage with.\nTo be clear, a safe community does not mean there is no risk. Hate, harassment, and other forms of social harm will always exist in some form or another online. But in 2025, the video game industry will finally have more cohesive safety strategies in place to better protect players from social harm.

    "content_text": "Although SpaceX founder Elon Musk is known for outspokenness and controversial comments on his social media site X, he has been relatively restrained when it comes to US space policy in recent years.\nFor example, he has rarely criticized NASA or its overall goal to return humans to the moon through the Artemis program. Rather, Musk, who has long preferred Mars as a destination for humans, has more or less been a team player when it comes to the space agency's lunar-focused plans.\nThis is understandable from a financial perspective, as SpaceX has contracts worth billions of dollars to not only build a Human Landing System as part of the Artemis program but also to supply food, cargo, and other logistics services to a planned Lunar Gateway in orbit around the moon.\nBut privately, Musk has been critical of NASA's plans, suggesting that the Artemis Program has been moving too slowly and is too reliant on contractors who seek cost-plus government contracts and are less interested in delivering results.\nSilent on Policy No Longer\nDuring the past 10 days, Musk has begun airing some of these private thoughts publicly. On Christmas Day, for example, Musk wrote on X, “The Artemis architecture is extremely inefficient, as it is a jobs-maximizing program, not a results-maximizing program. Something entirely new is needed.”\nThen, on Thursday evening, he added this: \"No, we’re going straight to Mars. The moon is a distraction.\"\nThese are definitive statements that directly contradict NASA's plans to send a series of human missions to the lunar south pole later this decade and establish a sustainable base of operations there with the Artemis program.\nIt would be one thing if Musk was just expressing his opinion as a private citizen. But since playing a significant part in the election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States last year, Musk has assumed an important advisory role for the incoming administration. He was also partly responsible for the expected nomination of private astronaut Jared Isaacman to become the next administrator of NASA. Although Musk is not directing US space policy, he certainly has a meaningful say in what happens.\nSo What Does This Mean for Artemis?\nThe fate of Artemis is an important question not just for NASA but for the US commercial space industry, the European Space Agency, and other international partners who have aligned with the return of humans to the moon. With Artemis, the United States is in competition with China to establish a meaningful presence on the surface of the moon.\nBased upon conversations with people involved in developing space policy for the Trump administration, I can make some educated guesses about how to interpret Musk's comments. None of these people, for example, would disagree with Musk's assertion that \"the Artemis architecture is extremely inefficient\" and that some changes are warranted.\nWith that said, the Artemis program is probably not going away. After all, it was the first Trump administration that created the program about five years ago. However, it may be less well-remembered that the first Trump White House pushed for more significant changes, including a \"major course correction\" at NASA.\n\"I call on NASA to adopt new policies and embrace a new mindset,\" then-vice president Mike Pence said in May 2019. \"If our current contractors can't meet this objective, then we'll find ones that will.\" (Speaking of the vice president, it's unlikely that the National Space Council will be reconstituted under JD Vance).\nTo a large extent, NASA resisted this change during the remainder of the Trump administration, keeping its core group of major contractors, such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin, in place. It had help from key US Senators, including Richard Shelby, the now-retired Republican from Alabama. But this time, the push for change is likely to be more concerted, especially with key elements of NASA's architecture, including the Space Launch System rocket, being bypassed by privately developed rockets such as SpaceX's Starship vehicle and Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket.\nNot One, but Both\nIn all likelihood, NASA will adopt a new \"Artemis\" plan that involves initiatives to both the moon and Mars. When Musk said \"we're going straight to Mars,\" he may have meant that this will be the thrust of SpaceX, with support from NASA. That does not preclude a separate initiative, possibly led by Blue Origin with help from NASA, to develop lunar return plans.\nIsaacman, who has been keeping a fairly low profile since his nomination, has not weighed in on Musk's comments. However, when his nomination was announced one month ago, he did make a germane comment on X.\n\"I was born after the moon landings; my children were born after the final space shuttle launch,\" he wrote. \"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place. We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"\nIn short, NASA is likely to adopt a two-lane strategy of reaching for both the moon and Mars. Whether the space agency is successful with either one will be a major question asked of the new administration.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "In 1981, less than a month after evidence of global warming was first reported on its front page, the The New York Times asked B. F. Skinner about the fate of humanity. The famous psychologist had recently argued that a feature of the human mind virtually guaranteed global environmental disaster. “Why do we not act to save our world?” Skinner asked, citing myriad threats to the planet.\nHis answer: Human behavior is governed almost entirely by our experiences—specifically, by which actions have been rewarded or punished in the past. The future, having not yet happened, will never have the same influence over what we do; we will seek familiar rewards today—money, comfort, security, pleasure, power—even when doing so threatens everyone on the planet tomorrow.\nSkinner was one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century, yet he rarely gets credit for the prescience of this warning, which predicted the behavior of fossil fuel executives and politicians for the next four decades. I have wrestled with it often. I am a pediatrician in Reno, Nevada, the fastest-warming city in the US. I look into the eyes of babies, children, and teens every day. Skinner argued that only when the consequences of environmental destruction moved from “tomorrow” to “today” would our choices change. I believe that in 2025, the harms to children will become so clear and immediate that parents—the sleeping giant in the climate fight—will wake up to what the fossil fuel industry has done.\nOver the past decade, for example, my city has been darkened for ever-longer stretches by wildfire smoke from California; 65 million Americans, mostly in the West, now experience such “smoke crises.” Everyone understands that smoke causes respiratory problems; all of us cough and wheeze when the air becomes hazardous for weeks at a time. Fewer understand that children are at more risk from these events for multiple reasons, mostly related to their different physiology, small size, and immature organs—which, because they are still developing, are very vulnerable to environmental injury. Children’s lungs, for example, are literally shaped by the quality of air they breathe. Children who chronically inhale particle pollution—such as those living in the most-polluted neighborhoods of Los Angeles—tend to develop smaller, stiffer lungs.\nIn 2025, the media will realize that harms from these tiny pollutants are even more profound. That’s because a growing body of science shows that fine and ultrafine particles, usually bound to toxic chemicals and heavy metals in wildfire smoke and exhaust, are causing brain injuries in children. Alarmingly, they appear to be contributing to the epidemic-like rise of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as increasing the odds of learning disability, behavior issues, and later dementia.\nWhy? Because these tiny pollutants don’t stop at the lungs; they invade the bloodstream and penetrate other organs, including the brain—which, like the lungs, is still growing and developing in a child, and thus more susceptible to harm.\nThe evidence of particles’ neurologic impacts comes from brain imaging, histology, and epidemiology. We know that even before birth, particles inhaled by pregnant women can cross the placenta and injure the fetus; MRI studies in several countries have shown altered brain architecture in prenatally exposed children, many of whom struggled with cognition and behavior. After birth, particles can also penetrate the prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain behind the forehead—after being inhaled through the nose. When scientists studied the brains of children and young adults in Mexico City, notorious for its bad air, they found fossil fuel particles, encased in Alzheimer’s-like plaques, embedded in the prefrontal cortex.\nEvidence of a link to autism and ADHD has emerged in more than a decade of epidemiological studies from around the world. In a multiyear study of almost 300,000 children from Southern California, for example, prenatal exposure to PM2.5 (the smallest particle regulated by law) was found to significantly increase autism rates. And a recent study of over 164,000 children in China found that long-term exposure to fine particles boosted the odds of ADHD. Though autism and ADHD are complex disorders with multiple causes both genetic and environmental, it is increasingly clear that air pollution—caused by fossil fuels and worsening due to climate change—is a significant risk factor.\nMost of the parents in my clinic—who lovingly buckle their children into car seats, brush their teeth, and bring them in for check-ups and vaccines—don’t know this. But I have spent countless hours with parents worried about autism. When they understand that the nearby coal-fired power plant or exhaust from their car or the explosion of climate-fueled wildfires can wound their child’s mind, I believe many will demand clean energy in their homes, schools, jobs, and communities.\nAir pollution won’t be the only climate-related threat directly affecting their children and driving a wave of activism. In the US and other developed countries, parents will realize that summer activities they enjoyed in childhood must now be limited because of heat. In developing countries such as India and Mexico, heat’s health impact will be far greater. Only 5 percent of homes in India and 16 percent of those in Mexico currently have air conditioning, compared to 90 percent in the US. The toll of this year’s heat waves in those countries will be heartbreaking: higher rates of pregnancy complications and maternal death, preterm birth, low birth weight, and infant mortality. In 2025, the media will start to cover these tragedies in a new way, clearly describing them as a crime and pointing to the corporations and politicians responsible.\nSkinner worried that our reaction to environmental catastrophe would come too late to avert it. But he did not anticipate that solutions like renewable energy could bring greater rewards, in immediate costs and benefits, than fossil fuels. Or that parents might come to see solar panels, heat pumps, and home insulation as this generation’s equivalent of the polio vaccine—something they demand to protect their children.\nWe think of climate change as a global problem. But it is in fact a very personal problem, multiplied many times. It is a threat to the people we love most: the children we hold in our arms and promise to keep safe. When the price that children are paying on behalf of fossil fuel corporations is right in front of us, parents—the great untapped voice in the climate fight—will lead a furious and rapid transition to a sustainable world.",

F. Skinner</a> about the fate of humanity. The famous psychologist had recently argued that a feature of the human mind virtually guaranteed global environmental disaster. “Why do we not act to save our world?” Skinner asked, citing myriad threats to the planet.</p><p class=\"paywall\">His answer: Human behavior is governed almost entirely by our experiences—specifically, by which actions have been rewarded or punished in the past. The future, having not yet happened, will never have the same influence over what we do; we will seek familiar rewards today—money, comfort, security, pleasure, power—even when doing so threatens everyone on the planet tomorrow.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Skinner was one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century, yet he rarely gets credit for the prescience of this warning, which predicted the behavior of fossil fuel executives and politicians for the next four decades. I have wrestled with it often.

I look into the eyes of babies, children, and teens every day. Skinner argued that only when the consequences of environmental destruction moved from “tomorrow” to “today” would our choices change.

Fewer understand that children are at more risk from these events for multiple reasons, mostly related to their different physiology, small size, and immature organs—which, because they are still developing, are very vulnerable to environmental injury. <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.lung.org/clean-air/outdoors/who-is-at-risk\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.lung.org/clean-air/outdoors/who-is-at-risk\" href=\"https://www.lung.org/clean-air/outdoors/who-is-at-risk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Children’s lungs</a>, for example, are literally shaped by the quality of air they breathe. Children who chronically inhale particle pollution—such as those living in the most-polluted neighborhoods of Los Angeles—tend to develop smaller, stiffer lungs.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">In 2025, the media will realize that harms from these tiny pollutants are even more profound. That’s because a growing body of science shows that fine and ultrafine particles, usually bound to toxic chemicals and heavy metals in wildfire smoke and exhaust, are causing brain injuries in children. Alarmingly, they appear to be contributing to the epidemic-like rise of autism and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9740780/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD), as well as increasing the odds of learning disability, behavior issues, and later <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/air-pollution\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/air-pollution\" href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/air-pollution\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dementia</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Why? Because these tiny pollutants don’t stop at the lungs; they invade the bloodstream and penetrate other organs, including the brain—which, like the lungs, is still growing and developing in a child, and thus more susceptible to harm.</p><p class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe iDXPAN callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">The evidence of particles’ neurologic impacts comes from brain imaging, histology, and epidemiology. We know that even before birth, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9553674/#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20maternally%20inhaled,human%20fetal%20organs%20during%20gestation.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">particles inhaled by pregnant women</a> can cross the placenta and injure the fetus; MRI studies in several countries have shown <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10410199/#:~:text=Further%2C%20a%20study%20which%20considered,volume%2C%20smaller%20corpus%20callosum%20and\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">altered brain architecture</a> in prenatally exposed children, many of whom struggled with cognition and behavior. After birth, particles can also penetrate the prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain behind the forehead—after being inhaled through the nose. When scientists studied the brains of children and young adults in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017593/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mexico City</a>, notorious for its bad air, they found fossil fuel particles, encased in Alzheimer’s-like plaques, embedded in the prefrontal cortex.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Evidence of a link to autism and ADHD has emerged in more than a decade of epidemiological studies from around the world. In a <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP10617\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">multiyear study</a> of almost 300,000 children from Southern California, for example, prenatal exposure to PM2.5 (the smallest particle regulated by law) was found to significantly increase autism rates. And a recent study of over <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-023-00065-5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">164,000 children in China</a> found that long-term exposure to fine particles boosted the odds of ADHD. Though autism and ADHD are complex disorders with multiple causes both genetic and environmental, it is increasingly clear that air pollution—caused by fossil fuels and worsening due to climate change—is a significant risk factor.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\nHumans have long wrestled with their conscience about killing and eating animals. The “meat paradox” (the conflict between people’s preference for meat and their concern for animals) may have inspired cave paintings from 37,000 years ago. Since then, many leading thinkers have eschewed meat, including Pythagoras, Leonardo da Vinci, Mary Shelley, and Mahatma Gandhi.\nToday, half of US adults and three-quarters of UK adults oppose the factory farming that produces almost all of their meat, yet only about one in 10 follow a meat-free diet.\nPlant-based diets are increasingly tasty and cheap in many countries. Adopting them would spare the lives of over 80 billion animals a year and would cause 75 percent less environmental damage than meaty diets.\nThe benefits of going plant-based on health and longevity are increasingly well established and have prompted an eminent cardiologist to remark, “There are two kinds of cardiologists: vegans and those who haven’t read the data.”\nDespite these proven advantages of a vegan diet, most people continue to eat meat, using strategies like “defensive reasoning” or moral disengagement and avoidance to reduce any psychological unease.\nEvery January since 2014, the Veganuary campaign—which encourages people to eat a plant-based diet in January—has attempted to break down these psychological defenses with pictures of cute piglets, fluffy chicks, and an invitation to give the challenge a go. Last year, around 25 million people, including about 4 percent of the UK population, joined in.\nResearch by Veganuary suggests that over 80 percent of participants maintain large reductions in meat consumption, reducing their intake to half or even more, after six months.\nAt the University of Exeter, we have independently conducted three online studies of Veganuary participants (a fourth is underway) and found that when people reduce or avoid meat they also start to see meat and themselves differently.\nMeat Disgust\nOn average, people report liking meat less, with some even finding it disgusting. This complements our earlier research showing that 74 percent of vegetarians and 15 percent of flexitarians find meat disgusting.\nAnother of our studies (under peer review) suggests that this “meat disgust” runs deep. Those who report it (mainly vegetarians) respond to the idea of eating meat in a similar way to how meat eaters react to the idea of eating feces, or human or dog flesh.\nPICTURE\nCaption: Meat disgust runs deep.\nCredit: Filip Obr/Alamy Stock Photo\nIf such negative feelings emerge when people avoid meat during Veganuary, giving up meat in the long term may not be quite the sacrifice that many would expect. We are now collecting data 12 months on from 100 people who participated in our Veganuary study last year and will see whether negative feelings toward meat predict longer-term changes in meat consumption.\nParticipating in Veganuary also appears to shift people’s identity from seeing themselves as a meat eater to more of a “meat reducer” or “meat excluder.” These shifts in attitudes and self-perception are associated with greater success in reducing meat consumption during Veganuary.\nSome other factors associated with greater success during Veganuary, and beyond, include increased feelings of personal control and improvements in practical skills and knowledge supporting a meat-free diet.\nSome of the difficulties that can hinder successful participation in Veganuary include having to navigate food choices in social settings, a lack of plant-based options when eating out, missing non-vegan foods, and the perceived inconvenience of plant-based cooking.\nSigning up to the Veganuary campaign to receive their daily emails with recipes, information, and top tips is helpful, as are the promotions on vegan food that supermarkets and restaurants offer during Veganuary.\nIf you’re concerned about swapping meat for plant-based substitutes that can be ultra-processed, recent analyses are reassuring and suggest these are often healthier than meat and are not associated with the increased risk of disease that comes with eating animal-based ultra-processed foods, such as sausages, burgers, and ham.\nHowever, if you’re a fan of beans, eating more of them is a great way to maximize health and environmental benefits while saving money.\nOur new study aims to provide additional support for Veganuary participants by helping them mentally prepare for common challenges before Veganuary and during the month. By collecting data before and after Veganuary and three months later, we also hope to determine which psychological changes are most predictive of longer-term reductions in meat consumption.\nIf you’re curious to see how giving up meat might affect you, why not give Veganuary a go?",

    "content_text": "This story originally appeared on High Country News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nThe more researchers learn about wildfire smoke, the more worrisome the picture gets. Smoke contains microscopic particles known as PM 2.5 because the PM (particulate matter) measures 2.5 microns or less—small enough to easily wiggle its way into our lungs and then into our bloodstreams. Researchers have already connected the particulate matter in wildfire smoke to a higher risk of strokes, heart disease, respiratory disease, lung cancer, and other serious conditions.\nAnd the harmful effects don’t stop there. 2024 was a banner year for research on wildfire smoke and its impact on health, from brain functioning to fertility. While there’s still a lot more to learn, wildfire smoke is thought to be especially insidious compared to other sources of air pollution; its smaller particle size, intermittent spikes, and higher concentration of inflammatory compounds make it more dangerous.\nThis year’s new findings are disturbing. But the more we learn about smoke, the better we can protect ourselves from it, whether we live hundreds of miles away from a fire or confront it directly the way wildland firefighters do. Research underscores the need for some changes, including better indoor air filtration systems in our homes, hospitals, schools, and nursing homes, and clean air centers for people with nowhere else to breathe healthy air. Meanwhile, respirators for wildland firefighters are currently being tested by the federal government. We also need to reduce smoke pollution at the source by taking measures to reduce wildfire risk and intensity, like prescribed burns.\nHere are some of the biggest advancements in scientists’ understanding of wildfire smoke in 2024:\nNew Estimates Predict 125 Million Americans Will Face Unhealthy Air from Wildfires by 2054\nWildfire smoke has erased improvements in air quality in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue. Millions more people will be exposed to unhealthy air in the coming years, according to models released by the First Street Foundation in February. It’s estimated that by 2054, over 125 million Americans each year will be exposed to “red” air quality, considered an unhealthy level by the Environmental Protection Agency—a 50 percent increase from 2024. California’s Central Valley will see the worst of it, with Fresno and Tulare County likely facing three months a year of unhealthy air, according to the study.\nSmoke Can Hamper Fertility Treatments\nThe fires that started over Labor Day weekend in 2020 blanketed Oregon with some of the worst air quality in the world at the time. Those 10 or so days of smoky air affected everyone, especially patients undergoing in vitro fertilization treatments, or IVF. Researchers at Oregon Health & Science University studied 69 patients who received ovarian stimulation and IVF treatment in the six weeks following the wildfires. Their study, published in the journal Fertility and Sterility in May, found that patients exposed to wildfire smoke produced fewer blastocysts—clusters of cells that can develop into embryos—than those who weren’t exposed. Most of the patients still got pregnant, but the study’s lead author said she is worried about how smoke may affect fertility treatments. She told the Idaho Capital Sun that, as an extra precaution, fertility providers may want to delay IVF or embryo transfer for higher-risk patients during times of poor air quality.\nWildfire Smoke Is Prematurely Killing People\nThousands more have died due to wildfire smoke than previously realized, according to a study from the University of California, Los Angeles. New research published in the journal Science Advances in June found that the fine particulate matter in smoke resulted in from 52,500 to 55,700 premature deaths from 2008 to 2018 in California. According to its authors, this is the first long-term study to assess deaths caused by years of increasing exposure to wildfire smoke in a state that, like other Western states, is seeing more frequent and more severe wildfires.\nSmoke Exposure Is Bad for Adolescent Mental Health\nResearchers at the University of Colorado Boulder found that wildfire smoke increases the risk of mental health challenges in adolescents. The study, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives in September, analyzed data from 10,000 preteens who participated in the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States, according to the university. Each additional day that the children were exposed to “unsafe” air quality readings in 2016 boosted the likelihood that they would experience symptoms of depression and anxiety—even up to one year later.\nYears of Firefighting Could Lead to Neurodegenerative Diseases\nLab rats aren’t people, of course. But in a controlled setting, they can offer useful insight into human health consequences. Researchers who exposed mice to an amount of smoke equivalent to what a wildland firefighter would breathe over a 15- to 30-year career found that they were more likely to develop brain disease than mice that weren’t exposed. The profiles of the animals’ genes fit a pattern that suggests long-term damage akin to the effects of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, and other neurodegenerative diseases. While researchers can’t prove that smoke is the direct cause of the heightened disease risk, lead author Adam Schuller told Boise State Public Radio that wildland firefighters need to be aware of the impact a long career in firefighting can have on the human brain.\nWildfire Smoke Is Linked to Dementia\nBreathing in the particulate matter in air pollution has already been linked to an increased risk of dementia. Now, researchers say, wildfire smoke may pose an even greater risk than other pollution sources. Analysis of more than 1.2 million people in Southern California found that exposure to wildfire smoke over a long period—three years, in this study—was associated with a higher risk of a dementia diagnosis. According to the study, published in the journal JAMA Neurology, the odds of a dementia diagnosis rose by 18 percent for every microgram per cubic meter increase in wildfire pollution over three years, a relatively small amount. For comparison, the average PM 2.5 exposure for a census tract near the 2018 Camp Fire in California was 1.2 micrograms per cubic meter between 2006 and 2020, spiking to an exposure of 310 micrograms per cubic meter during the actual fire.",

Officials believe the attackers are an as-yet-unidentified Advanced Persistent Threat group linked to China’s government that exploited flaws in remote tech support software made by BeyondTrust to carry out what the Treasury Department described as a “major” breach. The company told the Treasury on December 8 that the attackers stole an authentication key, which ultimately allowed them to access department computers.

WIRED found that someone has run thousands of ads for “fuel filters” that are, in fact, meant to be used as gun silencers, which are heavily regulated by US law. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has since removed many of the ads, but new ones keep popping up.

The lawsuit, Lopez et al v. Apple Inc., accused Apple of recording people’s conversations without their knowledge and sharing that data with third parties to serve advertisements. The issue stemmed from Siri’s voice-activation function—”Hey, Siri”—which two plaintiffs say surreptitiously captured conversations that resulted in ads for Nike shoes and the Olive Garden. One plaintiff claimed to have been served an ad for a medical treatment after having a conversation with his doctor. People who qualify as part of the class covered by the settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge in California, could receive up to $20 per device, for as many as five devices.\nAn Apple spokesperson said in a statement to WIRED that Siri was designed to be private and that “Siri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose.” As Reuters points out, the settlement amount is approximately nine hours of profit for Apple, which made nearly $94 billion in the last fiscal year. The company will not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the agreement, and the spokesperson said Apple settled “to avoid additional litigation so we can move forward from concerns about third-party grading that we already addressed in 2019.”\nFBI Unearths Historic Cache of Homemade Explosives in Virginia\nNewly unsealed court documents revealed that the FBI allegedly discovered during a search for a single illegal firearm the “largest seizure of homemade explosives in FBI history.” According to court records, the explosives arsenal was found at the Virginia home of Brad Spafford, where investigators allegedly found more than 150 pipe bombs and other explosive devices. Prosecutors say the FBI found a backpack containing pipe bombs and adorned with a grenade-shaped patch with the hashtag #NoLivesMatter—a potential reference to a far-right extremist “accelerationist” group, The New York Times reports. While prosecutors claim that Spafford—who allegedly used a photo of US president Joe Biden for target practice—aimed to “bring back political assassinations,” his attorney contends that he is a harmless “family man” who should be granted release\nChina’s State-Backed Hackers Targeted US Sanctions Office, Treasury Leadership\nFollowing revelations earlier this week that Chinese state-backed hackers breached the US Treasury in early December, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the hackers specifically targeted the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The attackers may have been looking for information about the Office’s possible plans to sanction Chinese entities. Additionally, Bloomberg reported on Thursday that the attackers targeted the computers of senior Treasury officials, where they were able to access unclassified material. Thus far, investigators have reportedly identified about 100 computers compromised by the hackers. Sources told Bloomberg, though, that the attack seems to have been more of a crime of opportunity than a clandestine, long-planned operation like China’s recent infiltration of US telecom companies.\nWhite House Chides Telecoms for Lax Security Following China Hack\nAs China’s Treasury hack comes into focus, the impact of its intrusions into American telecommunications firms is still widening. Two days after Christmas, Anne Neuberger, the White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, held a briefing with reporters in which she raised the count of telecoms breached by the Chinese hackers known as Salt Typhoon from eight to nine and suggested that at least some of the blame for those breaches lies with the companies’ own inadequate security. “The reality is that, from what we’re seeing regarding the level of cybersecurity implemented across the telecom sector, those networks are not as defensible as they need to be to defend against a well-resourced, capable offensive cyber actor like China,” Neuberger said. She added that the hackers had targeted the communications histories of fewer than 100 people—mostly in Washington, DC, reportedly including president-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect JD Vance. Neuberger said that the espionage incident calls for new Federal Communications Commission cybersecurity regulations that she says might have limited the scope of the breaches had they been in place.\nVolkswagen Exposed Location Data for 800,000 Electric Vehicles\nCars collect and transmit as much sensitive location data as any modern digital device, and the privacy pitfalls of all that tracking are becoming all too clear. Case in point: A whistleblower warned Germany’s Chaos Computer Club and the country’s Der Spiegel news outlet that Cariad, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, left exposed online a trove of 800,000 electric vehicles’ location data. The leak included cars sold by not only Volkswagen but also other brands, including Seats, Audi, and Skoda. For Audi and Skoda, that location data was accurate only to within about six miles, but Volkswagen and Seats cars could be located to within about four inches. The exposed data has since been secured, but the incident nonetheless demonstrates how far carmakers have yet to go to rein in their data collection.\nUpdated at 8:47 am EST, January 7, 2025: Added comment from an Apple spokesperson.",

The lawsuit, <em>Lopez et al v. Apple Inc.</em>, accused Apple of recording people’s conversations without their knowledge and sharing that data with third parties to serve advertisements. The issue stemmed from Siri’s voice-activation function—”Hey, Siri”—which two plaintiffs say surreptitiously captured conversations that resulted in ads for Nike shoes and the Olive Garden. One plaintiff claimed to have been served an ad for a medical treatment after having a conversation with his doctor. People who qualify as part of the class covered by the settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge in California, could receive up to $20 per device, for as many as five devices.</p><p class=\"paywall\">An Apple spokesperson said in a statement to WIRED that Siri was designed to be private and that “Siri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose.” As Reuters points out, the settlement amount is approximately nine hours of profit for Apple, which made nearly $94 billion in the last fiscal year. The company will not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the agreement, and the spokesperson said Apple settled “to avoid additional litigation so we can move forward from concerns about third-party grading that we already addressed in 2019.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Newly unsealed court documents revealed that the FBI allegedly discovered during a search for a single illegal firearm the “largest seizure of homemade explosives in FBI history.” According to court records, the explosives arsenal was found at the Virginia home of Brad Spafford, where investigators allegedly found more than 150 pipe bombs and other explosive devices. Prosecutors say the FBI found a backpack containing pipe bombs and adorned with a grenade-shaped patch with the hashtag #NoLivesMatter—a potential reference to a far-right extremist <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/active-clubs-telegram/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“accelerationist”</a> group, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/us/fbi-explosives-virginia-farm.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/us/fbi-explosives-virginia-farm.html\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/us/fbi-explosives-virginia-farm.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times reports</a>.

The attackers may have been looking for information about the Office’s possible plans to sanction Chinese entities. Additionally, Bloomberg <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-02/treasury-department-hack-said-to-involve-agency-leaders-computers\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-02/treasury-department-hack-said-to-involve-agency-leaders-computers\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-02/treasury-department-hack-said-to-involve-agency-leaders-computers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> on Thursday that the attackers targeted the computers of senior Treasury officials, where they were able to access unclassified material. Thus far, investigators have reportedly identified about 100 computers compromised by the hackers. Sources told Bloomberg, though, that the attack seems to have been more of a crime of opportunity than a clandestine, long-planned operation like China’s recent infiltration of US telecom companies.</p><p class=\"paywall\">As China’s Treasury hack comes into focus, the impact of its intrusions into American telecommunications firms is still widening. Two days after Christmas, Anne Neuberger, the White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, held a briefing with reporters in which she raised the count of telecoms breached by the Chinese hackers known as Salt Typhoon from eight to nine and suggested that at least some of the blame for those breaches lies with the companies’ own inadequate security. “The reality is that, from what we’re seeing regarding the level of cybersecurity implemented across the telecom sector, those networks are not as defensible as they need to be to defend against a well-resourced, capable offensive cyber actor like China,” Neuberger said. She added that the hackers had targeted the communications histories of fewer than 100 people—mostly in Washington, DC, reportedly including president-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect JD Vance. Neuberger said that the espionage incident calls for new Federal Communications Commission cybersecurity regulations that she says might have limited the scope of the breaches had they been in place.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Cars collect and transmit as much sensitive location data as any modern digital device, and the privacy pitfalls of all that tracking are becoming all too clear. Case in point: A whistleblower warned Germany’s Chaos Computer Club and the country’s Der Spiegel news outlet that Cariad, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, left exposed online a trove of 800,000 electric vehicles’ location data. The leak included cars sold by not only Volkswagen but also other brands, including Seats, Audi, and Skoda. For Audi and Skoda, that location data was accurate only to within about six miles, but Volkswagen and Seats cars could be located to within about four inches. The exposed data has since been secured, but the incident nonetheless demonstrates how far carmakers have yet to go to rein in their data collection.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><em>Updated at 8:47 am EST, January 7, 2025: Added comment from an Apple spokesperson.</em></p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Just a few days into 2025, electric vehicles are already having a roller coaster ride of a year. Last week, Tesla kicked off the bumpy trip when it reported that, for the first time, the reigning champion of American EVs had delivered fewer cars globally than the year previous. The automaker delivered 1.789 million vehicles in 2024, a 1.1 percent dip compared to the 1.808 million delivered in 2023. Tesla share prices sank 8 percent on the news.\nThen, on Friday, more annual sales numbers appeared, and the EV story got rosy around the edges. General Motors said it sold 50 percent more electrics than last year, with its Chevrolet Equinox EV SUV leading the charge. Honda’s Prologue EV, which went on sale halfway through the year, shifted 33,000 units—something of a coup for the Japanese automaker’s US electric debut. Even Ford, which said last year that it would back away from its plan to scale up all-electric sales in favor of a mix of EVs, hybrids, and gas cars, sold more than 50,000 Mustang Mach-Es.\nGlobal EV sales numbers likely won’t be fully collated till next month, but analysts say that in the US, electric vehicles seem to be on track for a pretty reasonable 8 percent of all car sales in 2024.\nSo maybe “roller coaster” is a bit dramatic. By many measures, the EV sales story—and even the Tesla subplot—is mostly playing out the way everyone in the industry thought it would. In the first part of the decade, “people thought there would be this crazy hockey-stick growth for EVs,” says Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. “That wasn’t realistic. The way we’re seeing the market evolve is more realistic.”\n“Everyone is continuing to move forward slowly,” says Corey Cantor, a senior associate who covers electric vehicles at BloombergNEF, of electric cars and their manufacturers.\nTepid Optimism\nNo one said the transition to electric vehicles was going to be easy. Electrifying “has been one of the largest changes that the auto industry has ever seen—and the auto industry doesn’t change overnight,” says Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, the automotive website.\nManufacturing a whole new powertrain—and sourcing the battery minerals to energize it—is just one half of the challenge. Changing people’s buying habits, especially for one of the most expensive purchases they’ll make in their lives, will be the other half. Given those constraints, “it’s remarkable that we’ve seen so much change,” says Drury.\nEven Tesla’s bump in the road might be seen as evidence that CEO Elon Musk’s automaker is doing something right. In 2006, Musk published his “Master Plan” that laid out Tesla’s “overarching purpose”: “to help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy, which I believe to be the primary, but not exclusive, sustainable solution.” Tesla’s annual growth challenges stem, in part, from the fact that the gambit worked, and there is now much more global competition in the EV space. Tesla officially lost its title as the world’s top EV maker last year to China’s BYD, which produced about 4,500 more electrics last year. (Tesla still sold more EVs, with a serious assist from Chinese buyers, who bought 8.8 percent more of the automaker’s EVs last year than in 2023.)\nWhether the global vehicle electrification project will stay on track comes down, in part, to policy. In the US, EV sales leapt in the last quarter of the year. This is perhaps because consumers heard about the new Trump administration’s plans to do away with electric vehicle incentives and took experts’ advice to buy new cars when they could still get subsidies. What will happen in 2025 if those purchase incentives go away?\nEven with more sales numbers to come in, 2024’s figures seem to show an industry chugging along as it should. “It’s a crazy transition,” says Brinley, the analyst, of the shift to electric vehicles. But she’s confident: “We are going to see more adoption,” she says.",

    "content_text": "Fable, a popular social media app that describes itself as a haven for “bookworms and bingewatchers,” created an AI-powered end-of-year summary feature recapping what books users read in 2024. It was meant to be playful and fun, but some of the recaps took on an oddly combative tone. Writer Danny Groves’ summary for example, asked if he’s “ever in the mood for a straight, cis white man’s perspective” after labeling him a “diversity devotee.”\nBooks influencer Tiana Trammell’s summary, meanwhile, ended with the following advice: “Don’t forget to surface for the occasional white author, okay?”\nTrammell was flabbergasted, and she soon realized she wasn’t alone after sharing her experience with Fable’s summaries on Threads. “I received multiple messages,” she says, from people whose summaries had inappropriately commented on “disability and sexual orientation.”\nEver since the debut of Spotify Wrapped, annual recap features have become ubiquitous across the internet, providing users a rundown of how many books and news articles they read, songs they listened to, and workouts they completed. Some companies are now using AI to wholly produce or augment how these metrics are presented. Spotify, for example, now offers an AI-generated podcast where robots analyze your listening history and make guesses about your life based on your tastes. Fable hopped on the trend by using OpenAI’s API to generate summaries of the past 12 months of the reading habits for its users, but it didn’t expect that the AI model would spit out commentary that took on the mien of an anti-woke pundit.\nFable later apologized on several social media channels, including Threads and Instagram, where it posted a video of an executive issuing the mea culpa. “We are deeply sorry for the hurt caused by some of our Reader Summaries this week,” the company wrote in the caption. “We will do better.”\nKimberly Marsh Allee, Fable’s head of community, told WIRED before publication that the company was working on a series of changes to improve its AI summaries, including an opt-out option for people who don’t want them and clearer disclosures indicating that they’re AI-generated. “For the time being, we have removed the part of the model that playfully roasts the reader, and instead the model simply summarizes the user’s taste in books,” she said.\nAfter publication, Marsh Allee said that Fable had instead made the decision to immediately remove the AI-generated 2024 reading summaries, as well as two other features that used AI.\nFor some users, adjusting the AI does not feel like an adequate response. Fantasy and romance writer A.R. Kaufer was aghast when she saw screenshots of some of the summaries on social media. “They need to say they are doing away with the AI completely. And they need to issue a statement, not only about the AI, but with an apology to those affected,” says Kaufer. “This ‘apology’ on Threads comes across as insincere, mentioning the app is ‘playful’ as though it somehow excuses the racist/sexist/ableist quotes.” In response to the incident, Kaufer decided to delete her Fable account.\nSo did Trammell. “The appropriate course of action would be to disable the feature and conduct rigorous internal testing, incorporating newly implemented safeguards to ensure, to the best of their abilities, that no further platform users are exposed to harm,” she says.\nGroves concurs. “If individualized reader summaries aren't sustainable because the team is small, I'd rather be without them than confronted with unchecked AI outputs that might offend with testy language or slurs,” he says. “That's my two cents … assuming Fable is in the mood for a gay, cis Black man's perspective.”\nGenerative AI tools already have a lengthy track record of race-related misfires. In 2022, researchers found that OpenAI’s image generator Dall-E had a bad habit of showing nonwhite people when asked to depict “prisoners” and all white people when it showed “CEOs.” Last fall, WIRED reported that a variety of AI search engines surfaced debunked and racist theories about how white people are genetically superior to other races.\nOvercorrecting has sometimes become an issue, too: Google’s Gemini was roundly criticized last year when it repeatedly depicted World War II–era Nazis as people of color in a misguided bid for inclusivity. “When I saw confirmation that it was generative AI making those summaries, I wasn't surprised,” Groves says. “These algorithms are built by programmers who live in a biased society, so of course the machine learning will carry the biases, too—whether conscious or unconscious.”\nUpdated 1/3/25 5:44pm ET: This story has been updated to note that Fable decided to immediately disable several AI-powered features.",

    "content_text": "\"It's time for THE charger,\" the European Commission posted to X on December 28, 2024. While the sentiment applies only to one continent (and not all of it) and only certain devices, the Common Charger Directive now in effect in the European Union suggests that far fewer gadgets will foist barrels, USB-micro, or proprietary plugs onto their owners.\nThe Common Charger Directive demands that a \"USB-C receptacle\" be equipped on \"radio equipment\" that is \"equipped with a removable or embedded rechargeable battery\" and \"can be recharged via wired charging.\" If it has a battery and can be powered by up to 100 watts through a USB-C connection, it's generally subject to the EU's USB-C requirements.

The firm stopped selling the Lightning-charging iPhone 14 and iPhone SE in the EU after December 28.\nIn addition to simply demanding that a USB-C port be present, the Directive requires that anything with \"fast charging\"—pulling more than 5 volts, 3 amperes, or 15 watts—enable the USB Power Delivery (USB PD) standard. This should ensure that they properly negotiate charging rates with any charger with USB PD rather than require their own proprietary charging brick or adapter.\nIn Europe, devices must indicate on their product boxes whether they contain a charging plug or mid-cord brick. A different label will indicate the minimum and maximum power that a device requires to charge and whether it can support USB PD or not.\nCan the EU Make Cables and Cords Get Along?\nThe EU's celebratory post on X is heavy with replies from doubters, suggesting that mandating USB-C as \"THE charger\" could stifle companies innovating on other means of power delivery. Most of these critiques are addressed in the actual text of the law, because more powerful devices are exempted, secondary power plugs are allowed, and wireless largely gets a pass. \"What about when USB-D arrives?\" is something no person can really answer, though it seems a vague reason to avoid addressing the e-waste, fragmentation, and consumer confusion of the larger device charging ecosystem.\nHow the Common Charger Directive will be enforced is yet to be seen, as that is something left up to member nations.

    "content_text": "In 2024, Elon Musk’s attention was focused squarely on the US presidential election. But in the early days of 2025, the X owner has turned his gaze toward the UK. Musk has feverishly spent the past few days boosting disinformation and divisive rhetoric on X about Muslim grooming gangs in the UK, posting almost 200 times, a WIRED review of the centibillionaire’s output has found.\nThese “grooming gangs” reference an organized child sexual abuse scandal that came to light in 2014 involving gangs of British Pakastani men who abused an estimated thousands of girls in several towns in the north of England over the course of several decades.\nMusk’s interest in this issue appeared to peak after a new report from right-wing news station GB News claimed the current Labour government has failed to protect the victims by refusing to sanction a government-led inquiry.\nDuring his three-day posting binge, Musk has called for UK government officials to be hanged and jailed, demanded the removal of Keir Starmer as UK prime minister, and suggested notorious far-right activist Tommy Robinson be released from prison.\nRobinson was jailed after admitting contempt of court last year for continually repeating false claims about a Syrian refugee that led to the refugee and his family receiving death threats. Musk has falsely claimed that Robinson was jailed for “telling the truth” about grooming gangs. Musk is also pushing the narrative that organized child sex abuse is carried out almost exclusively by Muslim men, when a 2020 UK government study found that was not the case.\nMusk’s flurry of posts and replies comes just months after anti-immigrant riots roiled the UK, fomented by far-right activists who spread misinformation about a knife attack.\nMusk’s posts, which have racked up hundreds of millions of views on X, are just his latest effort at inserting himself into UK politics. In the wake of his successful efforts to aid president-elect Donald Trump in the US election, Musk has turned his attention to supporting the right-wing Reform Party in the UK. The party is headed by Trump ally Nigel Farage; Musk met him at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in December. Musk’s public endorsement of Reform has raised questions in the UK about the potential influence of foreign donors on UK elections.\nA petition Musk shared in November calling for the removal of Starmer has so far amassed more than 3 million signatures, and over the past three days Musk has interacted with a wide variety of prominent figures about the grooming gangs scandal, including mainstream UK political figures like Farage and former Conservative Party leader Liz Truss. But Musk has also boosted content from extremist figures Carl Benjamin, who was a major participant in the Gamergate movement, and Tristan Tate, who is accused of human trafficking and rape and is the brother of manosphere influencer Andrew Tate.\n“They should receive the severest punishment, hang them for treason,” Musk wrote in response to a post from far-right UK lawmaker Robert Jenrick calling for the prosecution of government officials “involved in the Muslim grooming gang cover-up.”\nThe report that sparked Musk’s interest earlier this week claimed that Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips had rejected a request from a city council for a government-led inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham, a town near Manchester in the north of England that was one one of the areas where allegations of abuse from grooming gangs were made.\nWhile Musk and his allies claim this is part of a larger government cover-up, Phillips actually wrote in a letter that it was “for Oldham Council alone to decide to commission an inquiry into child sexual exploitation locally, rather than for the government to intervene.” The previous Conservative-led government similarly rejected Oldham’s calls for a government-led inquiry in 2022.\nMusk has called on Phillips to be jailed and called her “a rape genocide apologist.” Both Musk and Phillips did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.\nMusk is also using the report to call, once again, for Starmer’s removal as prime minister.\n“Starmer was complicit in the RAPE OF BRITAIN when he was head of Crown Prosecution for 6 years,” Musk wrote on X on Friday morning, in a post that is now pinned to the top of his timeline. “Starmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain.”\nStarmer, in his role as director of public prosecutions over a decade ago, actually initiated the prosecution of a grooming gang in Rochdale and introduced new rules aimed at allowing sexual abuse cases to be prosecuted.\nStarmer and the UK government press office did not respond for comment, but health secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC that Musk’s comments were “misjudged and certainly misinformed.”\nMusk has also drawn a number of right-wing US figures into the conversation, including accounts like Chaya Raichik, who runs the virulently anti-LGBTQ account Libs of TikTok, anti-transgender activist Riley Gaines, right-wing commentator Ian Miles Cheong, and disgraced former US national security adviser Michael Flynn.\nUS senator Mike Lee also weighed-in, writing on X: “Does the UK need to be liberated?”\n“Yes,” Musk responded.\nBill Ackman, a hedge fund manager and Trump supporter, repeated Musk’s narrative almost verbatim in a post on X. He then asked if the president-elect would “consider appropriate sanctions against the UK until these concerns are addressed.”\nIn a post on Friday morning, Musk boosted a call for King Charles to dissolve the UK parliament and order a general election. While the monarch in the UK does dissolve parliament ahead of the general election, it is only done at the request of the prime minister, and the monarch’s power is, in effect, nothing more than a rubber stamp.",

    "content_text": "Earlier this week, the California Highway Patrol sent an Amber Alert push notification to phones in the Los Angeles area about a 14-year-old girl that authorities believed had been abducted. But instead of conveying vital information that could help locate the victim within the notification itself, the law enforcement agency linked to a post from its official X account, a practice it adopted six years ago. But this time, many people reported they could not view the alert because they hit a screen that prevents users from seeing any content on X until they sign in to their account.\nThe California Highway Patrol told WIRED it was aware of the issue and had reached out to X for more information. “We’re looking into it,” Sergeant Dan Keane said. X did not respond to a request for comment.\nAmber Alerts are issued by local law enforcement agencies to help locate children who are believed to have been abducted and are at risk of dying or serious injury. In California, the California Highway Patrol’s Emergency Notification and Tactical Alert Center is tasked with issuing the alerts. The law enforcement agency told WIRED it has used X (formerly Twitter) to push out the notifications since 2018 without any problems, at least until this incident.\nOn other social platforms, including Reddit, Threads, and Bluesky, local California residents vented their frustrations about being unable to receive the details of an emergency happening in their community. “This should be illegal and everyone should be upset about this. If that alert was for my child and tons of people couldn’t see it because they don’t have a stupid X account, I would be beyond infuriated,” one person wrote on Reddit. “Why the fuck should a social media platform benefit from people wanting to be good citizens and informed about missing kids?” another asked on Threads.\nSome users reported they didn’t need to log in to see the California Highway Patrol’s X post, which was sent via a URL created using the Bitly link shortener service. It’s unclear what percentage of people who received the push notification were able to view the information about the missing girl and what percentage hit X’s log-in gate. Overall, only 21 percent of US adults say they ever use X, according to the Pew Research Center, not all of whom may have the app installed on their phones.\nAfter Elon Musk took over Twitter more than two years ago, the billionaire rapidly laid off the majority of the social media site’s existing employees and instituted sweeping changes to its moderation and verification policies. The shifts spurred concerns that Twitter would become less reliable for emergency communications. The incident this week in California suggests at least some of these fears were founded.\n“Requiring a login creates accessibility challenges and raises concerns about digital equity. Everyone should be able to access life-critical information, regardless of whether they use a specific platform,” says Amanda Lee Hughes, a professor of computer science at Brigham Young University who has studied digital emergency communications tools.\nPeople in Missouri reported encountering a similar issue in July 2023, when the Missouri Highway Patrol sent out an Amber Alert push notification with a link to an X post. Local residents similarly spoke out about how they could not see the alert unless they logged on to the platform. “It was quite a change” from how the alerts used to work, says Missouri Highway Patrol lieutenant Eric Brown, who works in the public information and education department.\nBut the incident ultimately didn’t prompt the Missouri Highway Patrol to abandon X as its go-to platform for Amber Alert push notifications. According to Brown, when X verified the law enforcement agency's account as an official government entity, the log-in issue problem went away, and the public could once again access its posts.\nSeveral of the California Highway Patrol’s official X accounts have the same verification badge as the Missouri Highway Patrol, including the one devoted specifically to disseminating active alerts statewide. However, not all of the California agency’s accounts appear to be verified, including what looks like the official channel for the CHP’s Southern Division, which includes Los Angeles county.\nWhen it was known as Twitter, X was widely viewed as an essential part of global disaster and emergency communications infrastructure. Government officials and agencies around the world relied on the service as a way to broadcast information about hurricanes, mass shootings, and other crises. Before Musk took over the platform in 2022, anyone could view public tweets in their browser regardless of whether they had an account on the site or had installed Twitter’s mobile app. (In 2015, the company reported that more than 500 million people visited Twitter’s site per month without logging in.)\nIn June 2023, reports that X had started locking content behind a log-in screen began popping up online. At the time, Musk called the move a “temporary emergency measure” that was put in place because X was “getting data pillaged so much it was degrading the service.” It’s unclear exactly what Musk was referring to, but that same month he expressed concerns about AI companies like OpenAI allegedly scraping Twitter posts without prior authorization.\nIt now looks like the decision to turn X into a more closed platform stuck. According to tests conducted this week, X has continued to limit what people without accounts can see. WIRED looked at several of its staff reporters’ X accounts without logging in, for example, and was only able to view a sampling of their popular posts rather than a comprehensive chronological feed. It does appear that accounts run by government entities are not restricted in this way; all of the posts shared by the California Highway Patrol’s alerts account can be viewed without logging in.\nAside from allowing anyone to view content shared on the platform, another way Twitter previously helped emergency communicators was by giving them free access to its API, which Musk later revoked. That allowed organizations like the US National Tsunami Warning Center to send automatic alerts about potentially deadly natural disasters. Researchers and first responders could also use the API to monitor activity across Twitter and “extract key insights, such as identifying risk hot spots or combating misinformation,” says Hughes. “The platform’s role has shifted as policies and public usage evolve, so its effectiveness today may look quite different.”\nDespite these drawbacks, X still remains an important platform for relaying information during emergency situations. In October, several government information officers emergency told PRWeek they planned to continue posting updates on X despite its diminished usefulness, because they had amassed large followings on the site and their priority ultimately remains ensuring that accurate information reaches as many people as possible. But the incident in California this week highlights how government agencies can run into problems when third-party services once considered reliable later change their policies in an unpredictable ways.",

    "content_text": "Thousands of ads on Facebook and Instagram have promoted “fuel filters” using videos demonstrating how they can be easily modified into gun silencers—a process that, without federal approval, could lead to felony charges. Despite Meta’s policies banning ads for silencers on the company’s social networks, the promotions have persisted for years, driven by what appears to be a single network of more than 100 Facebook pages marketing “fuel filters” that can be easily turned into gun silencers, WIRED has found. The devices sell for as little as $50.\nSilencers, also known as suppressors, are heavily regulated under United States federal law. Purchasing one legally requires submitting fingerprints, passing a background check, and paying a fee to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Federal law allows people to build their own suppressors, provided they register the device with the ATF. But the ads don’t mention this key stipulation, marketing silencers to buyers who may not understand the legal risks.\n“You know those things that are definitely not suppressors, even though they look just like suppressors,” a man says in a video that appears in many of the ads. “Well, but they’re still not suppressors, because they don’t have a hole in the other end. So, you can legally own one without going through the paperwork to own a suppressor, because it isn’t one.”\nThe ads often recycle the same text, referencing “light and durable air-grade aluminum,” and use videos stitched together from a handful of YouTube clips featuring firearms influencers and enthusiasts. The original creators of these videos are likely unaware their content is being used; one tells WIRED they had deleted the footage from YouTube years ago.\nOne ad features a suppressor engraved with the words Black Collar Arms. A co-owner of Black Collar Arms, who goes by Jeremy McSorely, tells WIRED his company has no connection to the ad. McSorely explains that the footage was taken from a blog and YouTube video he had uploaded years ago but has since removed. “The photos you saw were screenshots taken from my video,” he says, emphasizing that the suppressor was legally manufactured and engraved with their corporate information to comply with ATF regulations.\nIn November 2023, the ATF warned federal firearms licensees about marketing silencers as “solvent traps,” or contraptions purportedly used to collect gun oil and residue during cleaning. The agency clarified that legality depends on functionality, not what you call a product, and stressed that even incomplete parts intended for silencers are regulated under federal law.\n“The test for whether an item is a silencer is not the label a manufacturer or retailer applies. Rather, it is the way the statute written by Congress applies to the item,” the ATF wrote, referring to definitions of suppressors in the Gun Control Act and the National Firearms Act.\nA WIRED analysis of more than 2,800 ads revealed they are linked to a network of hundreds of ecommerce websites. These sites often reuse code, share IP addresses, and peddle the same low-quality knockoff products alongside the “fuel filters.” At least one of the sites was flagged by Google as a likely phishing scam.\nExperts believe the operation is based in China and relies on a drop-shipping scheme. “It’s likely just a reshipper selling controversial or illegal products,” says Zach Edwards, a senior threat researcher at cybersecurity firm Silent Push who specializes in online data ecosystems.\nTypically, Edwards explains, drop-shippers wait for a customer to place an order, then purchase the item from inexpensive online retailers, repackage it, and ship it to the customers. Edwards says that the operator behind the network is likely creating hundreds of websites, applying a moderate markup to the products, and spinning up Facebook pages to promote their items. “Even if some sites or ads get caught and taken down, others keep running,” Edwards says. “It’s a spray-and-pray method.”\nMeta explicitly bans ads promoting weapons, silencers, and related modifications. According to Meta, ads are reviewed by an automated system with support from human moderators. However, enforcement has been inconsistent: While at least 74 of the ad campaigns in our analysis were removed for violating the platforms’ terms, the rest appeared to have run successfully.\nAfter WIRED reached out to Meta, the company said that it removed the ads and associated advertising accounts. However, a quick search of Meta’s Ad Library revealed that nearly identical ones have since been published.\n“Bad actors constantly evolve their tactics to avoid enforcement, which is why we continue to invest in tools and technology to help identify and remove prohibited content,” Meta spokesperson Daniel Roberts wrote in a statement.\nRoberts says that many of the ads flagged by WIRED had little to no engagement, suggesting few people ever saw this content. However, at least two ads reviewed by WIRED had thousands of comments, including accusations that it was an ATF honeypot, complaints from self-identified buyers whose products never arrived, and even testimonials from others claiming the item worked as advertised. WIRED reached out to several commenters who said they had purchased the product—none responded.\nThe ads have also drawn the attention of US Department of Defense officials. An internal presentation to Pentagon staff, viewed by WIRED, claims that the targeted ad for a fuel filter had been served to US military personnel on a government computer at the Pentagon. The presentation, which a source says was delivered to high-ranking general officers, including the US Army’s chief information officer, raised flags over how social media algorithms are being used to target service members.\nMeta’s Ad Library provides limited transparency, leaving it unclear exactly how these ads are targeted. Researchers suggest that Meta’s powerful ad tools, which allow advertisers to find niche audiences using granular targeting options, could be exploited to reach gun enthusiasts or military personnel. While Roberts confirmed that Meta did not detect any indication that these ads were targeting the military, WIRED found that advertisers can easily target users who list their job title as “US Army” or “military” on their profiles—an audience that Meta estimates includes up to 46,134 people.\nMeta’s platforms have long struggled to prevent the sale of firearms and related products. An October 2024 joint report by the Tech Transparency Project found that more than 230 ads for rifles and ghost guns had run on Facebook and Instagram in nearly three months. Many of these ads directed buyers to third-party platforms like Telegram to complete transactions. In 2024, two Los Angeles County men were charged with operating an “unlicensed firearm dealing business” that used Instagram accounts to advertise and market the sale of more than 60 firearms, which included some untraceable ghost guns and weapons with scratched-off serial numbers. Both individuals have since pleaded guilty.\nSilencers are rarely used in crimes, but their use is on the rise—nearly 5 million are registered in the United States, up from 1.3 million in 2017. Last month, 26-year-old software engineer Luigi Mangione allegedly used a 3D-printed gun equipped with a silencer to fatally shoot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a street in midtown Manhattan.",

In 2025 it is likely that algorithms will continue to undermine the democratic conversation by spreading outrage, fake news, and conspiracy theories. In 2025 algorithms will also continue to expedite the creation of total surveillance regimes, in which the entire population is watched 24 hours a day.\nMost importantly, AI facilitates the concentration of all information and power in one hub. In the 20th century, distributed information networks like the USA functioned better than centralized information networks like the USSR, because the human apparatchiks at the center just couldn’t analyze all the information efficiently. Replacing apparatchiks with AIs might make Soviet-style centralized networks superior.\nNevertheless, AI is not all good news for dictators. First, there is the notorious problem of control. Dictatorial control is founded on terror, but algorithms cannot be terrorized. In Russia, the invasion of Ukraine is defined officially as a “special military operation,” and referring to it as a “war” is a crime punishable by up to three years imprisonment. If a chatbot on the Russian internet calls it a “war” or mentions the war crimes committed by Russian troops, how could the regime punish that chatbot? The government could block it and seek to punish its human creators, but this is much more difficult than disciplining human users. Moreover, authorized bots might develop dissenting views by themselves, simply by spotting patterns in the Russian information sphere. That’s the alignment problem, Russian-style. Russia’s human engineers can do their best to create AIs that are totally aligned with the regime, but given the ability of AI to learn and change by itself, how can the engineers ensure that an AI that got the regime’s seal of approval in 2024 doesn’t venture into illicit territory in 2025?\nThe Russian Constitution makes grandiose promises that “everyone shall be guaranteed freedom of thought and speech” (Article 29.1) and “censorship shall be prohibited” (29.5). Hardly any Russian citizen is naive enough to take these promises seriously. But bots don’t understand doublespeak. A chatbot instructed to adhere to Russian law and values might read that constitution, conclude that freedom of speech is a core Russian value, and criticize the Putin regime for violating that value. How might Russian engineers explain to the chatbot that though the constitution guarantees freedom of speech, the chatbot shouldn’t actually believe the constitution nor should it ever mention the gap between theory and reality?\nIn the long term, authoritarian regimes are likely to face an even bigger danger: instead of criticizing them, AIs might gain control of them. Throughout history, the biggest threat to autocrats usually came from their own subordinates. No Roman emperor or Soviet premier was toppled by a democratic revolution, but they were always in danger of being overthrown or turned into puppets by their own subordinates. A dictator that grants AIs too much authority in 2025 might become their puppet down the road.\nDictatorships are far more vulnerable than democracies to such algorithmic takeover. It would be difficult for even a super-Machiavellian AI to amass power in a decentralized democratic system like the United States. Even if the AI learns to manipulate the US president, it might face opposition from Congress, the Supreme Court, state governors, the media, major corporations, and sundry NGOs. How would the algorithm, for example, deal with a Senate filibuster? Seizing power in a highly centralized system is much easier. To hack an authoritarian network, the AI needs to manipulate just a single paranoid individual.",

    "content_text": "In the end, the return of net neutrality was short-lived: Today, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down rules introduced by the Biden administration that would have prevented internet service providers from favoring some apps or websites over others. It’s the conclusion of a decades-long fight for a more equitable internet—and a harbinger of what may await other consumer protections in the years to come.\nIt’s easy to get lost in the technicalities of net neutrality, but the basic thing the Federal Communications Commission wanted was the power to prevent broadband providers from engaging in bandwidth discrimination, slowing speeds for certain customers or to certain sites. Those protections existed under the Obama administration but were rolled back shortly after Donald Trump took office in 2017. You probably won’t feel much near-term impact; we’re largely back to the status quo, and Spectrum is unlikely to immediately try slowing down YouTube to get you to watch its own cable news channels. But that’s also why the way the Sixth Circuit arrived at its decision may be even more alarming than the ruling itself.\nThe three-judge panel frequently cited Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, the recent Supreme Court decision that overturned a legal doctrine known as Chevron deference. Under Chevron, courts were required to defer to regulatory agencies when it came to deciding how relevant laws should be interpreted when their provisions were unclear. Now, courts are free to decide for themselves. And the Sixth Circuit did exactly that.\n“Unlike past challenges that the DC Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC’s reading of the statute,” the ruling reads. “Instead, our task is to determine ‘the best reading of the statute’ in the first instance.”\nIn other words, the court substituted the subject matter expertise of the FCC with its own.\n“It's a sad day for democracy when giant corporations can forum-shop for industry-friendly judges to strike down some of the most popular consumer protection rules in history,” says Evan Greer, director of the digital rights nonprofit Fight for the Future. “The court citing Loper Bright here is an alarming harbinger of industry-friendly rulings to come.”\nAnd not just on issues affecting the broadband industry. The Sixth Circuit showed today how courts might use the end of Chevron deference to shape all sorts of policy, from tech to the environment to health care to pretty much any area where legislative ambiguity reigns.\nCritics of Chevron argued that Congress too often delegated the work of interpreting policies to unelected bureaucrats working for federal agencies, says John Bergmayer, legal director at the consumer advocacy nonprofit Public Knowledge. “Now we have the alternative: The first panel of judges to hear an issue can set nationwide policy.”\nThere’s at least one way out of this imbalance of power, Bergmayer says: Congress can pass a bill that explicitly says agencies have the authority to interpret laws. That seems unlikely, though, in a GOP-led legislature that’s wary of—or outright hostile toward—the administrative state.\nAfter all, Congress also could have codified net neutrality as the law of the land rather than leaving it to the FCC. Outgoing FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, still hopes that it will. “Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair,” Rosenworcel said in a statement. “With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law.”\nThat certainly would have been preferable to forcing net neutrality to ride on a political seesaw for the past two decades, passing in and out of favor depending on who’s in charge. (Former FCC chair Ajit Pai, who rolled back net neutrality rules under Trump, hailed the Sixth Circuit’s opinion as “excellent.”) But unless and until that happens, the regulatory whiplash that takes place when a new party takes power will only fuel the courts’ willingness to take matters into their own hands—especially now that they have a green light from the Supreme Court. “Applying Loper Bright means we can end the FCC’s vacillations,” the Sixth Circuit opinion says.\nThere’s some good news in all this. In 2018, California passed its own net neutrality law that, after years of legal challenges, fully went into effect in 2021. Because the internet doesn’t stop at state borders, California’s law does offer some degree of protection to everyone in the US. “California’s law is quite good,” says Bergmayer. “It’s just that something nationwide would be better.”\nWhich means, at least, that some net neutrality protections still exist. They’re not as comprehensive as digital rights advocates hoped for and not as strong as the FCC would have granted, but it’s something. But as courts increasingly invoke Loper Bright, that won’t always be the case. The Sixth Court has shown how easily consumer and environmental safeguards can now be erased in an era when it takes only one court ruling to make them disappear.",

Learn more.\nOver the holiday weekend, all but one member of the editorial board of Elsevier’s Journal of Human Evolution (JHE) resigned “with heartfelt sadness and great regret,” according to Retraction Watch, which helpfully provided an online PDF of the editors’ full statement. It’s the 20th mass resignation from a science journal since 2023 over various points of contention, per Retraction Watch, many in response to controversial changes in the business models used by the scientific publishing industry.\n“This has been an exceptionally painful decision for each of us,” the board members wrote in their statement. “The editors who have stewarded the journal over the past 38 years have invested immense time and energy in making JHE the leading journal in paleoanthropological research and have remained loyal and committed to the journal and our authors long after their terms ended. The [associate editors] have been equally loyal and committed. We all care deeply about the journal, our discipline, and our academic community; however, we find we can no longer work with Elsevier in good conscience.”\nThe editorial board cited several changes made over the last ten years that it believes are counter to the journal’s longstanding editorial principles. These included eliminating support for a copy editor and a special issues editor, leaving it to the editorial board to handle those duties. When the board expressed the need for a copy editor, Elsevier’s response, they said, was “to maintain that the editors should not be paying attention to language, grammar, readability, consistency, or accuracy of proper nomenclature or formatting.”\nThere is also a major restructuring of the editorial board underway that aims to reduce the number of associate editors by more than half, which “will result in fewer AEs handling far more papers, and on topics well outside their areas of expertise.”\nFurthermore, there are plans to create a third-tier editorial board that functions largely in a figurehead capacity, after Elsevier “unilaterally took full control” of the board’s structure in 2023 by requiring all associate editors to renew their contracts annually—which the board believes undermines its editorial independence and integrity.\nWorst Practices\nIn-house production has been reduced or outsourced, and in 2023 Elsevier began using AI during production without informing the board, resulting in many style and formatting errors as well as reversing versions of papers that had already been accepted and formatted by the editors. “This was highly embarrassing for the journal and resolution took six months and was achieved only through the persistent efforts of the editors,” the editors wrote. “AI processing continues to be used and regularly reformats submitted manuscripts to change meaning and formatting and require extensive author and editor oversight during proof stage.”\nIn addition, the author page charges for JHE are significantly higher than even Elsevier’s other for-profit journals, as well as broad-based open access journals like Scientific Reports. Not many of the journal's authors can afford those fees, “which runs counter to the journal’s (and Elsevier’s) pledge of equality and inclusivity,” the editors wrote.\nThe breaking point seems to have come in November, when Elsevier informed coeditors Mark Grabowski (Liverpool John Moores University) and Andrea Taylor (Touro University California College of Osteopathic Medicine) that it was ending the dual-editor model that has been in place since 1986. When Grabowki and Taylor protested, they were told the model could only remain if they took a 50 percent cut in their compensation.\nElsevier has long had its share of vocal critics (including Ars Technica’s Chris Lee), and this latest development has added fuel to the fire. “Elsevier has, as usual, mismanaged the journal and done everything they could to maximize profit at the expense of quality,” biologist PZ Myers of the University of Minnesota Morris wrote on his blog Pharyngula. “In particular, they decided that human editors were too expensive, so they’re trying to do the job with AI. They also proposed cutting the pay for the editor-in-chief in half. Keep in mind that Elsevier charges authors a $3,990 processing fee for each submission. I guess they needed to improve the economics of their piratical mode of operation a little more.”\nElsevier responded to our request for comment with the following statement:\nNot All AI Uses Are Created Equal\nJohn Hawks, an anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who has published 17 papers in JHE over his career, expressed his full support for the board members’ decision on his blog, along with shock at the (footnoted) revelation that Elsevier had introduced AI to its editorial process in 2023. “I’ve published four articles in the journal during the last two years, including one in press now, and if there was any notice to my coauthors or me about an AI production process, I don’t remember it,” he wrote, noting that the move violates the journal’s own AI policies. “Authors should be informed at the time of submission how AI will be used in their work. I would have submitted elsewhere if I was aware that AI would potentially be altering the meaning of the articles.”\nThere is certainly cause for concern when it comes to using AI in the pursuit of science. For instance, earlier this year, we witnessed the viral sensation of several egregiously bad AI-generated figures published in a peer-reviewed article in Frontiers, a reputable scientific journal. Scientists on social media expressed equal parts shock and ridicule at the images, one of which featured a rat with grotesquely large and bizarre genitals. The paper has since been retracted, but the incident reinforces a growing concern that AI will make published scientific research less trustworthy, even as it increases productivity.\nThat said, there are also some useful applications of AI in the scientific endeavor. For instance, in January 2024, the research publisher Science announced that all of its journals would begin using commercial software that automates the process of detecting improperly manipulated images. Perhaps that would have caught the rat genitalia figure, although as Ars science editor John Timmer pointed out at the time, the software has limitations. “While it will catch some of the most egregious cases of image manipulation, enterprising fraudsters can easily avoid being caught if they know how the software operates,” he wrote.\nHawks acknowledged on his blog that the use of AI by scientists and scientific journals is likely inevitable, and he recognizes the potential benefits. “I don’t think this is a dystopian future. But not all uses of machine learning are equal,” he wrote:\nThe journal Nature published an article in March raising questions about the efficacy of mass resignations as an emerging form of protest after all the editors of the Wiley-published linguistics journal Syntax resigned in February. (Several of their concerns mirror those of the JHE editorial board.) Such moves certainly garner attention, but even former Syntax editor Klaus Abels of University College London told Nature that the objective of such mass resignations should be on moving beyond mere protest, focusing instead on establishing new independent nonprofit journals for the academic community that are open access and have high academic standards.\nAbels and his former Syntax colleagues are in the process of doing just that, following the example of the former editors of Critical Public Health and another Elsevier journal, NeuroImage, last year.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.\nUpdate 1/9/2024 9:30 am ET: This story has been updated to include a comment from Elsevier.",

    "content_text": "This year will mark a turning point in humanity’s relationship with the moon, as we begin to lay the foundations for a permanent presence on its surface, paving the way for our natural satellite to become an industrial hub—one that will lead us to Mars and beyond.\nDeveloping a lunar economy boils down to three critical elements: the ability to get there, the means to refuel for the return journey, and profitable enterprises operating on the lunar surface. And, in 2025, technologies in all three areas will finally begin to take tangible shape.\nFor nearly a decade, the titans of private space exploration—SpaceX and Blue Origin—have been locked in a race to get to the moon. SpaceX's latest rocket, Starship, is central to this effort. At nearly double the height (121 meters vs. 70 meters), and three times the width (9 meters vs 3.7 meters) of its predecessor, Falcon 9, Starship certainly has the size—but it’s also designed to change how we think about space travel. Unlike traditional rockets, which are used once and then discarded, Starship can be reused for multiple flights and even refueled while it’s in orbit. Its increased power means it can deliver about 100 metric tons of payload to the moon in a single trip—that’s roughly equivalent to all payloads sent to the moon in history combined, but in just one go.\nTraditional rockets can deliver only about 0.1 percent of their total takeoff weight to the moon, but Starship, with its refueling capability, can deliver approximately 2 percent. Picture this: If a traditional rocket were a moving truck, it’d be like using an 18-wheeler to deliver one suitcase. With Starship, the cost per ton of payload delivered to the lunar surface plummets, making moon missions more affordable.\nNot far behind is Blue Origin’s Blue Moon lander. While it may be smaller than Starship, with a capacity of nearly 3 metric tons, Blue Moon is designed to deliver heavy equipment and infrastructure, the tools that will turn the moon from a barren outpost into a thriving industrial base. Together, these vehicles are laying the groundwork for a nascent lunar economy.\nIn 2025, SpaceX plans to demonstrate Starship’s full suite of capabilities, including its ability to refuel in orbit and be reused—slashing the costs of lunar transport and making the moon more accessible than ever. This is part of an ongoing series of orbital flight tests, which began in 2023 and continued through 2024, and will do so in 2025.\nMeanwhile, Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander is scheduled for its maiden flight in early 2025, marking a critical step in establishing the infrastructure needed for long-term lunar exploration and industrial activities.\nAnother major milestone in the race to the moon is scheduled for late 2025, when Nasa’s Artemis II mission plans to carry a crew around it, the first time humans have ventured far beyond low Earth orbit since the Apollo missions. This mission is a critical first crewed flight for Nasa’s Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System. It’s also a prelude for Artemis III, which will mark humanity’s return to the lunar surface in 2026.\nSupporting Artemis’ mission is the Lunar Gateway, a space station that will orbit the moon and serve as a key logistics hub for missions to the lunar surface. In 2025, Nasa will make significant progress on the Gateway by launching and assembling its first modules, including those that will provide power, propulsion, and living quarters for astronauts. The Gateway will be crucial for making long-term lunar exploration possible.\nGetting to the moon is only the first piece of the equation. A sustainable lunar economy depends on the ability to transport people and materials from the lunar surface back to Earth. The critical limiting factor for returning home is access to fuel for the return journey. The company I founded, Starpath, is creating the first “gas station” on the moon, with an end-to-end fuel production system on the lunar surface capable of turning icy regolith into rocket fuel. The three-part system involves a fleet of autonomous mining rovers that harvest the icy dirt, a processing plant that heats the ice to extract water, splitting the water into hydrogen and oxygen and then liquefying the oxygen, and a massive solar array that powers the entire operation. In 2025, we will demonstrate this technology at scale, enabling regular, low-cost travel between Earth and the moon—and beyond.\nAs these technologies take off, the moon will no longer be just a distant, desolate place. It will become the gateway to humanity’s future in space.",

This is part of an ongoing series of orbital flight tests, which began in 2023 and continued through 2024, and will do so in 2025.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Meanwhile, Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander is scheduled for its maiden flight in early 2025, marking a critical step in establishing the infrastructure needed for long-term lunar exploration and industrial activities.</p><p class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe iDXPAN callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Another major milestone in the race to the moon is scheduled for late 2025, when Nasa’s Artemis II mission plans to carry a crew around it, the first time humans have ventured far beyond low Earth orbit since the Apollo missions. This mission is a critical first crewed flight for Nasa’s Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System. It’s also a prelude for Artemis III, which will mark humanity’s return to the lunar surface in 2026.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Supporting Artemis’ mission is the Lunar Gateway, a space station that will orbit the moon and serve as a key logistics hub for missions to the lunar surface. In 2025, Nasa will make significant progress on the Gateway by launching and assembling its first modules, including those that will provide power, propulsion, and living quarters for astronauts. The Gateway will be crucial for making long-term lunar exploration possible.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Getting to the moon is only the first piece of the equation. A sustainable lunar economy depends on the ability to transport people and materials from the lunar surface back to Earth. The critical limiting factor for returning home is access to fuel for the return journey. The company I founded, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://starpath.space/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://starpath.space/\" href=\"https://starpath.space/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Starpath</a>, is creating the first “gas station” on the moon, with an end-to-end fuel production system on the lunar surface capable of turning icy regolith into rocket fuel. The three-part system involves a fleet of autonomous mining rovers that harvest the icy dirt, a processing plant that heats the ice to extract water, splitting the water into hydrogen and oxygen and then liquefying the oxygen, and a massive solar array that powers the entire operation. In 2025, we will demonstrate this technology at scale, enabling regular, low-cost travel between Earth and the moon—and beyond.</p><p class=\"paywall\">As these technologies take off, the moon will no longer be just a distant, desolate place. It will become the gateway to humanity’s future in space.</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nWith more than 97,000 fitness apps out there, according to the Health Works Collective, we're not lacking in options. Much of this can be credited to the Covid-19 pandemic, which turbocharged the rise of virtual fitness and at-home workouts. From virtual personal trainers to live yoga classes, each app claims to be the one that will transform your exercise routine. Add to that a sea of subscription models, performance metrics, and extra wellness features, and it's nearly impossible to know where to focus your energy. How do you know which fitness apps are worth your time?\nIf you, too, are overstimulated, we've rounded up a list of standout apps that cater to all fitness goals. Whether you're looking for structured workout programs, real-time feedback, or a bit of inspiration for the new year, we've done the heavy lifting to bring you the apps worth downloading. For more recommendations, read our buying guides to the Best Fitness Trackers, Best Treadmills, and Best Therabody Tools for Recovery. Also, check out our How to Work Out From Home and Everything You Need for Your Yoga Practice guides for more tips.\nUpdated January 2025: We added Peloton Strength+, Nike Run Club, Nike Training Club, Smash Your Fitness, Supernatural, and FitXR. We also checked links and prices.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nThe Best App\nPeloton\nI tried so many workout apps during the pandemic, but I, like everyone else, am now helplessly addicted to the Peloton app. Many WIRED staffers use the app in conjunction with Peloton's branded (and pricey) bike or treadmill. But as long as you have a smartphone or tablet, you can use the app with any spin bike, treadmill, or no equipment at all.\nFor $13 per month for the Peloton App One, you get strength, yoga, outdoor running, and gym workouts; for $24 per month for the Peloton App+, you get access to the equipment workouts (exercise bike, treadmill, and rower) as well as the Strength+ app (more on this below. The on-demand or live workouts have varying lengths and intensities, from 10-minute meditations to long outdoor runs, in addition to rides. You can load the app on a variety of devices—I have mine on my phone and Roku TV. The standout features are the sheer charisma of Peloton's instructors and the idiosyncrasy of workouts. (Britpop run? Country music strength training? Yes, please.) It's got a great subscriber base too. If you're wasting away from a lack of human connection, it's incredibly easy to text friends and family in different cities to show up in the same class.\nBest Running App\nNike Run Club\nI got into running in 2020 during the lockdown when it felt like my only excuse to escape the confines of my apartment. If I didn’t go out for a run, I might have just run through a wall. As someone who had never identified as a runner and has the attention span of a squirrel, the Nike Run Club’s guided runs kept me going. A coach pops in and out of your workout, offering tips, updates, or just a well-timed distraction. Sometimes, the commentary is a bit of a vibe crusher—especially when I’m bumping Brat—but you can toggle that audio feature off and do your own thing.\nI’m a huge fan of the running app’s training programs, too. They cater to all fitness levels, so whether you’re a newbie like I was or chasing a personal best, there’s a program for everyone. Recently, I tried the 14-week half-marathon training program just to see if I could do it. If you’re more of a treadmill runner, the app has options for indoor runs as well. Bonus: Nike Run Club is compatible with the Apple Watch, making it easy to track and control from my wrist. —Boutayna Chokrane\nBest Free Workout App\nNike Training Club\nI downloaded the Nike Training Club around the same time I started using Nike Run Club, and it quickly became my go-to for guided warm-ups. But this app offers so much more than just pre-run stretches. It’s packed with a variety of workout plans across categories like HIIT, strength training, yoga, pilates, and even mindset exercises focused on breathwork and meditation. Looking back at my activity history, it’s clear I love the quick morning routines and stretches. Like the Nike Run Club, this app also offers structured programs for every muscle group and goal—including specialized plans during pregnancy and postpartum recovery. You can choose from bodyweight-only exercises or sessions that require equipment, offering the flexibility to work out at home or in the gym. —Boutayna Chokrane\nBest for Weightlifting\nPeloton Strength+\nThere are a ton of strength training apps available. Most of them are designed for use in your home, and I've tried many of them, including FitOn and Workout for Women. However, I've found Peloton's independent Strength+ app to be the most flexible and enjoyable to use, as it's made specifically to be used in a gym. After all, that's where all the equipment is.\nYou can listen to your own podcasts or music while you work out. First, choose one of Peloton's programs, or use the workout generator to pick the length, intensity, and types of equipment that you want to use. It's easy to switch or skip exercises if you don't feel really feel like deadlifting right now or the equipment is being used, and your audio automatically pauses when you need to hear timers or instructions. You're not stuck pausing, fast-forwarded, or rewinding videos on YouTube. The only downside is that it's currently only available on iOS.\nIf You Miss Travel\niFit\nIt's unfortunate that so many fitness apps require proprietary equipment. But if you've got the itch to travel, I recommend iFit, which partners with NordicTrack, ProForm, and FreeMotion equipment. You get world-class athletic instructors with jaw-dropping natural scenery from all over the world for workouts that are both stunning and entertaining. I may not be able to ride a pump track with Ashleigh McIvor in real life, even if there wasn't a pandemic. But on iFit's platform, I laughed out loud from the exhilaration of flying behind her as the bike tilted up and down. I loved it so much, in fact, that my own mother bought the treadmill and has been enjoying her own global walks at home.\nIf You Own an Apple Watch\nApple\nFitness+\nSpeaking of proprietary equipment: If you want to subscribe to Apple's subscription service, Fitness+, you will first need an iPhone that's capable of updating to the latest OS. If you want to watch classes on your TV, you'll need an Apple TV, although you can also watch them on your iPad. Then, if you want to see your metrics on your wrist as you work out, you need an Apple Watch. That's a lot of equipment to start using what initially seems like an affordable fitness service ($10 per month).\nHowever, Fitness+ has added a lot of content over the years, which includes Artist Spotlights, a series of classes featuring the music from the likes of Usher and Beyonce, which is a welcome relief if you've noticed that the music in your Peloton classes just sucks. Fitness+ features workouts that support a truly insane number of sports, like snow season. If you already own one or more of the above devices, you can bundle Fitness+ in with your Apple One subscription (with the Premier plan, you get extra storage as well as News+ and Apple Arcade, and you can share your plan with up to five other people.) It seamlessly integrates across all your devices, and closing your Apple Watch exercise rings is still one of the easiest and most addictive motivational games I've used. I also really like the outdoor workouts, called Time to Walk and Time to Run, where celebrities can accompany you on your outdoor excursions (I've also heard these referred to as \"podcasts\", but oh well).\nFor Runners and Cyclists\nStrava\nOne of the most unquestionably popular apps for the \"aerobically inclined\" is Strava, which combines GPS tracking and an immensely popular social media platform for runners and cyclists. Strava is compatible with almost every fitness tracker I've tried too. Even multiple privacy issues have not stopped almost every runner and cyclist I know from using it. It's so popular it's spawned its own art form.\nIf you like riding, running, or exploring, Strava has a ton of neat features that will let you get outside and get some fresh air. There's a free version, but subscribing ($8 per month) gives you access to premium features like competing in segments on your routes, building your own heat maps, and accessing advanced training tools, in addition to letting you draw GPS-tracked penises all over your neighborhood for your friends' entertainment. Do you need new shoes? Don't forget to check out our guide to the Best Running Gear.\nBest for Gaming Cyclists\nSmash Your Fitness\nIf you're a cyclist, you probably have a trainer set up for what WIRED writer Robbie Gonzalez once called \"human hamster-wheeling.” If you find Zwift boring, you might want to consider a new cycling game called Smash Your Fitness. Cyclists strap on a “Smashometer,” a small, rechargeable ankle device that transmits leg speed to the game via Bluetooth, or directly to your smart trainer via Bluetooth or ANT+.\nYou cycle through a sci-fi universe that feels like you're suspended in space, while riding on a track akin to a revolving strand of DNA or a natural world that’s a compelling virtual facsimile of Europe or the Southwest. You can pedal with friends remotely or join paced group rides led by virtual ride leaders. A hunky AI coach can also spit out a workout program after feeding him some basic data. Pre-made workouts can be as short as five minutes or as long as several hours.\nThere are a lot of moving parts with Smash that a cyclist like me who just wants to get some quick exercise might not want or need. For example, cyclists have the option to “steer” the bike using their phone or keyboard. When this feature is turned on, there’s a risk of crashing, which I did at least 10 times in one ride. Throughout a month of testing I found that the app isn't quite easy to use. I never could sync it with my Zwift Hub smart trainer. The company promises that connectivity bugs will soon be worked out, but until then it’s up to the Smashometer to carry the ride. Also, the companion app is still waiting for approval from Apple and the Google Play Store.—Steph Pearson\nBest for VR\nSupernatural VR\nI have tried a number of dedicated virtual reality workout apps. (Nothing gets me sweatier than competing with my friends in Beat Saber). I also very much like FitXR, which recently added a game format called Seasons that's designed to jumpstart your workout routine over three months with unlockable challenges and experiences. (The Slam challenge, however, where you chase balls around your real-life room, nearly made me tumble into a lamp.)\nMy favorite VR workout app is Supernatural, which is available with a $10 per month subscription in the Meta Quest store. (You will also need a Meta Quest headset.) Supernatural offers three kinds of workouts—Box, Flow, and Meditation—in an immersive virtual environment that looks like Iceland, or the Alps. Flow is a pretty absorbing workout, as you duck and slide and swing your bats across your body to smash little balls, all while listening to Muse or Lady Gaga. Supernatural also started adding celebrity coaches; Jane Fonda recently launched a four-part workout series with her friend Ludacris. (Supernatural's words, not mine.) If you've ever thought, “Hey, I would like to work out with Jane Fonda while listening to hip-hop from the 2000s,” I would like to be your friend, and you can friend me on the Meta Quest so we can do a Team Workout together.\nA Beautiful Live Service\nObé Fitness\nThe Obé Fitness app offers a modern take on old-school workout videos. Once you've chosen one of the three categories—Sweat, Define, and Flow—one of Obé's coaches guides you through the workout. The coaches are energetic, lively, and encouraging and the music is on point, but one of the most noticeable differences is the background setting. Instead of the usual studio setup, the coach is framed by blank walls of varying colors. The hues on the walls change throughout the workout, creating a lively and dynamic feel to every session. It’s almost enough to distract you from how hard you’re working. —Billy Brown\nFor Adrenaline Junkies\nZombies, Run!\nIf you've ever thought to yourself, \"The only way I'd start running is if I had to flee for my life,\" you can now start practicing. Zombies, Run! is an award-winning audio survival game that's secretly a fitness tool. Once you connect your headphones and start your workout, an audio guide narrates your journey. In an apocalyptic, zombified world, it's your job to scavenge resources for your ragtag band of human survivors and evade death.\nThe app is free, but you can pay for the Abel Runner's Club version to access all eight seasons and features. In addition to heart-pounding audio storylines and narrated adventures, there are also virtual races, stat tracking, GPS-enabled maps, and the ability to connect with your Apple Watch or Google Pixel Watch. I have no doubt it's effective—I burned at least 5 to 10 calories just listening in fear to the YouTube trailer.\nFor Indoor Aerobics\nCrossRope\nIf you live in a region where you simply don't have the ability to go on miles-long jaunts and don't have the room to store a lot of equipment, you might want to consider getting a Crossrope. CrossFit is the branded fitness regimen-slash-workout philosophy that combines weightlifting, gymnastics, and other disciplines, and jumping rope is an essential part of the workouts (it's also just fun).\nOnce you have your Crossrope, subscribe to the app. The free version offers the 10 latest workouts, along with beginner tutorials and a beginner challenge. The paid version offers access to all workouts, along with challenges, workout filtering options, and a jump rope counting mode. There are also tutorials on how to do more complicated steps like boxer step jumps or double-unders, if you'd like to post a before-and-after montage to TikTok.\nThe Best for Yoga\nMy personal favorite online yogi is Yoga with Adriene's Adriene Mishler, and not just because we have the same name and own the same breed of dog. But in WIRED's offices, I'm outnumbered by fans of Yoga with Kassandra. It all comes down to personal taste—I'd say Adriene is more chatty and casual, and Kassandra more efficient and business-like.\nThere are plenty of online yoga instructors to try if neither personality quite gels with you. If Adriene cooing that a pose is \"yummy\" makes you cringe, you can also give Jessamyn Stanley or Yoga with Tim a shot. I also enjoy Cosmic Kids Yoga with my children on weekend afternoons. For more tips, check out our story on Everything You Need for Your Yoga Practice.\nMoving Meditation\nYoqi\nQigong is the ancient Chinese practice of using breath control and body movements to gather life energy (known as qi) and redistribute it around your body and back into the earth. It's also a great way to start your day on an energetic upbeat. Qigong exercises are done in a standing posture, and the gentle activities slot somewhere between Tai Chi movements and your favorite standing yoga poses.\nI picked up a daily qigong practice thanks to a series of videos by Marisa Cranfill of Yoqi.com. Her company's name says it all: Cranfill designs routines that are a combination of yoga and qigong, with equal emphasis on breathing, balance, meditation, and Chinese medicine. Also, the integration of yoga elements makes for an easier onboarding experience for those who are well-versed in yoga but new to qigong.\nThere are a bunch of free videos on Yoqi's YouTube channel, including a 30-minute video for first-timers. Start there. Once you're up to speed, a $15 subscription earns you unlimited video views on the company's website. Cranfill also has some fun audio meditations you can download for $15 to $30 each. —Michael Calore\nThe Best Dance Workout\nDance Church\nIf you miss walking into a club, getting your heart pumping, and thrashing your arms wildly around with a bunch of sweaty, ecstatic strangers, then Dance Church might be for you. The online platform offers crazy dance sessions led by real-life dancers, with a variety of bodies, dance styles, and (I have to say it) wonderful apparel. The company does lead live class in-person that are pay as you go, but a $19 per month on-demand subscription gets you continuous access to both live and on-demand dance sessions. This is a good option if you're fitting in exercise sessions with small children who think it's the height of both fitness and entertainment to jump up and down on the couch beside you.\nFor Everyone Else\nThe real workout hero app is a podcast app. If you're disinclined to do literally anything else, just grab a pair of wireless workout buds and meander around your block for a half-hour of fresh air and sunlight. If you're not sure what to listen to, we have many, many podcast suggestions here.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nMuch doom and gloom was aimed at the electric car world in 2024. But according to the International Energy Agency, electric car sales could hit around 17 million for 2024, accounting for more than one in five cars sold worldwide. The US has seen growth, with luxury EVs in particular continuing to sell well.\nBut the statistic of the year has to come from China, where EV sales have reached a tipping point as half of all new cars sold there can now be powered by batteries. Such is the rapid uptake of EVs in the region that it has shifted the views of oil forecasters, where decline in demand sees predictions of Chinese gasoline consumption dropping by 4 to 5 percent a year through 2030.\nDespite the incoming US administration's plans to end EV tax credits, and funding for charging infrastructure possibly being clawed back, the global drive toward EVs will only increase. And with that firmly in mind, let's take a look at our pick of the best EVs coming in 2025.\nRenault 5 Turbo 3E\nRenault is bringing back the iconic 5 Turbo, and in some style, too. The 5 Turbo 3E will be based on Renault's well-reviewed all-electric 5 E-Tech, only the front-wheel drive, 120-horsepower specs have been upgraded to rear-wheel-drive and a shocking 500 hp. This will result in supercar-worthy speeds of 0 to 62 mph time of 3.5 seconds to go with the pimped bodywork. Joyously, it's worth pointing out here that the image above is not a concept; this is the final production design. The bad news? These Turbos will be extremely limited and expensive, possibly north of $150,000.\nRange Rover EV\nIt's been a long wait. But finally we get to see what a full-electric Range Rover looks like. The answer is: very much like the ICE version, which is no bad thing. It will be the quietest and most refined Range Rover made yet, apparently, and crucially will match the performance of the V8 model, which means you should expect 0 to 60 mph in around 4.6 seconds. In November, Land Rover conducted prototype testing in the deserts of the United Arab Emirates, in temperatures exceeding 50 degrees Celsius, trying out new torque and thermal management systems. Pricing speculation sees a start figure around $120,000 and then up to $160,000.\nAudi A6 e-tron\nHitting the roads in February, the A6 e-tron comes in both Sportback and Avant body styles, and will be available in both the standard A6 and high performance S6 versions. The base model is 362 hp and rear-wheel only, then there's a 422-hp all-wheel-drive model. Finally, a 543-hp S6 e-tron will launch from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.7 seconds. Expect 350 miles of range and 800-volt architecture for rapid charging. In the cabin on the passenger side, an optional 14.5-inch display lets the non-drivers game or watch videos.\nBMW iX3 2025\nBMW’s well-received Vision Neue Klasse X concept hits production in 2025, and it will sit below the brand’s flagship electric SUV iX. Rumor has it that it will be given the iX3 badge. The concept car in this update to BMW’s design has a slimmer version of the iconic “kidney” grille, reversing a trend that saw the noses of BMWs getting larger and larger, almost to comic proportions. Hopefully this will make it to final production model, as this 2025 style has more than a whiff of classic Bimmers such as the 2002. An new 800-volt architecture (which is fast becoming a yardstick in EVs), should increase range by more than a third compared to the current model.\nHyundai Ioniq 9\nAfter the huge success that was the Kia EV9, it's hardly surprising that many have been waiting to see if this—Hyundai’s entry into the three-row electric SUV segment and built on the same platform as the EV9—was going to be as good, or possibly even better. There's a 215-hp single-motor base model as well as all-wheel drive version. Hyundai says it will give more than 330 miles of range from a 110.3-kWh battery pack in the long-range rear-wheel drive model, with charging from 10 to 80 percent in 24 minutes on a fast charger. The inside has “relaxation seats” in the first two rows, with the second row able to swivel round, plus an optional 14-speaker Bose system with 5.1 channel surround sound. Coming this spring.\nJaguar Type 00\nNow the cat's out the bag, the entire auto world has a view on the relative success or failure of Jaguar's reinvention as an exclusive, high-end luxury EV brand. Whether you thought the ad campaign was intentionally polarizing or just plain bonkers, the real test comes in 2025 when Jaguar unveils the final design of the Type 00 concept before production begins the following year. Expect the exterior to be much the same. Expect the interior to not be. Jaguar is stating at least 430 miles of range and the ability to add 200 miles in 15 minutes on a fast charger. We do know something on dimensions and pricing: The car will be more than 5 meters long, just under 2.5 meters wide, and 1.3 meters high—and you'll need at least £100,000 ($127,000) to buy one.\nGMC Sierra EV Denali\nTwo new versions of GMC’s all-electric Sierra Denali pickup land in 2025, both increasing the all-important range stats. The Denali Extended Range can manage 390 miles between charges, while the Max Range will supposedly be good for 460. Both feature 800-volt fast charging (seen in the likes of Kia and Hyundai EVs) at up to 350 kW for adding 100 miles of range in around 10 minutes. Zero to 60 mph is reached in less than 4.5 seconds. Air Ride adaptive suspension lets you raise and lower the truck up to two inches. But the real party trick? At low speeds it can crab walk; the rear wheels turn in the same direction as the front, allowing you to creep diagonally.\nZero XB\nNew for 2025, the XB is part of Zero's “All Access” initiative—essentially a scheme to make the brand's expensive electric rides accessible to more punters. Suited for both off-road and urban riding, it’s got removable batteries, switchable traction control, and factory-tuned suspension. It’s also Zero’s lightest ride at just 63 kilograms and, supposedly, its most nimble model to date. Perhaps the biggest boon is the XB’s 2.4-kWh battery that can be swapped out in mere seconds and charged up in just three hours. Range is 47 miles on one full battery, and top speed is 28 mph. All for $4,195.\nAC Ace Classic Electric\nAC Cars, Britain’s oldest active vehicle manufacturer, has an electric version of its classic Ace roadster coming next year, and it looks mighty pretty. Staggeringly, it weighs just 1,134 kilograms. For context, MG’s electric Cyberster coupé weighs a much heavier 1,885 kilograms. Carbon fiber bodywork keeps the Ace's heft down, so even with a 72-kWh battery and 300-bhp motor from TREMEC, it comes in only a shade heavier than its ICE sibling. That petrol version has a 0 to 62 mph sprint time of 4.6 seconds, and this electric promises to be faster still. AC says that the EV will be capable of 200 miles of range on a charge, and prices will start at a reasonable $275,000 with deliveries set to begin in spring.\nCanoo Pickup Truck\nThe run-up to the production of Canoo's cool Pickup has been going on so long that it feels like we have been looking at renders and images of the thing for decades. Still, it appears the brand's EVs will finally land in 2025. Currently being tested by the US Army (well, a modified version), the Pickup has 550 horsepower across front and back, and 200 miles of range. You can spec a 6- to 8-foot pickup bed, while fast-charging from 20 to 80 percent will supposedly take 28 minutes. The camping setup—complete with roof tent—has particularly caught our eye.\nFerrari's First EV\nThe world is watching and waiting for Ferrari to reveal its first fully electric car, and it looks like we will have to bide our time until late 2025 for the debut. It's been confirmed that prototype testing has already begun, and the inevitable spy shots show a crossover-like profile complete with fake exhausts, and nothing like the SF90 Stradale hybrid shown above. However, apparently, Ferrari was so impressed by the design of the Apple Watch, Jony Ive's LoveFrom design agency has been engaged to reimagine the steering wheel for Ferrari’s hotly anticipated electric supercar. We'll see how that turns out.\nXiaomi YU7\nWith its very first EV, phonemaker Xiaomi made the car Apple couldn’t. Xiaomi Auto's SU7, an electric sedan not dissimilar to the Porsche Taycan (and one that Ford CEO Jim Farley called “fantastic”), attracted almost 90,000 orders within 24 hours of going on sale in 2024. This likely makes it the fastest-selling car of all time. Now in 2025 comes the YU7. It has a similar style and identical wheelbase as the SU7, but it's been fashioned as an SUV that goes up against the likes of the BMW iX, Kia EV9, or Volvo EX90. Coming in June or July, the flagship will have all-wheel drive, torque similar to the McLaren Artura Spider, and a possible top speed of 157 mph. The battery can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in 19 minutes, and range is estimated at around 400 to 435 miles. Price could be between 250,000 and 350,000 yuan, which would mean $34,000 to $48,000.\nLucid Gravity Grand Touring\nLucid's upcoming EV is based on its Air sedan, and the company is billing it as an high-performance luxury SUV. Clever interior design has resulted in the overall length being shorter than an Audi Q7, yet it still fits three rows of seats into its cabin. Lucid claims range will be 450 miles with the dual-motor all-wheel-drive powertrain delivering a fast 3.5-second 0 to 60 time, as well as a towing capacity of 6,000 pounds. (That's only slightly less than the Ford Lightning.) Inside, a 34-inch curved OLED screen serves as both instrument cluster and infotainment screen. The $96,500 Grand Touring model will land first, with the $81,550 base Touring model arriving in the second half of 2025.\nMercedes-Benz G-Class G580\nFrom Arnold Schwarzenegger to the Pope via Britney Spears, the G-Wagon is the ultimate celebrity co-opted luxury off-roader. Famed for its power and pomposity, 2025 sees it arriving as a full-on, $168,000 EV with four electric motors combining to offer up a thumping 579 hp as well as 200-kW charging for the 116-kWh battery pack. This puts it on a par with its ICE equivalents, with 0 to 60 mph in just 4.6 seconds, and a top speed of 112 mph. But it’s the tank-turning G-Steering that sets it apart from the models that come before, resulting in 360-degree spins and acute turning circles that enhance its handling on off-road rambles.\nPolestar 5\nAfter a troubled 2024, Polestar has a new model coming in 2025. The Polestar 5 is an electric performance 4-door GT built on the brand’s first bespoke EV architecture. Developed by the Polestar R&D team in the UK, the bonded aluminum platform will house an 800-volt battery. Polestar is claiming it will produce up to 884 hp and 900 Nm torque, and be placed in competition with the Porsche Panamera and Mercedes-Benz EQS. Inside, expect materials such as natural fiber composite deco panels made from flax, and 3D-knitted upholstery made from recycled PET already seen in the Polestar 3 and 4.\nPorsche Boxster\nJust like the coming electric Cayman, the much-anticipated EV Boxster will ride on Volkswagen Group's PPE platform. Expect it to use an 900-volt electrical architecture for fast charging. Also expect it to offer enough on-the-road power to matches its gasoline-powered predecessors. While details are scarce, many are suggesting that prices will start at roughly $80,000. Spy shots reveal the Boxster EV will gain Porsche’s new-look headlight design, as well as an elongated wheelbase. Finally, a full-width LED light bar is on show at the rear, just like the other all-electric Porsches.\nTesla Model Q\nAfter speculation that Tesla's compact EV was to be scrapped, and despite Elon Musk dubbing the entry-level model “pointless” while instead backing the Cybercab, it seems as though a low-cost Tesla is back on track. It could possibly even come in at less than $37,499. Rumors of the return have been fueled by reports that the new model was discussed in a meeting between Tesla’s head of investor relations and Deutsche Bank. A Wall Street Journal reporter claims to have a copy of the meeting report, where it says the EV will be dubbed Model Q and will be launched in the first half of 2025.",

And with that firmly in mind, let's take a look at our pick of the best EVs coming in 2025.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Renault 5 Turbo 3E</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Renault</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Renault is bringing back the iconic 5 Turbo, and in some style, too. The 5 Turbo 3E will be based on Renault's well-reviewed all-electric <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/review-renault-5-ev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5 E-Tech</a>, only the front-wheel drive, 120-horsepower specs have been upgraded to rear-wheel-drive and a shocking 500 hp. This will result in supercar-worthy speeds of 0 to 62 mph time of 3.5 seconds to go with the pimped bodywork. Joyously, it's worth pointing out here that the image above is not a concept; this is the final production design. The bad news? These Turbos will be extremely limited and expensive, possibly north of $150,000.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Range Rover EV</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Range Rover</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">It's been a long wait. But finally we get to see what a full-electric Range Rover looks like. The answer is: very much like the ICE version, which is no bad thing. It will be the quietest and most refined Range Rover made yet, apparently, and crucially will match the performance of the V8 model, which means you should expect 0 to 60 mph in around 4.6 seconds. In November, Land Rover conducted prototype testing in the deserts of the United Arab Emirates, in temperatures exceeding 50 degrees Celsius, trying out new torque and thermal management systems. Pricing speculation sees a start figure around $120,000 and then up to $160,000.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Audi A6 e-tron</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Audi</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Hitting the roads in February, the A6 e-tron comes in both Sportback and Avant body styles, and will be available in both the standard A6 and high performance S6 versions. The base model is 362 hp and rear-wheel only, then there's a 422-hp all-wheel-drive model. Finally, a 543-hp S6 e-tron will launch from 0 to 60 mph in just 3.7 seconds. Expect 350 miles of range and 800-volt architecture for rapid charging. In the cabin on the passenger side, an optional 14.5-inch display lets the non-drivers game or watch videos.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">BMW iX3 2025</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">BMW</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">BMW’s well-received <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/bmws-vision-neue-klasse-x-has-a-car-wide-screen-and-a-joy-brain/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vision Neue Klasse X</a> concept hits production in 2025, and it will sit below the brand’s flagship electric SUV iX. Rumor has it that it will be given the iX3 badge. The concept car in this update to BMW’s design has a slimmer version of the iconic “kidney” grille, reversing a trend that saw the noses of BMWs getting larger and larger, almost to comic proportions. Hopefully this will make it to final production model, as this 2025 style has more than a whiff of classic Bimmers such as the 2002. An new 800-volt architecture (which is fast becoming a yardstick in EVs), should increase range by more than a third compared to the current model.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Hyundai Ioniq 9</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: ROBYN BECK/Getty</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">After the huge success that was the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/review-kia-ev9-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kia EV9</a>, it's hardly surprising that many have been waiting to see if this—Hyundai’s entry into the three-row electric SUV segment and built on the same platform as the EV9—was going to be as good, or possibly even better. There's a 215-hp single-motor base model as well as all-wheel drive version. Hyundai says it will give more than 330 miles of range from a 110.3-kWh battery pack in the long-range rear-wheel drive model, with charging from 10 to 80 percent in 24 minutes on a fast charger. The inside has “relaxation seats” in the first two rows, with the second row able to swivel round, plus an optional 14-speaker <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/bose-reinvented-itself-just-in-time-now-comes-the-tricky-part/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bose</a> system with 5.1 channel surround sound.

Whether you thought the ad campaign was intentionally polarizing or just plain bonkers, the real test comes in 2025 when Jaguar unveils the final design of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/jaguar-finally-reveals-its-all-electric-type-00/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Type 00 concept</a> before production begins the following year. Expect the exterior to be much the same. Expect the interior to not be. Jaguar is stating at least 430 miles of range and the ability to add 200 miles in 15 minutes on a fast charger. We do know something on dimensions and pricing: The car will be more than 5 meters long, just under 2.5 meters wide, and 1.3 meters high—and you'll need at least £100,000 ($127,000) to buy one.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">GMC Sierra EV Denali</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">GMC</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Two new versions of GMC’s all-electric Sierra Denali pickup land in 2025, both increasing the all-important range stats. The Denali Extended Range can manage 390 miles between charges, while the Max Range will supposedly be good for 460. Both feature 800-volt fast charging (seen in the likes of Kia and Hyundai EVs) at up to 350 kW for adding 100 miles of range in around 10 minutes. Zero to 60 mph is reached in less than 4.5 seconds. Air Ride adaptive suspension lets you raise and lower the truck up to two inches. But the real party trick? At low speeds it can crab walk; the rear wheels turn in the same direction as the front, allowing you to creep diagonally.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Zero XB</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Zero</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">New for 2025, the XB is part of Zero's “All Access” initiative—essentially a scheme to make the brand's expensive electric rides accessible to more punters.

It’s also Zero’s lightest ride at just 63 kilograms and, supposedly, its most nimble model to date.

Inside, expect materials such as natural fiber composite deco panels made from flax, and 3D-knitted upholstery made from recycled PET already seen in the Polestar 3 and 4.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Porsche Boxster</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Porsche</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Just like the coming electric Cayman, the much-anticipated EV Boxster will ride on Volkswagen Group's PPE platform. Expect it to use an 900-volt electrical architecture for fast charging. Also expect it to offer enough on-the-road power to matches its gasoline-powered predecessors. While details are scarce, many are suggesting that prices will start at roughly $80,000. Spy shots reveal the Boxster EV will gain Porsche’s new-look headlight design, as well as an elongated wheelbase.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIt's almost that time of year. Everyone you know will soon be hitting the gym, smiling while eating broccoli, or crushing out a last cigarette. For some, the gym really will become a new part of life, and that really will be the last cigarette they smoke. But most of us have probably experienced the letdown—perhaps even self-loathing—of failing to stick to a New Year’s resolution.\nI can't promise the advice I've collected will help—anyone who knows me would laugh hysterically at the idea of me guiding anyone toward successful habit formation—but there are some things you can do to set yourself up for success and make sure your resolutions become more than just that.\nUpdated January 2025: I've added some thoughts on the value of knowing why you're doing what you're doing.\nForget Goals. You Want Systems\nThe first and most important part of changing something in your life is to forget the resolutions and forget the goals. Think instead of creating a system that allows you to do what you want to do.\nThis advice is something I picked up from James Clear's book Atomic Habits ($14 on Amazon). If you find this article whets your appetite for a deeper dive into how you can create better habits, Clear's book is a great next step. It has plenty of suggestions about how to set up systems that work for you and help build the habits you want.\nCommon sense can take you a long way. As WIRED editor Adrienne So says, “reduce friction wherever you can.” Make it easier to go for a run by keeping your shoes by the door. Make it easier to eat healthier by filling your fridge with healthy food. “It's easier to work out every day if you've prepped everything beforehand,” So says. “Then you can run into the basement and do a 30-min Peloton strength video in 32 mins, instead of spending another 20 minutes looking for a clean sports bra.”\nIt also helps to be honest with yourself about yourself. For example, while some people might run downstairs and actually do a Peloton video, even that seemingly simple act presents enough friction to me that I'd never actually do it. This is why, instead of getting into Peloton, I have picked an activity with even less friction: body weight exercises. My body is always there, ready to go. I don't have to go anywhere or find anything. I just start exercising.\nWhich is to say, if you have to rely on the power of your iron will, just gritting your teeth and toughing it out (which isn't actually your will, that's your will in conflict with itself, but never mind that), you're unlikely to turn it into a habit. That doesn't mean there won't be moments when whatever you're doing isn't hard, but it shouldn't be hard to start.\nProgress Incrementally\nWIRED director and podcast host Michael Calore suggests the app Couch to 5K to anyone who wants to build a running habit. It's a great app; stick with the personal trainer voices to keep you motivated. But you know what it won't have you do? Run a 5K on the first day you use it.\nThis goes along with the previous suggestion to ditch the goals. It takes a while to develop the strength and stamina to run 5 kilometers. If you're going to be disappointed every time you don't run 5K, that's not going to make you want to keep running.\nThe far better, and more encouraging, plan is to run a little bit more today than you did yesterday. No matter what your system is, do a little bit more than last time, even if it's only a tiny bit more. Read 21 pages instead of 20 pages, walk for 11 minutes instead of 10, and so on. Incremental progress is the goal.\nIncremental progress is part of the reason I don't take days off from new habits, and I recommend you don't either, at least for the first 90 days. Your body could benefit from rest days if your habit is exercise-related, but if your new habit doesn't require physical exertion, don't stop for the first 90 days. Depending on which study you want to cite, it takes anywhere between 60 to 243 days to build a new habit. I've had good luck with about 90, and I strongly recommend you go at least that long on your first try.\nOn the internet of yore, there was an apocryphal story about Jerry Seinfeld supposedly giving advice to software developer and would-be comedian Brad Isaac. Isaac asked him if he had any tips on becoming a comic. Seinfeld's answer amounts to, well, build a habit of writing jokes.\nThat's fairly obvious, but Seinfeld had a technique. He reportedly told Isaac to get a big wall calendar and said every time he sat down and did the work, he should make a big X over that day. “After a few days, you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.”\nEven if it's apocryphal, it's still excellent advice. It also sounds like something a Seinfeld character would say.\nReduce Friction Even More\nOne of the reasons we have trouble changing our habits is that we're highly emotionally invested in the habits we have. I like doing nothing in the morning. I don't want to read/workout/cook/etc. Overcoming this inertia and resistance to change is difficult, especially since this resistance is often not entirely conscious.\nThis is partly why I have avoided suggestions about stopping habits you don't like (grab Clear's book if you're interested in stopping a bad habit; he has plenty of good advice on that score) and focused on creating new habits. There's generally less emotional baggage.\nBut what if you could reduce your emotional baggage? That way, you could stop focusing on specific habits and train your will instead. This is a common theme in older texts ranging from Catholic meditation guides to the New Thought Movement of the early 20th century.\nThe will is like a muscle, and you need to build it up through strength training. I've seen countless versions of this exercise, but they all go something like this: Sit down in a chair facing a wall. Pick a spot on the wall. Get up out of the chair and go touch the spot in the wall. Return to the chair and sit down again. Rinse and repeat. Most books tell you to start out doing this 10 times and work your way up from there.\nThere are more interesting, fun variations on this idea—I know someone who would pick a random spot on the map, figure out how to use public transportation to get there, and then go to that spot at a specific time of the day—but the general idea is to will yourself to do something, but something you have no emotional investment in. This builds up a fortitude of the will that you can then apply to things you are emotionally invested in.\nOut With the Old\nThis is the time of year when we focus on new beginnings (natch), but it's also worth spending some time reevaluating old commitments to see if you're still actually committed to them. This is one of the most useful lessons I took from David Allen's organizational classic Getting Things Done ($16, Amazon). Allen refers to everything you have to do, or want to do, as an “open loop.” Open loops, no matter how small, take up some space in our brain. That's space that you can't use for other things. So any time you can close one of those loops you get a little bit of energy back. As anyone who has done the exercises in Allen's book can tell you, there really is something very energizing about clearing your mind of all those loops (not only by doing them, but more importantly, by making a decision about what to do with them).\nThis applies not just to things you have to do, but also things you think you want to do. Maybe you think you should learn Spanish, but you haven't done anything to actually learn Spanish. Admitting that you aren't actually committed to the idea enough to do the work of learning Spanish can help close that loop. Letting go of that feeling that you should learn Spanish just might be the thing that frees up your mind enough that you decide to take up paddleboarding on a whim. The point is that the new year isn't just a time for starting something new. It's a time to let go of the things from that past that are no longer serving you.\nIn many ways this is the antidote to that ever-so-popular slogan “Just do it.” Just do it implies that you shouldn't think about it, instead of deciding what you really want to do or should do. Maybe spend some time remembering why you wanted to do it in the first place, and if those reasons no longer resonate with you, just don't do it.\nIf you like this idea, I highly recommend getting Allen's book. It goes into much more detail on this idea and has some practical advice on letting go. You can still keep track of those things, in case you do decide, years from now, when you're paddleboarding through the Sea of Cortez, that now you really do want to learn Spanish and are willing to do the work.\nRemember to Live\nI will confess, my enthusiasm for Getting Things Done has waned over the years. Not because the system doesn't work, but because I have found my life more dramatically improved by doing less, not more. It's not that I've stopped getting things done. It's that I've found many of the things I felt like I should do were not really my idea; they were ideas I'd internalized from other places. I didn't really want to do them, so I didn't, then I felt guilty about it.\nWhile everything I've written above remains good advice for starting a healthy habit and keeping it going, it's worth spending some time and making sure you know why you want to do what you're doing. I have been rereading Bertrand Russell’s In Praise of Idleness, and this line jumped out at me: “The modern man thinks that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its own sake.”\nIn the case of habits, I think it's worth considering whether you want to start a habit because you love whatever the habit is or because you think you should because it will make you happier or healthier or more successful. Doing things because you genuinely love them for their own sake is much more likely to lead to success.\nDo the Work\nAs one of my writing professors used to say, to be a writer you have to park your butt in a chair and actually write. To be a yogi, you have to do yoga. To run, you have to run. There's no easy way around it. You have to put on your grown-up pants and do the work.\nHowever, on the flip side, as Clear points out early on in Atomic Habits, the way to change who you are is to change what you do. “Each time you write a page, you are a writer. Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician. Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.” Each time you do the work, you become the future self you want to be.",

    "content_text": "If you're worried about possible expansions of government surveillance and access to your information, or simply want to do some digital purging so you're not saddled with old data, there are a bunch of concrete steps you can take to protect your digital privacy. Just as archeologists study carefully preserved tombs and ancient trash heaps to gain insight into historic communities, your long-forgotten digital footprint could be more revealing and sensitive than you realize. And while you can't control everything—particularly information stolen in breaches or gathered by data brokers—you probably have a digital attic full of old data that you can delete or download and save offline. First stop? Old message histories.\nChats are a good place to start your digital decluttering. Their real-time nature makes it easy to forget that if you don't have auto-delete turned on for a chat (or if a platform doesn't offer it), all of those “be there in 10 minutes,” “wait, what color is this dress???” and “welp, I have covid” messages are still knocking around years later. If you sent them on an end-to-end encrypted platform like Signal or WhatsApp, they only exist on your device and the devices of the other person or people you were chatting with. That means that for governments or bad actors to read them, they would need direct control of your device—a good level of protection, though not foolproof.\nCrucially, though, messages that you sent on regular web apps like Slack, Facebook Messenger for most of its history, and Google Chat/Hangouts/Gchat are sitting on a cloud server somewhere. And while they're probably stored in an encrypted form to protect against theft, the platform itself has the keys to decrypt your data and would be able to comply with government requests for it, no matter how old the information is. Sure, all of those “u up?\"s may not seem significant now, but years and years of chat histories can paint a very detailed picture of your life, associations, political beliefs, and past movements and activity.\n“Doing a good digital cleaning from time to time is a great habit, especially with social media and old chat messages,” says Kenn White, security principal at the database developer MongoDB and director of the Open Crypto Audit Project. “Who you were five or 10 years ago is probably very different than who you are today, so it's worth asking yourself, ‘Do I really need those seven-year-old inside jokes and sarcastic posts? Do I need to keep old group chat messages and carry them forward to every new phone I get?’”\nSome programs like Apple's Messages make it easy to auto-delete your chat histories after a set period of time. On iOS, go to Settings > Apps > Messages and then scroll and tap Keep Messages. Then choose whether to keep messages forever, for one year, or for 30 days before auto-deleting.\nOn the free version of Slack, data older than a year is automatically deleted. The company keeps data forever on paid plans, unless the administrator sets up rolling deletion. This is useful if you have an active Slack with your friends, but most people who use Slack at work don't make decisions about administrative policies and can't control deletion. Keep this in mind for any communication you do on an employer's platforms. You may be able to go through and delete messages or files one by one, but you likely won't have the access to make policy decisions about automatic or batch deletion.\nSimilarly, you may want to go through your chats on Android or iOS and delete old SMS conversations. Meta's Messenger now offers auto-delete options, but for your existing chats, you have to go down the list on desktop or in the Messenger mobile app and delete chats one by one. Meta's other chat platforms, Instagram Chat and WhatsApp, are similar, except that WhatsApp has been end-to-end encrypted since 2016 instead of adding the protection recently.\nConsider whether you've spent time chatting on other social platforms as well. X, for example, has been through a lot of changes since Elon Musk bought Twitter more than two years ago and took the company private again. Musk promised that he would add end-to-end encryption to DMs on X, and eventually debuted an opt-in encryption feature with the paid tier of the platform, but the company doesn't definitively say that the tool offers full end-to-end encryption and it isn't open source for vetting. You can delete individual messages or go through your chat list and delete whole DM conversations if you want to pare down the data you're keeping on the platform.\nIf you've had Gmail for a long time, the messenger service “Google Talk,” once colloquially known as “Gchat,” may have a special place in your heart. And perhaps, over the years, you went through the saga in which Gchat—which was once known for interoperability with platforms like AIM—became the siloed Google chat platform Hangouts, and then transformed again into what is now called Google Chat. Your chats on this platform through the years are still hanging around, but they're not all in the same place.\nThe crucial thing to understand is that Gchat was fully integrated with Gmail and wasn't a separate platform, so your chat histories all saved in your mail archive. To find them now, open Gmail and search for the phrase in:chats (using no quotation marks). Hundreds or thousands of chats from May 2013 and earlier may pop up. They must be deleted directly from Gmail. After May 2013, Google migrated Gchat users to Hangouts, and that history has come forward into what is now Google Chat, so you can delete whole chats or individual messages there.\n“Messages sent and received with history on in Google Talk from before May 2013 (the time when Google Hangouts launched) are stored in Gmail under the ‘in:chats’ label. Those messages are not available in Google Chat and can be deleted directly from Gmail only,” Google spokesperson Ross Richendrfer tells WIRED. “In terms of Hangouts data—which was merged with Chat—core Chat controls (including deletion) will work.”\nThere are lots of other chat apps to consider, too, where old messages may still be lurking. Think about Skype chat or GroupMe. And there's one other complicating factor when you declutter your messages: Most deletion features only delete data from your account, and the messages live on in the accounts of the person or people you were chatting with. To do a total digital detox you need to recruit your community to delete their message archives as well.\nAdditionally, you may feel sentimental about burning your letters (aka deleting all of your old chats). If you're sad about hitting that trash icon, consider downloading chat histories with your closest friends or other loved ones and storing them on an encrypted external hard drive before deleting them from the cloud. This way, you don't have to give up that slice of life completely, but the data isn't controlled by other entities anymore.\n“Some apps, including Signal, give one the ability to set a ‘self-destruct’ time on messages, perhaps in hours or weeks. This is worth considering to reduce your exposure, particularly if you travel outside the country, are politically active, or in any way have a higher public profile,” MongoDB's White says. “It's easy to dismiss the potential of attacks on our personal data and physical safety as something that's only a concern for some James Bond–type scenarios, but the hard truth is that threats exist in many forms, both online and in person.”",

Musk promised that he would add end-to-end encryption to DMs on X, and eventually <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-encrypted-dm-signal-whatsapp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">debuted an opt-in encryption feature</a> with the paid tier of the platform, but the company doesn't definitively say that the tool offers full end-to-end encryption and it isn't open source for vetting. You can delete individual messages or go through your chat list and delete whole DM conversations if you want to pare down the data you're keeping on the platform.</p><p class=\"paywall\">If you've had Gmail for a long time, the messenger service “Google Talk,” once colloquially known as “Gchat,” may have a special place in your heart. And perhaps, over the years, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://slate.com/technology/2016/05/gchat-was-the-future-of-messaging-why-did-google-make-other-chat-products.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://slate.com/technology/2016/05/gchat-was-the-future-of-messaging-why-did-google-make-other-chat-products.html\" href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2016/05/gchat-was-the-future-of-messaging-why-did-google-make-other-chat-products.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">you went through the saga</a> in which Gchat—which was once known for interoperability with platforms like AIM—became the siloed Google chat platform Hangouts, and then transformed again into what is now called Google Chat. Your chats on this platform through the years are still hanging around, but they're not all in the same place.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The crucial thing to understand is that Gchat was fully integrated with Gmail and wasn't a separate platform, so your chat histories all saved in your mail archive. To find them now, open Gmail and <strong>search for the phrase in:chats</strong> (using no quotation marks). Hundreds or thousands of chats from May 2013 and earlier may pop up. They must be deleted directly from Gmail. After May 2013, Google migrated Gchat users to Hangouts, and that history has come forward into what is now Google Chat, so you can delete whole chats or individual messages there.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“Messages sent and received with history on in Google Talk from before May 2013 (the time when Google Hangouts launched) are stored in Gmail under the ‘in:chats’ label. Those messages are not available in Google Chat and can be deleted directly from Gmail only,” Google spokesperson Ross Richendrfer tells WIRED. “In terms of Hangouts data—which was merged with Chat—core Chat controls (including deletion) will work.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">There are lots of other chat apps to consider, too, where old messages may still be lurking. Think about Skype chat or GroupMe. And there's one other complicating factor when you declutter your messages: Most deletion features only delete data from your account, and the messages live on in the accounts of the person or people you were chatting with. To do a total digital detox you need to recruit your community to delete their message archives as well.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Additionally, you may feel sentimental about burning your letters (aka deleting all of your old chats). If you're sad about hitting that trash icon, consider downloading chat histories with your closest friends or other loved ones and storing them on an encrypted external hard drive before deleting them from the cloud. This way, you don't have to give up that slice of life completely, but the data isn't controlled by other entities anymore.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“Some apps, including Signal, give one the ability to set a ‘self-destruct’ time on messages, perhaps in hours or weeks. This is worth considering to reduce your exposure, particularly if you travel outside the country, are politically active, or in any way have a higher public profile,” MongoDB's White says. “It's easy to dismiss the potential of attacks on our personal data and physical safety as something that's only a concern for some James Bond–type scenarios, but the hard truth is that threats exist in many forms, both online and in person.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Whether it’s for work, convenience, connection or entertainment, we rely on digital technology. But the prevailing wisdom is that our screen-based lives are not good for us—that our digital devices and apps are addictive and harmful, wrecking attention span, sleep, and more. However, research suggests screen time isn’t actually the driving force behind declines in mental health. Instead, digital technology is one component within an ecosystem of factors.\nNevertheless, it’s clear we could have a better relationships with our screen-based tech. Let’s think about how.\nStop Worrying About Screen “Time”\nHow much we use our devices isn’t as helpful as thinking about the types of content we’re consuming, the context in which we’re consuming it, and why we’re consuming it. Some researchers suggest we think in terms of a “digital diet.\" When we consider our diet, we don’t ask “how much food is too much.” Instead, we look at the range of foods; how they interact with each other; when we’re eating; whether we exercise or not; what we need versus what we want. Similarly, different types of screen time can have different potential effects on our well-being. If used in the right way, our digital devices can offer us numerous situational benefits and conveniences, whereas at the wrong time or circumstance, using them isn’t positive.\nThink Screen Habits, Not Addictions\nYou are not addicted to your smartphone, or to social media. When we fall into this way of thinking, we focus on technology use exclusively in terms of negative effects, and the only solutions focus on abstinence. Instead, research points to a more useful way of framing our technology use—in terms of habit formation—that can offer us more effective tools for making positive change. What does the landscape of our digital technology use look like? What do we enjoy using our phones for? Are we using our screens intentionally, or have we developed more mindless, less fruitful habits? If we shift our thinking toward this more nuanced approach, we can move beyond simple “digital detox” to curate a better experience.\nAssess Your Screen Habits\nBeing more intentional about screen use won’t result in meaningful change if we just do it once. We need to be continually reflective and aware of the digital habits that we’re developing. If we can get better at figuring out why we feel the need to play one more game rather than go to bed, we can often reveal deeper, offline issues at work. The first step in that process is catching yourself in the moment, and regardless of whether those habits that we identify are ultimately good or bad, creating an environment in which we can pick up and assess those habits.\nTweak the Habits That Aren’t Working\nOnce we’ve spotted unwanted habits, we need to modify our behavior to prevent them from turning into more serious problems. Unfortunately there’s no foolproof evidence base to use here, but we can try to figure out what works for each of us. Part of this involves becoming better at how the technologies we use actually work, including what’s already built into them to help, but it can also be useful to try nudges that might help us in that exercise in reflection. For example, research suggests that Night Shift modes on smartphones don’t actually do anything biologically to support sleep—but setting a time to have an overt shift in the color tone on your screen can be a simple reminder that you might want to start going to sleep soon.\nBe Critical of Your Own Tech Use, and What You’re Being Told About It\nResearch tells us that if we’re repeatedly exposed to an idea, even if we initially don’t believe it, over time we can start to accept it—what’s known as the illusory truth effect. So it’s important to remember that the broader narrative about screens has the potential to influence and color our own beliefs and frames of thinking about their effects in an unproductive way. If we want to be more constructive in changing our technology habits for the better, this means that we need to be more critical and reflective not just about the habits themselves, but what we’re told about their effects. The goal here isn’t to be instantly dismissive of any headlines you read about screens; rather, we need to approach them with a sense of cautious curiosity and evidence-based reasoning. And it’s worth bearing in mind that while some commentators frequently assert that the (negative) effects of smartphones and social media are clear, in reality, the science of screen time has no consensus agreement yet on the effects, positive or negative.\nIt’s OK to Talk About Your Tech Use\nWe need to put in a lot more effort when it comes to curating our digital lives. We need to remind ourselves that it’s OK to talk about what we do on our screens. In part because of the narratives that play out in the media, and in part because of the way that we’ve learned to use them, very often we feel a sense of guilt about being on our devices. In turn, it means that we tend to keep what we’re doing to ourselves. But studies have shown that when it comes to experiencing difficulties online, having resilient support networks around us is key to weathering those difficulties. Building those sorts of support networks starts with having more open, honest and nonjudgmental conversations with each other about the experiences that we have on our screens. By sharing what’s working for us, as well as where we don’t feel that we’re doing so well, we start to create a culture where it’s easier to ask for help, share advice, and ultimately learn from each other’s digital experiences. If we can do this, we can start to model better tech habits to those around us, and everyone wins.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nOften written about and reviewed on WIRED, OnePlus is a favorite device maker among Android enthusiasts who want the kind of clean design you get with an iPhone. Carrying several types of phones, tablets, keyboards, and other tech gear, OnePlus uses an Android-based operating system, is universally unblocked and works with all US carriers. We know how important your tech purchases are (duh, we’re WIRED) and we have a OnePlus promo code to help you save.\nSave 20% With This OnePlus Promo Code\nBecause we’re such fans here at WIRED, we have a code for 20% off in-app purchases on some of the most essential tech accessories, like cases, protections, chargers, and audio accessories. Just use the OnePlus coupon OPAPP20 at checkout to save big.\nTop Products From OnePlus\nAs mentioned, we at WIRED love OnePlus because of the affordable price point while maintaining solid quality. The newest iteration of the OnePlus 12 impressed us. One of the biggest drawbacks in previous models was the camera quality, but OnePlus has done a lot of work to improve it in the past few years and it’s now on level with competitors like Samsung. Our senior reviews editor and tech overlord Julian Chokkattu called the newest iteration a “Very Good Phone” (high praise from him). It also charges with blazing speed.\nWe also made a bold statement about the OnePlus Pad, whose existence we (perhaps polarizing) said “proves that Android tablets don’t have to suck”—and still think it’s a worthy iPad alternative, especially at a fair price point in the $400 range. Plus, we love their fun folding phone, the OnePlus Open, and recommend the OnePlus Keyboard 81 Pro if you’re a huge computer nerd.\nMore Ways to Save at OnePlus\nOnePlus incentivizes and rewards its customers by offering Red Cable Club, where OnePlus tech users can link their devices and redeem prizes, unlock exclusive savings, and get early deals. OnePlus often also offers bundle deals, like getting 30% off a OnePlus Watch 2R and 50% off Nord Buds 3 Pro when you make a OnePlus Open purchase.\nYou can also earn credits with the OnePlus Trade-in Program and get up to $528 off, and when you Invite Friends, you can get free OnePlus Buds 3. They have a myriad of other discounts, like the Student Discount, where all you have to do is verify your identity and get up to 10% off. OnePlus also offers up to 10% off for their Graduates Discount Program, where folks can unlock savings by verifying their ID with a Grad Beans account, and the Employee Discount Program, which also scores you 10% off.\nBe sure to check back regularly for a OnePlus promo code, like the OPAPP20 code for 20% off, and other discounts. OnePlus also regularly runs sales, like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which usually start a few days before the holiday and extend through Cyber Monday; the OnePlus Anniversary sale, which is typically in April, Prime Day, and holiday and seasonal sales, like the Back to School sale, Labor Day Sale, and Christmas and New Years sales.",

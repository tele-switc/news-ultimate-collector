Learn more.\nLast month, a surreptitious early glimpse of TAG Heuer’s full-scale revival—officially revealed today—of its iconic plastic-cased 1980s watch, the “Formula 1,” appeared in the fitting setting of the Grand Prix racetrack.\nFor the 2025 F1 season, the watchmaker, appointed the sport’s official timekeeper under a mega-sponsorship deal inked by its parent company, luxury conglomerate LVMH, has installed an eye-catching clock tower above the pit lane. The clock’s dive-style dial, “Mercedes” hour hand, and notched, bright-red bezel were instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with the original multicolored Formula 1 watch—which launched in 1986 and sold in its millions—or with the limited remake that briefly appeared last year, as a collaboration with the US streetwear label Kith.\nEagle-eyed TAG Heuer super-buffs (of which there are plenty) will also have spotted details that suggested something new: bolder dial proportions, squarer numerals on the bezel, and the modern TAG Heuer logo.\nSure enough, this is the format for the new take on the old favorite, announced today as a full, entry-level addition to the watch brand’s product line-up—albeit, at 38 mm, somewhat bigger than the original (the old model was 35 mm). Subtle design enhancements are deployed to give it a more contemporary feel: applied luminous hour markers, crisper hands, and a sleeker, more angular interpretation of the old case-shape, with its “hooded” lug protuberances originally designed to reinforce the plastic casing around the strap attachment.\nA nod toward eco credentials comes in the form of bioplastic—a castor-based polyamide which the brand has named TH-Polylight—an on-trend substitute for the “Arnite” thermoplastic of old. As before, though, this is molded over a steel inner core, making for a watch that's rather more robust than most plastic-cased equivalents.\nThere are nine variants: three in sandblasted stainless steel with green, black, or blue polymer bezels and six full-color limited-editions to become available at upcoming Grand Prix races, with cases and bezels in contrasting tones, including yellow/black, red/black, and green/red, all with matching rubber straps.\nWhat the TAG spotters won’t have gleaned from the pit lane clock, however, is that the updated Formula 1, officially titled the TAG Heuer Formula 1 Solargraph, is also the latest step in TAG Heuer’s plan to elevate the prestige of solar power by making it the backbone of its entry-level offering.\nAs with certain models in TAG’s Aquaracer sports-watch category, the new piece contains the brand’s solar-powered TH-50 movement using tech from Citizen, the Japanese company, attached to a movement supplied by the latter’s Swiss subsidiary, La Joux-Perret. At $1,800 (£1,650), the Formula 1 Solargraph is more than $1,000 cheaper than the basic Aquaracer Solargraph, and now by some distance the most affordable watch in TAG Heuer’s lineup. Nevertheless, within the broader category of solar-powered watches it carries a significant Swiss Made premium (for equivalent functionality, Citizen’s own watches top out at around $600).\nThe dial, consisting of two superposed polymer layers, allows light through to a solar cell beneath it, charging an accumulator storage unit that delivers energy to the movement. If left in darkness (in a drawer, for instance), a fully charged watch will continue to run for 10 months, an improvement on the six months originally claimed for the TH-50 movement (and also for Citizen’s own Eco Drive models). It can also be left in power-saving mode, with the crown pulled out to prevent the hands moving, for up to two and a half years, and takes just 10 seconds of light exposure to restart.\nOn the one hand, it’s notable that TAG Heuer—with its eyes firmly on the spending power of millions of Gen-Z consumers drawn to Formula 1’s mushrooming presence as a digital-first, Netflix-assisted pop-cultural phenomenon—continues to see electronic timekeeping as the gateway to its luxury watches. Like many brands, it has long used Swiss-made battery-powered movements for entry-level watches, but here the brand is attempting to position solar power as a modern, premium format, and a guarantee of the convenience and performance it says young buyers, in particular, are after.\n“From a client’s perspective, it’s a major benefit, because a standard quartz watch battery lasts two to three years, while the accumulator has a lifespan of over 15 years, and you don’t have to worry about the servicing needed for a mechanical watch,” says the brand’s movement director, Carole Forestier-Kasapi. “It’s accurate to within a couple of seconds a month, which is exceptional.”\nAn industry veteran charged with uplifting the technical side of TAG Heuer’s offering across its portfolio, Forestier-Kasapi says that extending the use of solar power is one of the key elements of that brief. A lack of Swiss uptake of solar tech (in luxury watches, Cartier produces a £3,300 solar-powered model, but there are few other examples) is attributable to the lack of Swiss-based suppliers with the capabilities to produce it, and a consequent suspicion of the technology’s value and worth.\nThis latter point, claims Forestier-Kasapi, is plainly wrong. And for the Swiss Made element, Citizen’s acquisition of La Joux-Perret—a specialist in haute horlogerie movement making—over a decade ago has delivered something of a convenient workaround. According to TAG Heuer, a “knowledge transfer” of IP, including patent rights, to La Joux-Perret from its Japanese owner has enabled it to develop the TH-50 movement exclusively for TAG Heuer, incorporating Citizen’s tech. “The fundamental technology is the same, but it’s a completely distinct development process,” says Forestier-Kasapi.\nThe key solar module and circuitry are nevertheless shipped from Japan, but with the timekeeping elements designed and made within La Joux-Perret. That means the movement meets the bar for “Swiss Made,” which by law requires development and assembly of a movement, along with 51 percent of the value of its components, to be in Switzerland. For the finished watch, assembly, and final inspection, along with the Swiss Made movement and at least 60 percent of the manufacturing costs, are needed.\nThe somewhat porous nature of these requirements—which allows myriad brands to creep in under the wire with multiple components, cases, dials, and bracelets sourced from far afield, including the Formula 1 Solargraph’s bioplastic elements, which are made in Asia—is a topic of regular (and increasing) debate within the Swiss industry. But it’s also something, TAG Heuer can reasonably assume, that’s of rather less importance to the audiences it’s targeting with what is, by any degree, a peppy and vibrant wristwatch, and one delivering a high-grade update on a quirky and distinctive legacy.\nNot least, TAG Heuer’s return to Formula One—both the watch and the sport—is being seen internally by its managers as a watershed moment in its mission to recapture momentum (and market share) lost in the decade prior to the pandemic. For the brand’s long-term fans, it's something of a homecoming.\nThe racetrack has for decades been TAG Heuer’s natural milieu. Its specialist timing equipment was used by teams from the early days of the sport, and from the 1960s onward its chronograph watches became staples in the world of motorsport. In 1971 it became the first watchmaker to feature its logo on a Formula One car when it entered into a commercial partnership with Ferrari. It later became a long-term sponsor of McLaren, and it currently has a tie-up with Oracle Red Bull Racing.\nIt was also Heuer’s association with the sport that resulted in the addition of the “TAG” acronym, which first appeared on the original Formula 1. In 1985, Heuer, then floundering under the stewardship of Piaget (today owned by Richemont Group), was majority-acquired by the company behind the McLaren racing team, Techniques d’Avant Garde (TAG), whose owners saw clear opportunities for synergistic leverage. Heuer, which by then had largely abandoned its former specialism in automotive chronographs for diving watches, had a fresh, cut-price play on the diving design ready to go, with a breezy style and multicolored thermoplastic case inspired, supposedly, by the world of Californian surf culture. All it lacked was a name.\nA swift revision saw the watch packaged as the debut product—and a commercial flag in the ground—of the new TAG Heuer, with the combined logo added to the dial and strap and given the name of the sport that ran through both sides of the deal. Made until 1995, it sold by the bucketload and was worn by McLaren’s world-beating class of drivers including Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, and Michael Schumacher.\nIt’s not hard to see that the Formula 1 was conceived, at least in part, as a response to the huge popularity of the plastic Swatch (launched in 1983), though with 200-meter water resistance and its plastic case molded around a steel core, the Formula 1 was certainly a more premium product. And despite its conceptual origins, its vibrant quirkiness ended up capturing something of the colorful energy of the motorsport in that era.\n“It embodied the sense of the 1980s and Formula 1 at that time—a real freedom, a strong character, and an expressive identity,” says TAG Heuer’s design lead, Julien Delcambre, responsible for upgrading its features for the Solargraph version. “Those are things that resonate now as well, and there’s obviously excitement for 1980s style too, and that’s what makes it so cool. It can speak to younger buyers who are discovering it for the first time but also older collectors who remember the original Formula 1. There’s a real emotional connection.”\nIf the Formula 1’s origins were heavily influenced by the success of the Swatch, then its revival with Kith last year could be interpreted as something of a concession to the hype around the MoonSwatch, Swatch’s Omega tie-up launched in 2022, which unquestionably galvanized interest in TAG Heuer’s own plastic watch.\nAs a like-for-like remake targeted at niche collectors (whether of hype products or of vintage watches), Kith’s edition even saw the brand engage the Swiss supplier of the original cases, which still had the necessary molds in its archives. But as a serious representation of TAG Heuer today, it was little more than a passing fancy. Delcambre says it didn’t even have his involvement, since as a like-for-like remake, there wasn’t any design involved.\nThe Formula 1 Solargraph, by contrast, is targeted firmly at the widest possible contemporary audience, as TAG Heuer looks to cash in on the power of F1 in the age of Liberty Media, the conglomerate whose ownership has taken the once-moribund motorsport to new heights and new generations of fans.\nWith the watch’s new sizing, crisp detailing, and robust straps and bracelets, it has an ergonomic solidity of a quite different order to its flimsy forebear, not least in the satisfying “click” of its most tactile element, the bidirectional rotating bezel—a distinct improvement on the puny, plasticky, unidirectional rotation of both the 1980s original and last year’s re-creation. Back in the testing labs, it’s put through further robotically controlled punishment—torsion testing on its straps and bracelet, pressure and shock testing, and a robot that simulates a decade of usage—that would surely destroy the original models in short order.\nTAG Heuer has also overhauled the wider, nonplastic Formula 1 line that grew out of the Arnite-cased original and which has represented its broad base offering for many years with a variety of automotive-inspired designs. The collection has been streamlined and heavily upgraded, in keeping with modernizations to the brand’s other core collections in the past few years.\nBut for a lot of old—and new—fans, it’ll be the limited-edition plastic, solar-powered option that really counts. So, no time to debate the wisdom of TAG’s strange decision to restrict the numbers of the brighter, more desirable versions of the new, bigger Formula 1, if you’re in the market for an upgraded slice of iconic ’80s watch design, the race is on.",

    "content_text": "Top career officials at the Department of the Interior (DOI) were placed on administrative leave late last week after declining to immediately give affiliates of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) levels of access to a payroll system that would in theory allow them to, among other things, stop individual Supreme Court justices’ paychecks.\nThe New York Times has reported that these officials include the DOI’s chief information and information security officers; sources tell WIRED they also include a top lawyer.\nFor several weeks, say sources with direct knowledge of the situation, DOGE operatives have been seeking what they termed “full” or “system” access to the DOI’s payroll, human resources, and credentialing systems. Among the systems to which it demanded full access is the Federal Personnel and Payroll System (FPPS), which is housed in the DOI’s Interior Business Center and is used by dozens of federal agencies ranging from the Department of Justice to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to handle payroll and records associated with more than 275,000 federal workers, including at agencies outside the executive branch.\nThe DOGE associates in question are Tyler Hassen, an energy executive and acting assistant secretary of policy, management, and budget at DOI; Stephanie Holmes, who runs HR for DOGE and is the acting chief human capital officer at DOI; and Katrine Trampe, an adviser to Doug Burgum, the secretary of the interior.\nAccording to sources with direct knowledge, when asked why they sought full access to these systems, the DOGE operatives said they specifically sought levels of permissions that would give them the ability to create, pause, and delete email accounts. This functionality doesn’t, strictly speaking, exist for any one user within the systems they were seeking to access, because such actions are, as a security measure, designed to be initiated by one person and approved by another. Granting their request would thus require them each to be given an essentially God-mode level of access to the entire system architecture.\nAccording to sources and a risk assessment memorandum reviewed by WIRED and first reported on by the Times, top career officials saw several issues with granting these unprecedented levels of access.\nFirst, it raised an inherent security issue. No single person at DOI has root-level permissions to all the systems the DOGE operatives sought to access, which could allow them—or an outside actor who had compromised their credentials—to do anything from overwrite the code base to look at the W2s and other personal information of, or even stop payments to, individual federal workers. (According to one source, who cited The Atlantic’s recent reporting on top national security officials sharing sensitive military information in a Signal chat, a specific concern raised within the Department of the Interior was that DOGE affiliates might share the credentials in an insecure way, leading to a breach on par with the hack of the Office of Personnel Management a decade ago, in which tens of millions of federal personnel records were accessed by hackers linked to the Chinese government.)\nSecond, it wasn’t clear that the DOGE affiliates had the authority to either access these systems or do what they purportedly wanted to. An executive order signed by President Donald Trump gives the US DOGE Service broad authority to access unclassified systems. But while Holmes is detailed to DOI from the US Digital Service, Hassen and Trampe are DOI employees and are not, according to one source with knowledge, even part of a formal DOGE team. That means they have no authority or privileges past those of a normal DOI employee. Even Holmes, the acting chief HR officer, does not obviously have the authority to cut off the email accounts of DOI employees outside her own office, let alone workers situated at other agencies or even outside the executive branch.\nTo determine whether it was possible to grant the requested access, the officials concluded, it would be necessary to review federal privacy and information security law as well as lines of authority within DOI.\nAccording to sources with knowledge, these issues were raised at a Thursday morning meeting between top technical and legal staff from the DOI and DOGE, where the career officials asked what specifically the DOGE affiliates were trying to do so as to evaluate whether there were legal means of granting them the necessary access. When pressed for information that would allow officials to evaluate DOGE’s request and the risks it would raise, Trampe, the sources say, simply reiterated that they sought system-level access that would allow them to create, pause, or delete email accounts, citing the authority of the executive order and saying the matter was not up for debate. It was made clear during the meeting, the sources say, that the deadline for granting the access was Friday.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at timmarchman.01.\nFollowing the meeting, top technical and legal officials drafted a risk assessment. (“Full administrative/root access enables individuals to initiate and modify personnel and payroll actions, potentially locking out other authorized users. Additionally, personnel with elevated privileges across multiple systems become prime targets for credential compromise by nation-state adversaries or other malicious actors,” they wrote.) Ultimately, they concluded that because of the inherent risks, only Burgum had the authority to grant the access DOGE requested.\nLate Friday afternoon, the chief information and information security officers and the associate solicitor at the Department of the Interior were, according to sources with knowledge, placed on leave and told they were being investigated for workplace behavior. It is believed within the department that on Saturday, DOGE was granted access to the FPPS, though sources were unclear on the level of the privileges they’d been given.\n“We are working to execute the president’s directive to cut costs and make the government more efficient for the American people and have taken actions to implement President Trump’s executive orders,” says a DOI spokesperson who did not give their name.\n“These people,” says one source at DOI who worries that DOGE affiliates could inadvertently destroy parts of the nearly 30-year-old FPPS, stop paychecks, or allow for a breach of the entire system, “have no idea what they’re doing.”",

Now Democrats in the US Senate are calling to amend the half-century-old law, citing ongoing attempts by billionaire Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to effectively commit the same offense—collusively collect untold quantities of personal data, drawing upon dozens if not hundreds of government systems.\nOn Monday, Democratic senators Ron Wyden, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen introduced the Privacy Act Modernization Act of 2025—a direct response, the lawmakers say, to the seizure by DOGE of computer systems containing vast tranches of sensitive personal information—moves that have notably coincided with the firings of hundreds of government officials charged with overseeing that data’s protection. “The seizure of millions of Americans’ sensitive information by Trump, Musk and other MAGA goons is plainly illegal,” Wyden tells WIRED, “but current remedies are too slow and need more teeth.”\nThe passage of the Privacy Act came in the wake of the McCarthy era—one of the darkest periods in American history, marked by unceasing ideological warfare and a government run amok, obsessed with constructing vast record systems to house files on hundreds of thousands of individuals and organizations. Secret dossiers on private citizens were the primary tool for suppressing free speech, assembly, and opinion, fueling decades’ worth of sedition prosecutions, loyalty oaths, and deportation proceedings. Countless writers, artists, teachers, and attorneys saw their livelihoods destroyed, while civil servants were routinely rounded up and purged as part of the roving inquisitions.\nThe first privacy law aimed at truly reining in the power of the administrative state, the Privacy Act was passed during the dawn of the microprocessor revolution, amid an emergence of high-speed telecommunications networks and “automated personal data systems.” The explosion in advancements coincided with Cassandra-like fears among ordinary Americans about a rise in unchecked government surveillance through the use of “universal identifiers.”\nA wave of such controversies, including Watergate and COINTELPRO, had all but annihilated public trust in the government’s handling of personal data. “The Privacy Act was part of our country’s response to the FBI abusing its access to revealing sensitive records on the American people,” says Wyden. “Our bill defends against new threats to Americans’ privacy and the integrity of federal systems, and ensures individuals can go after the government when officials break the law, including quickly stopping their illegal actions with a court order.”\nThe bill, first obtained by WIRED last week, would implement several textual changes aimed at strengthening the law—redefining, for instance, common terms such as “record” and “process” to more aptly comport with their usage in the 21st century. It further takes aim at certain exemptions and provisions under the Privacy Act that have faced decades’ worth of criticism by leading privacy and civil liberties experts.\nWhile the Privacy Act generally forbids the disclosure of Americans’ private records except to the “individual to whom the records pertain,” there are currently at least 10 exceptions that apply to this rule. Private records may be disclosed, for example, without consent in the interest of national defense, to determine an individual’s suitability for federal employment, or to “prevent, control, or reduce crime.” But one exception has remained controversial from the very start. Known as “routine use,” it enables government agencies to disclose private records so long as the reason for doing so is “compatible” with the purpose behind their collection.\nThe arbitrary ways in which the government applies the “routine use” exemption have been drawing criticism since at least 1977, when a blue-ribbon commission established by Congress reported that federal law enforcement agencies were creating “broad-worded routine uses,” while other agencies were engaged in “quid pro quo” arrangements—crafting their own novel “routine uses,” as long as other agencies joined in doing the same.\nNearly a decade later, Congress’ own group of assessors would find that “routine use” had become a “catch-all exemption” to the law.\nIn an effort to stem the overuse of this exemption, the bill introduced by the Democratic senators includes a new stipulation that, combined with enhanced minimization requirements, would require any “routine use” of private data to be both “appropriate” and “reasonably necessary,” providing a hook for potential plaintiffs in lawsuits against government offenders down the road. Meanwhile, agencies would be required to make publicly known “any purpose” for which a Privacy Act record might actually be employed.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at dell.3030.\nCody Venzke, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, notes that the bill would also hand Americans the right to sue states and municipalities, while expanding the right of action to include violations that could reasonably lead to harms. “Watching the courts and how they’ve handled the whole variety of suits filed under the Privacy Act, it's been frustrating to see them not take the data harms seriously or recognize the potential eventual harms that could come to be,” he says. Another major change, he adds, is that the bill expands who's actually covered under the Privacy Act from merely citizens and legal residents to virtually anyone physically inside the United States—aligning the law more firmly with current federal statutes limiting the reach of the government's most powerful surveillance tools.\nIn another key provision, the bill further seeks to rein in the government’s use of so-called “computer matching,” a process whereby a person’s private records are cross-referenced across two agencies, helping the government draw new inferences it couldn’t by examining each record alone. This was a loophole that Congress previously acknowledged in 1988, the first time it amended the Privacy Act, requiring agencies to enter into written agreements before engaging in matching, and to calculate how matching might impact an individual’s rights.\nThe changes imposed under the Democrats’ new bill would merely extend these protections to different record systems held by a single agency. To wit, the Internal Revenue Service has one system that contains records on “erroneous tax refunds,” while another holds data on the “seizure and sale of real property.” These changes would ensure that the restrictions on matching still apply, even though both systems are controlled by the IRS. What’s more, while the restrictions on matching do not currently extend to “statistical projects,” they would under the new text, if the project’s purpose might impact the individuals’ “rights, benefits, or privileges.” Or—in the case of federal employees—result in any “financial, personnel, or disciplinary action.”\nThe Privacy Act currently imposes rather meager criminal fines (no more than $5,000) against government employees who knowingly disclose Americans’ private records to anyone ineligible to receive them. The Democrats’ bill introduces a fine of up to $250,000, as well as the possibility of imprisonment, for anyone who leaks records “for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm.”\nThe bill has been endorsed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center and Public Citizen, two civil liberties nonprofits that are both engaged in active litigation against DOGE.\n“Over 50 years ago, Congress passed the Privacy Act to protect the public against the exploitation and misuse of their personal information held by the government,” Markey says in a statement. “Today, with Elon Musk and the DOGE team recklessly seeking to access Americans’ sensitive data, it’s time to bring this law into the digital age.”",

On Monday he said that the company has been thinking about releasing an open-weight model for some time, adding “now it feels important to do.”\nOpenAI may feel the need to show that it can train the new model cheaply, since DeepSeek’s model was purportedly trained at a fraction of the cost of most large AI models.\n“This is amazing news,” Clement Delangue, cofounder and CEO of HuggingFace, a company that specializes in hosting open AI models, told WIRED. “With DeepSeek, everyone’s realizing the power of open weights.”\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former employee who wants to talk about what's happening?

R1, Llama and other open-weight models can be downloaded for free and modified. A model’s weights refers to the values inside a large neural network—something that is set during training. Open-weight models are cheaper to use and can also be tailored for sensitive use cases, like handling highly confidential information.\nSteven Heidel, a member of the technical staff at OpenAI, reposted Altman’s announcement and added, “We're releasing a model this year that you can run on your own hardware.”\nJohannes Heidecke, a researcher working on AI safety at OpenAI, also reposted the message on X, adding that the company would conduct rigorous testing to ensure the open-weight model could not easily be misused. Some AI researchers worry that open-weight models could help criminals launch cyberattacks or even develop biological or chemical weapons. “While open models bring unique challenges, we’re guided by our Preparedness Framework and will not release models we believe pose catastrophic risks,” Heidecke wrote.\nOpenAI today also posted a webpage inviting developers to apply for early access to the forthcoming model. Altman said in his post that the company would host events for developers with early prototypes of the new model in the coming weeks.\nMeta was the first major AI company to pursue a more open approach, releasing the first version of Llama in July 2023. A growing number of open-weight AI models are now available. Some researchers note that Llama and some other models are not as transparent as they could be, because the training data and other details are still kept secret. Meta also imposes a license that limits other companies’ ability to profit from applications and tools built using Llama.\nUpdate March 31, 2025, 4:21 EST: This article was updated with a comment from Clement Delangue, cofounder and CEO of HuggingFace.",

    "content_text": "A prominent computer scientist who has spent 20 years publishing academic papers on cryptography, privacy, and cybersecurity has gone incommunicado, had his professor profile, email account, and phone number removed by his employer, Indiana University, and had his homes raided by the FBI. No one knows why.\nXiaofeng Wang has a long list of prestigious titles. He was the associate dean for research at Indiana University's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, a fellow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a tenured professor at Indiana University at Bloomington. According to his employer, he has served as principal investigator on research projects totaling nearly $23 million over his 21 years there.\nHe has also coauthored scores of academic papers on a diverse range of research fields, including cryptography, systems security, and data privacy, including the protection of human genomic data. I have personally spoken to him on three occasions for articles here, here, and here.\n“None of This Is in Any Way Normal”\nIn recent weeks, Wang's email account, phone number, and profile page at the Luddy School were quietly erased by his employer. Over the same time, Indiana University also removed a profile for his wife, Nianli Ma, who was listed as a lead systems analyst and programmer at the university's Library Technologies division.\nAs reported by The Bloomingtonian and later the The Herald-Times in Bloomington, a small fleet of unmarked cars driven by government agents descended on the Bloomington home of Wang and Ma on Friday. They spent most of the day going in and out of the house and occasionally transferred boxes from their vehicles. TV station WTHR, meanwhile, reported that a second home owned by Wang and Ma, located in Carmel, Indiana, was also searched. The station said that both a resident and an attorney for the resident were on scene during at least part of the search.\nAttempts to locate Wang and Ma have so far been unsuccessful. An Indiana University spokesman didn't answer emailed questions asking if the couple was still employed by the university and why their profile pages, email addresses, and phone numbers had been removed. The spokesman provided the contact information for a spokeswoman at the FBI's field office in Indianapolis. In an email, the spokeswoman wrote: “The FBI conducted court authorized law enforcement activity at homes in Bloomington and Carmel Friday. We have no further comment at this time.”\nSearches of federal court dockets turned up no documents related to Wang, Ma, or any searches of their residences. The FBI spokeswoman didn't answer questions seeking which US district court issued the warrant and when, and whether either Wang or Ma is being detained by authorities. Justice Department representatives didn't return an email seeking the same information. An email sent to a personal email address belonging to Wang went unanswered at the time this post went live. Their resident status (e.g., US citizens or green card holders) is currently unknown.\nFellow researchers took to social media over the weekend to register their concern over the series of events.\n“None of this is in any way normal,” Matthew Green, a professor specializing in cryptography at Johns Hopkins University, wrote on Mastodon. He continued: “Has anyone been in contact? I hear he’s been missing for two weeks and his students can’t reach him. How does this not get noticed for two weeks???”\nIn the same thread, Matt Blaze, a McDevitt professor of computer science and law at Georgetown University, said, “It's hard to imagine what reason there could be for the university to scrub its website as if he never worked there. And while there's a process for removing tenured faculty, it takes more than an afternoon to do it.”\nLocal news outlets reported the agents spent several hours moving boxes in an out of the residences. WTHR provided the following details about the raid on the Carmel home:\nNeighbors say the agents announced \"FBI, come out!\" over a megaphone.\nA woman came out of the house holding a phone. A video from a neighbor shows an agent taking that phone from her. She was then questioned in the driveway before agents began searching the home, collecting evidence and taking photos.\nA car was pulled out of the garage slightly to allow investigators to access the attic.\nThe woman left the house before 13News arrived. She returned just after noon accompanied by a lawyer. The group of 10 or so investigators left a few minutes later.\nThe FBI would not say what they were looking for or who is under investigation. A bureau spokesperson issued a statement: “I can confirm we conducted court-authorized activity at the address in Carmel today. We have no further comment at this time.”\nInvestigators were at the house for about four hours before leaving with several boxes of evidence. 13News rang the doorbell when the agents were gone. A lawyer representing the family who answered the door told us they're not sure yet what the investigation is about.\nThis post will be updated if new details become available. Anyone with firsthand knowledge of events involving Wang, Ma, or the investigation into either is encouraged to contact me, preferably over Signal at DanArs.82.

    "content_text": "Organizers behind a pronatalist conference with far-right ties in Austin, Texas, this weekend have set up matchmaking events for attendees that include the option of getting married onsite as part of their greater effort to repopulate the world, WIRED has learned.\nAccording to its website, the sold-out Natal Conference, taking place March 28-29 at a hotel operated by the University of Texas at Austin, has “no political or ideological goal other than a world in which our children can have grandchildren.” But the event, an earlier version of which was promoted by Elon Musk, features speakers like Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and Crémieux, an online pseudonym linked, according to The Guardian, to Jordan Lasker, who discusses falling birthrates and promotes eugenics.\nNatal Conference organizer Kevin Dolan, a father of at least six, according to Politico, has previously stated that eugenics—the belief that white people are genetically superior—and the pronatalist movement are “very much aligned.”\nPublicly available details about the Natal Conference are scant, with the vague online conference agenda promising closed-door sessions to address collapsing birth rates.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Do you have tips about the pronatalist movement or other internet culture stories? We'd like to hear from you. Contact senior culture editor Manisha Krishnan securely on Signal at mkrishnan.79 or email manisha_krishnan@wired.com.\nHowever, an email obtained by WIRED promoting a preconference mixer held Thursday night reveals matchmaking may play a significant role at the conference and in the pronatalist movement more widely.\n“This is a special email to NatalCon attendees who indicated they were highly interested in finding the missing puzzle piece for singles, matchmaking, marriage, and family formation,” reads the email, sent by an event producer named Luke, who did not sign with his last name.\n“We were stunned to receive many emails saying, ‘NatalCon needs to be focusing on this, right now!’ And we're here to serve you. This is coming from all sectors: singles, parents with dating-age children, grandparents, newlyweds that want to help their friends start families, and more,” the email said.\nAttendees are instructed to register to learn the exact venue (though it is listed elsewhere on the website), and registration was listed as costing $10,000 for the full weekend—an increase from earlier this year when the cost was 90 percent cheaper. (A Saturday-only ticket is $500.) Last year’s VIP package was $1,000, according to the NatalCon website. After credit card details are handed over, organizers vet potential attendees, requiring them to submit their social media handles. The website says prospective attendees aren’t charged unless they’re approved.\nNatalCon organizers, including Dolan, did not respond to messages from WIRED seeking comment.\nSingle registrants are directed to fill out a survey that asks their desired number of children (listing 1 to over 7 as options), “religious, spiritual, cultural, lifestyle” values, and whether they would be open to a “Q&A with a NatalCon speaker to introduce yourself to the room.”\nSpeaking to Edward Dutton—who has been described as a “proponent of pseudo-scientific ‘race science,’” by anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate—on a Jolly Heretic podcast in 2023, Dolan described his alma mater, Brigham Young University, as a “breeding program” for smart Mormons. He said his pronatalist events are a counter to the “perverse incentives in the dating app market.”\nIn the email to NatalCon attendees, Luke noted the conference had set up multiple sessions throughout the conference to strategize on the issue of matchmaking.\nThe email concludes by noting that there will be “some ministers attending if anyone decides to take the leap at the conference!” Luke also instructed attendees to “come up with great ideas” regarding matchmaking, which will be passed on to him “for implementation.”\nOther conference guests include Indian Bronson, the pseudonymous founder of AI dating app Keeper (he’s no longer affiliated with the company), which aims to help people start a family, and influencers Simone and Malcolm Collins, who have four kids and say they plan to have up to 13.\nThe pronatalist movement, which views declining birth rates around the world as an existential threat, has seen a boom in recent years, propelled by famous and powerful tech elites, including Musk, who has 14 children. Tweeting about the 2023 Natal Conference, Musk said, “If birth rates continue to plummet, human civilization will end.”\nEven tech elites who have not explicitly associated themselves with the movement seem generally aligned with its aims: Sam Altman, for instance, has invested in multiple fertility startups and said he would like to have a family with “six or eight” children.\nThe movement gained even more momentum during the 2024 election, when comments surfaced of then vice presidential candidate JD Vance calling Democrats \"childless cat ladies” around the time of his Senate run in 2021; he also previously said people with children “should have more power” than “people who don’t have kids.”\nHowever, the pronatalist movement has been criticized as being racist and classist, with some startups catering to adherents by even offering to screen embryos used for in vitro fertilization for IQ.\nDolan told the Jolly Heretic podcast his pronatalist events weed out “stupid people.”\n“Some of the debates that I hear about natalism [are] like, ‘We can’t have natalism, we have too many stupid people.’ But in my opinion the only people who are going to respond to any of our natalism conferences, natalism conversations, are going to be on the higher end of the distribution,” he said.\nDespite criticism of the conference, University of Texas at Austin spokesperson Mike Rosen told WIRED the school rents out its spaces indiscriminately. “The AT&T Hotel & Conference Center leases space to non-University groups for their events without regard to their viewpoint consistent with the First Amendment,\" Rosen said.\nThe venue also hosted an Ayn Rand conference in February.\nUpdated: 3/31/2025, 11:30 AM EDT: This article has been updated to reflect that while pseudonymous writer Indian Bronson was a co-founder of the Keeper dating app, he is no longer affiliated with the company.",

    "content_text": "Over the weekend, thousands of people joined the “Tesla Takedown” protest movement at the company’s showrooms across the country. At the same time, a much smaller number of Elon Musk supporters turned out at Tesla locations for a counterprotest movement that some participants dubbed “Tesla Shield.”\nWhile the protest movement comprises people angered at Elon Musk’s role in the dismantling of federal government agencies, the counterprotest movement that showed up this weekend was peopled mostly by MAGA supporters. Among them were an array of far-right extremists, including members of the Proud Boys, armed militias, and at one event in Idaho, a guy dressed as Hitler.\nAs Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) rips through huge swaths of the federal government and puts people’s lives and livelihoods at risk, the Tesla protest movement has gained traction. Tesla’s stock price has dropped by more than 30 percent since the beginning of the year. Isolated incidents of vandalism against Tesla vehicles and chargers as well as dealerships have led Trump to push the Department of Justice to treat alleged violent protesters as “domestic terrorists,” and now some extremist groups have taken it upon themselves to help Musk fight back.\n“My people will be free, my people will rule again,” David Pettinger, a member of the extremist anti-government People’s Rights group, shouted at protesters in a fake German accent outside a Tesla dealership in Meridian, Idaho, on Saturday, according to video footage of the incident.\nA moustachioed Pettinger wore a T-shirt with the words “LITERALLY HITLER” written on the back and a picture of Musk giving a nazi-like salute on the front. Wearing jodhpurs and black boots, Pettinger marched in front of protesters and handed out heart-shaped stickers to Musk supporters.\nPettinger told WIRED that he dressed as Hitler to “make fun of the overuse of the terms nazi and fascist.” However, Pettinger’s posts on X echo Hitler’s deeply antisemitic worldview.\nAlso in Meridian were a number of armed individuals in camouflage gear, some wearing body armor, according to images of the counterprotest posted to Bluesky. Pettinger also appeared to be armed, according to video footage showing a handgun tucked into his jodhpurs.\nMeanwhile, Josh Fulfer, who is known online as Oreo Express and was at the US Capitol in Washington on January 6, joined a counterprotest group in Fresno, California, telling a local news outlet: “We’re out here to show support for DOGE, Elon Musk, Tesla, and this administration.” Fulfer can be seen on his own videos harassing and shouting at protesters.\nAhead of the Tesla Takedown protests this weekend, the Proud Boys and other far-right groups put out calls on their social media channels for supporters to show up in numbers and counter the protests.\nA virtually all of the dealerships which had protests this weekend, however, the number of anti-Musk protesters vastly outnumbered the pro-Musk protesters.\nIn Columbus, Ohio, news that a local Proud Boy chapter had urged supporters to show up didn’t dissuade more than 1,000 anti-Musk protesters from turning up. Meanwhile, fewer than 50 pro-Musk supporters were in attendance, according to local media. The Proud Boy group claimed they would be infiltrating the protesters to gather information, but it’s unclear if they were present at Saturday’s protest.\nIn Salem, Oregon, pro-Musk supporters waved Proud Boys flags in front of a Tesla dealership while many of them walked around wearing the group’s uniform of yellow and black clothing.\nMeanwhile, in Oklahoma, the far-right anti-government militia group Veterans on Patrol announced on its Telegram channel that it was taking a break from monitoring and tracking immigrants to infiltrate a Tesla Takedown protest for “redirecting action against Elon and EVs towards a more reasonable target.”\nMusk himself posted multiple times about the protests over the weekend, claiming without any evidence that the protesters were being paid. The hate-filled LibsofTikTok account, operated by Chaya Raichik, responded to one of Musk’s post, claiming: “Soros is paying for this,” referring to Hungarian billionaire and philanthropist George Soros, who far-right figures believe is controlling huge swaths of the global population.\nAs Musk continues to tear through the federal government, and Tesla’s stock price continues to plummet, the organizers of the Tesla Takedown movement have pledged to continue to protest, with the movement now reaching other parts of the world as well. But equally, members identifying with the so-called Tesla Shield movement have vowed, on posts on X and Facebook, to continue their efforts to defend Musk and his company.",

Whether you're using a MacBook Air or a Mac Studio, these machines can power through a wide range of tasks. But installing the right apps can up the ante on the entire experience. If you're looking to fine-tune your workflow, stay organized, or add new features macOS is missing, third-party apps can be a game changer.\nBelow, you'll find what we think are the best Mac apps to help improve your software setup and expand your Mac's capabilities, from photo editing apps to writing apps. Many aren't free, but they typically come with free trials you can take advantage of. We've also thrown in some of our go-to native Mac apps, in case you haven't tried them yet.\nCheck out our many other guides, including the Best MacBooks, Best iPads, Best iPhones, and How to Back Up Your iPhone.\nUpdated March 2025: We've added native Apple apps like Stickies, iPhone Mirroring, and Apple TV, as well as Kindle and Amazon Prime Video.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nFor a Better User Experience\nI hate having to keep wiggling a finger on the trackpad for certain tasks to keep my laptop from going to sleep—I experience this a lot when I upload large files to Google Drive. This app keeps your Mac awake so you don’t have to do it manually. It works with external displays as well, and you can also use triggers to automate when it should sleep.\nEven though macOS comes with a bunch of useful keyboard shortcuts, it’s tough to memorize them all. Thankfully, with CheatSheet, you don’t have to. The app displays all your available keyboard shortcuts depending on the app you're using. You can pull it up when you need to find a specific one and hide it when you don’t need it anymore. It works with both first-party apps and third-party apps. It’s a great productivity tool for those who want to cut down time on having to either guess or look up specific shortcuts (like how to take a screenshot).\nAdGuard is a stand-alone macOS app that allows you to customize various filters to block pop-up ads, social media extensions, URL redirects, and more. It works with your browser but also other apps you’ve installed on your Mac. You can sign up for a two-week trial if you want to test it out first, but after that, you’ll have to pay for a license to use it. You can pick between a one-year or a lifetime subscription, both of which come with the choice between personal or family tiers.\nWhether you’re using Zoom for work calls or to connect with friends and family, the stand-alone app delivers a far more intuitive experience than using a browser. The free version allows for meetings up to 40 minutes long and comes with additional features like screen sharing, notes, messaging, the whiteboard feature (where you can collaborate with text and drawings via a shared board), and more. For additional features, you can opt for the Pro tier ($13 a month) or the Business tier (for $18 a month).\nApolloOne is a great option for professional photographers who need to manage all of their content. You can use it to sort and classify photos, batch-process catalogs of RAW image files, and edit or view metadata. If you sign up for the 14-day free trial, you’ll only have access to select features. To unlock additional perks, you can pick between the Standard Edition ($30 a year) or the Pro Edition ($50 a year).\nLightroom offers a ton of editing tools for both photos and videos. You can apply presets, alter the color contrast, tweak the color temperature, remove unwanted objects, and more. If you’re new to the app, it might take a while to get the hang of it. But the interface is easy to use, so it shouldn’t take too long to get past the learning curve. Adobe also offers a free seven-day trial if you want to try it out before buying it.\nIf you need an image viewer, Edgeview 3 is a solid choice that's been developed specifically for macOS. You can use it to open different image files like JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, and RAW files (including DSLR, EPS, and PDF), with the ability to browse through folders of images and catalog them more easily than with the native image viewer. It doesn't come with all the same features as the more advanced versions out there, so this is a better option for those looking for a lightweight app that's intuitive to use.\nThis is a sleek, modern video player that could pass as one of Apple's own. It can play a lot more types of file formats and codecs than the stock version, though (YouTube playlists and online streams included). VLC Media Player is also a great alternative. It's been around since 2001, but it's still supported and a reliable option.\nApple added a free app called iPhone Mirroring in macOS Sequoia (it should automatically appear when you update your Mac). It allows you to access and interact with your iPhone wirelessly via your Mac. When you open the app and connect your iPhone, you'll see your phone's home screen appear. You can then use your Mac to drag and drop content between both devices, swipe through the pages on your home screen, view and respond to notifications, and open and use any apps. Your iPhone will remain locked while using the feature too. It's been super useful when my phone is charging on my nightstand while I'm at my desk or if I leave it in another room.\nFor a Better Writing Experience\nUlysses' plain text and simple interface are perfect for writing longer stories, as well as novels, poetry, short stories, and scripts. You won't be distracted by all the unnecessary buttons, icons, and settings, which makes it easier to focus on your work. There's a free trial, but you can also opt for the $6 per month plan. If you decide to pay for it, you'll also get the iOS app in addition to the macOS version.\nIf you don't want to pay for writing tools like Microsoft Office, you're not a fan of Apple's office suite, or you would rather not rely on the cloud via Google’s G Suite, then LibreOffice is for you. It comes with all the necessary features like a spreadsheet editor and word processor, but it's also compatible with Microsoft file types or other formats like .doc. It's open source, too, and best of all, free.\nIt's spendy, but Microsoft 365 comes with a few features that LibreOffice doesn't. For starters, you'll have access to Word's Editor tool, which scans your work for grammatical mistakes and also makes suggestions (similar to Grammarly). There's a free in-app voice transcription feature too, which is just as accurate as the pricier, stand-alone software out there. There's a free one-month trial, so you have time to decide whether you want to purchase the full suite.\nI rely on Grammarly for everything—whether it's writing articles, reviews, or emails. You can use it as a stand-alone app or within your browser. It'll proofread your work in real time by checking your grammar and spelling, as well as analyzing your tone and writing style while offering suggestions on ways to improve it. There's a free version (what I use), but the paid version for $12 per month comes with additional capabilities like a plagiarism checker, formatting and citation suggestions, an AI-powered writing assistant, and more.\nApple has a Journal app, but it's only available on iPhone. Day One is a great alternative if you prefer to journal on your Mac. It's end-to-end encrypted, secured with a passcode or biometrics, and automatically backs up to save your work. You can also add photos, export entries in different formats (including PDFs), and save voice recordings. The free version is limited, so I suggest paying the $35 per year fee to access the full suite of features. There's a one-month free trial if you're on the fence.\nWe love the Notes app. As WIRED reviewer Adrienne So wrote in her in her rave: “If you want to know who someone truly is—what they eat, what books they read, what movies they watch, or how furious they get inside their own minds—you should probably check their Notes app.” And it's true. It's the perfect place to dump all your thoughts; whether it's putting together a checklist for an upcoming trip or journaling your thoughts (the Journal app isn't available on macOS), Notes is super versatile. In addition to your own words, you can also add attachments like photos, web links, and PDFs, alter the text styles, link different notes to each other, and more.\nFor Better Organization\nI am always screenshotting recipes I find online and then struggle to find them again once I'm ready to start cooking. With Paprika, you can save recipe web pages, organize them in folders, and check off ingredients as you cook. You can scale ingredients for different serving sizes as well. It's available as both an iOS and Android app (but you'll have to buy that one separately for $5) to sync the recipes across multiple platforms and devices.\nMy desktop often gets cluttered with random files, which makes it tough to find the ones I'm looking for. Hazel makes it a lot easier to feel organized. Simply tell it which folders to watch (like your Downloads folder) and it'll automatically move the file to the respective folder while also sorting it by name, type, date, what site it came from, and more. Whenever you create or download a new file, it'll be moved automatically. It's also a one-time purchase.\nTired of having a bunch of tabs open at once? Shift uses a one-window app to sign into a bunch of apps simultaneously. So, you can log into Slack, Instagram, Gmail, Spotify, Google Docks, Facebook Messenger, and more, all in one place. There's an Advanced tier for $149 per year, which gives you unlimited app accounts and unlimited Gmail, GSuite, Outlook, and Office 365 accounts. Meanwhile, the free tier only allows you to use a specific number of accounts in addition to the Chrome extension and some other basic features.\nDropbox is a great solution for anyone collaborating with non-Apple devices—whether it's Android or Windows. The free version comes with up to 2 GB of storage, which is plenty for basic content like documents. There's also the Plus tier for $10 a month, which comes with 2 TB of storage. You can transfer files up to 50 GB, and have 30 days to restore deleted files. If you want more storage, upgrading to the professional tier will cost you $17 per month. It comes with 3 TB of storage, transfers files up to 100 GB, gives you 180 days to restore deleted files, and more. It's important to note, however, that this app won't back up your files. So if you delete it on the desktop, it will also delete it from the cloud.\nWhen you think of Slack, you likely think of working in a corporate setting. Since we use it here at WIRED, I always have it downloaded on my Mac. But it's also a great chat platform to use if you're part of hobbyist groups or are looking for a more suitable alternative to WhatsApp and Telegram for certain group chats. You can customize the settings too, with the ability to set do-not-disturb times, mute channels completely, receive notifications when someone mentions you or sends you a direct message, and more.\nI am very picky about which apps I keep on my dock, but Apple's Reminders app is nonnegotiable. I'm always using it to set reminders for various tasks like picking up items at the grocery store, sending emails, setting up doctor appointments, and more. The app is super easy to use, especially if you're already familiar with the iOS version. You can create reminders for the day of an event as well as schedule or flag them. You can also organize each one by title, due date, and creation date. You have access to a ton of other features too, including the ability to save lists as templates (for future use), schedule reminders, collaborate with others, and more.\nApple's Freeform app is a great collaboration tool. The digital whiteboard app provides you with a blank canvas that you can use to draw sketches on, import files or web links, and add objects. It's handy if you're looking for a place to create design boards, itineraries for upcoming vacations, storyboards, and more. You can also share it with other Apple users who can then add their own content to the same board. Since it's stored on iCloud, any changes you make will also sync across all your other Apple devices in real time.\nI love Post-Its—I stick them to my monitor, my desk, the pages of books I'm reading, and more. So, it's only natural that I also use the Stickies app on my MacBook. I typically have multiple Stickies on my desktop at any given time— one for my list of assignments for the week, another for errands I have to run, and one for groceries. You can also customize each one (with different fonts and colors), adjust the size, and move them anywhere around your screen.\nFor More Security\nNordVPN holds the title of the fastest option in our Best VPNs guide. In addition to its fast speeds, it also has a wide variety of servers across the globe, and a setting where it will automatically connect when it senses you're on an untrusted Wi-Fi network. It also supports a wide variety of protocols, including OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec for mobile, and NordLynx. If you download the mobile version, you'll also have access to the built-in ad and tracking blocker, but it's also great for unblocking entertainment sites like Hulu, Netflix, and Max.\nBitwarden is a secure, open source password manager that’s also free. It’s our favorite password manager. The macOS and iOS applications are polished and user-friendly, and they’re open source, which means the code that powers Bitwarden is freely available for anyone to inspect, seek out flaws, and fix. In theory, the more eyes on the code, the more airtight it becomes. Bitwarden was also audited for 2023 by a third party to ensure it’s secure. Bitwarden supports passwordless authentication using passkeys, which means you don't need to use your username or password even to open your vault. We've linked to the free version, but Bitwarden offers a Premium version for $10 a year and a Families tier for $40 a year, both of which pack additional features listed here.\nWhile Bitwarden is our favorite for most people, Dashlane is our top pick if you're looking for the most feature-packed. If you opt for the free version, you'll have the ability to store up to 25 logins, access to the password generator and secure notes feature, the ability to copy/paste credentials, and autofill. But you can only use it on one device at a time. The Premium version, which costs $5 per month, offers unlimited password storage, email and chat support, as well as the ability to use it on multiple devices.\nMSP360 (formerly known as CloudBerry) is a free app that automates backups to cloud services like Amazon AWS S3 or Backblaze B2. You'll have to make the accounts separately and set them up manually, but once that's done, you're all set. Unless you're dealing with large files, like videos or raw-format photos, the free tier should be more than enough.\nFor a Better Entertainment Experience\nI typically carry my Kindle Paperwhite with me everywhere, but there are times when I forget to throw it in my bag or don't anticipate having any time to read. On the off chance I have downtime and only have my MacBook on me, I'll open up the Kindle app (it's less distracting than my phone). It syncs with your Amazon account, so you'll be able to pick up on the page you left off on your Kindle. As with the physical e-reader, you can customize the font, font size, layout, themes, and more. You'll also have access to the rest of your library, along with your notebook for anyone with a Kindle Scribe.\nI've been using Spotify for over a decade now and have never looked back. The music streaming app has a clean and user-friendly interface, strong discovery algorithms (for music, podcasts, and audiobooks), as well as great social components for sharing music with friends and family. I highly recommend the $12 per month for the Premium tier, which gives you ad-free listening, high-quality audio, the ability to download music to listen offline, and more.\nSometimes, I watch TV on my laptop, and a lot of those shows are on Apple TV (Shrinking, Severance, The Morning Show, etc). Whenever I want to catch up on episodes, I use the Apple TV app, which gives me access to Apple TV+ for $10 a month. But you can also use it to access any movies or TV shows you've purchased, with the ability to browse and buy more through the app. It's easy to navigate, too, with all of the shows you're currently watching neatly organized within the Home tab, so you can access each show quickly.\nYes, I watch a lot of TV, and this is another app I use often. You'll need a Prime Video subscription (if you're not already an Amazon Prime member), which costs $15 per month or $139 per year. It has the same interface as the TV or smartphone app, with the ability to see all the content you're currently watching, along with recommended movies and shows. You can also access the Prime Video store as well as your downloads for when you don't have Wi-Fi.",

It can play a lot more types of file formats and codecs than the stock version, though (YouTube playlists and online streams included). <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3ML3AxBWphqb6VwGpkzhvwpMawtSka882hZvF3TvBSp3dojTbpzrUARrUrYuKvHrSakXeKSs3N5Sqx4T9Hb8fBtJwGNhbhyGttKi8N3JVTKZriuayFHFFEjP7jjxU34rbm8QYScJv1KpfUe9TvTFNk193v5d8Zeemt6Q8hcVHqWz4ZMnWP3uFwq5E4dXoHkTiUwcqtoAQX6bqy6baCgaDKMrnn79yWCUCDkzZqY9Mykccqf2Lqh8djUB6BnSCBcQa9rXyqPqDFT5DptsACWc9BVfrBvSHZ52J4xpmw\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3ML3AxBWphqb6VwGpkzhvwpMawtSka882hZvF3TvBSp3dojTbpzrUARrUrYuKvHrSakXeKSs3N5Sqx4T9Hb8fBtJwGNhbhyGttKi8N3JVTKZriuayFHFFEjP7jjxU34rbm8QYScJv1KpfUe9TvTFNk193v5d8Zeemt6Q8hcVHqWz4ZMnWP3uFwq5E4dXoHkTiUwcqtoAQX6bqy6baCgaDKMrnn79yWCUCDkzZqY9Mykccqf2Lqh8djUB6BnSCBcQa9rXyqPqDFT5DptsACWc9BVfrBvSHZ52J4xpmw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VLC Media Player</a> is also a great alternative. It's been around since 2001, but it's still supported and a reliable option.</p><p aria-level=\"3\" class=\"paywall heading-h3\" role=\"heading\">Apple’s iPhone Mirroring (Free)</p><p class=\"paywall\">Apple added a free app called iPhone Mirroring in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-macos-sequoia-features/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">macOS Sequoia</a> (it should automatically appear when you update your Mac). It allows you to access and interact with your iPhone wirelessly via your Mac. When you open the app and connect your iPhone, you'll see your phone's home screen appear. You can then use your Mac to drag and drop content between both devices, swipe through the pages on your home screen, view and respond to notifications, and open and use any apps. Your iPhone will remain locked while using the feature too. It's been super useful when my phone is charging on my nightstand while I'm at my desk or if I leave it in another room.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">For a Better Writing Experience</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>Ulysses</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Courtesy of Ulysses </span></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Ulysses' plain text and simple interface are perfect for writing longer stories, as well as novels, poetry, short stories, and scripts. You won't be distracted by all the unnecessary buttons, icons, and settings, which makes it easier to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-apps-for-distraction-free-writing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">focus on your work</a>. There's a free trial, but you can also opt for the $6 per month plan. If you decide to pay for it, you'll also get the iOS app in addition to the macOS version.</p><p class=\"paywall\">If you don't want to pay for writing tools like Microsoft Office, you're not a fan of Apple's office suite, or you would rather not rely on the cloud via Google’s G Suite, then LibreOffice is for you. It comes with all the necessary features like a spreadsheet editor and word processor, but it's also compatible with Microsoft file types or other formats like .doc. It's open source, too, and best of all, free.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It's spendy, but Microsoft 365 comes with a few features that LibreOffice doesn't. For starters, you'll have access to Word's Editor tool, which scans your work for grammatical mistakes and also makes suggestions (similar to Grammarly). There's a free in-app voice transcription feature too, which is just as accurate as the pricier, stand-alone software out there. There's a free one-month trial, so you have time to decide whether you want to purchase the full suite.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I rely on Grammarly for everything—whether it's writing articles, reviews, or emails. You can use it as a stand-alone app or within your browser. It'll proofread your work in real time by checking your grammar and spelling, as well as analyzing your tone and writing style while offering suggestions on ways to improve it. There's a free version (what I use), but the paid version for $12 per month comes with additional capabilities like a plagiarism checker, formatting and citation suggestions, an AI-powered writing assistant, and more.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Apple has a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-journal-app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Journal app</a>, but it's only available on iPhone. Day One is a great alternative if you prefer to journal on your Mac. It's end-to-end encrypted, secured with a passcode or biometrics, and automatically backs up to save your work. You can also add photos, export entries in different formats (including PDFs), and save voice recordings. The free version is limited, so I suggest paying the $35 per year fee to access the full suite of features. There's a one-month free trial if you're on the fence.</p><p class=\"paywall\">We <em>love</em> the Notes app. As WIRED reviewer Adrienne So wrote in her <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/iphone-notes-app-purest-reflection-of-our-humanity/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in her rave</a>: “If you want to know who someone truly <em>is</em>—what they eat, what books they read, what movies they watch, or how furious they get inside their own minds—you should probably check their Notes app.” And it's true. It's the perfect place to dump all your thoughts; whether it's putting together a checklist for an upcoming trip or journaling your thoughts (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-journal-app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Journal app</a> isn't available on macOS), Notes is super versatile. In addition to your own words, you can also add attachments like photos, web links, and PDFs, alter the text styles, link different notes to each other, and more.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">For Better Organization</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>Paprika Recipe Manager</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Courtesy of Paprika App</span></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">I am always screenshotting recipes I find online and then struggle to find them again once I'm ready to start cooking. With Paprika, you can save recipe web pages, organize them in folders, and check off ingredients as you cook. You can scale ingredients for different serving sizes as well. It's available as both an iOS and Android app (but you'll have to buy that one separately for $5) to sync the recipes across multiple platforms and devices.</p><p class=\"paywall\">My desktop often gets cluttered with random files, which makes it tough to find the ones I'm looking for. Hazel makes it a lot easier to feel organized. Simply tell it which folders to watch (like your Downloads folder) and it'll automatically move the file to the respective folder while also sorting it by name, type, date, what site it came from, and more. Whenever you create or download a new file, it'll be moved automatically. It's also a one-time purchase.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Tired of having a bunch of tabs open at once? Shift uses a one-window app to sign into a bunch of apps simultaneously. So, you can log into Slack, Instagram, Gmail, Spotify, Google Docks, Facebook Messenger, and more, all in one place. There's an Advanced tier for $149 per year, which gives you unlimited app accounts and unlimited Gmail, GSuite, Outlook, and Office 365 accounts. Meanwhile, the free tier only allows you to use a specific number of accounts in addition to the Chrome extension and some other basic features.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Dropbox is a great solution for anyone collaborating with non-Apple devices—whether it's Android or Windows. The free version comes with up to 2 GB of storage, which is plenty for basic content like documents. There's also the Plus tier for $10 a month, which comes with 2 TB of storage. You can transfer files up to 50 GB, and have 30 days to restore deleted files. If you want more storage, upgrading to the professional tier will cost you $17 per month. It comes with 3 TB of storage, transfers files up to 100 GB, gives you 180 days to restore deleted files, and more. It's important to note, however, that this app won't back up your files. So if you delete it on the desktop, it will also delete it from the cloud.</p><p class=\"paywall\">When you think of Slack, you likely think of working in a corporate setting. Since we use it here at WIRED, I always have it downloaded on my Mac. But it's also a great chat platform to use if you're part of hobbyist groups or are looking for a more suitable alternative to WhatsApp and Telegram for certain group chats. You can customize the settings too, with the ability to set do-not-disturb times, mute channels completely, receive notifications when someone mentions you or sends you a direct message, and more.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I am very picky about which apps I keep on my dock, but Apple's Reminders app is nonnegotiable. I'm always using it to set reminders for various tasks like picking up items at the grocery store, sending emails, setting up doctor appointments, and more. The app is super easy to use, especially if you're already familiar with the iOS version. You can create reminders for the day of an event as well as schedule or flag them. You can also organize each one by title, due date, and creation date. You have access to a ton of other features too, including the ability to save lists as templates (for future use), schedule reminders, collaborate with others, and more.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Apple's <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-freeform-app/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Freeform app</a> is a great collaboration tool. The digital whiteboard app provides you with a blank canvas that you can use to draw sketches on, import files or web links, and add objects. It's handy if you're looking for a place to create design boards, itineraries for upcoming vacations, storyboards, and more. You can also share it with other Apple users who can then add their own content to the same board. Since it's stored on iCloud, any changes you make will also sync across all your other Apple devices in real time.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I love Post-Its—I stick them to my monitor, my desk, the pages of books I'm reading, and more. So, it's only natural that I also use the Stickies app on my MacBook. I typically have multiple Stickies on my desktop at any given time— one for my list of assignments for the week, another for errands I have to run, and one for groceries. You can also customize each one (with different fonts and colors), adjust the size, and move them anywhere around your screen.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">For More Security</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>NordVPN</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Courtesy of NordVPN</span></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">NordVPN holds the title of the fastest option in our <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-vpn/#:~:text=Updated%20January%202025%3A%20We've,section%20for%20VPNs%20on%20iOS.&amp;text=Special%20offer%20for%20Gear%20readers,%2C%20and%20subscriber-only%20newsletters.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best VPNs guide</a>. In addition to its fast speeds, it also has a wide variety of servers across the globe, and a setting where it will automatically connect when it senses you're on an untrusted Wi-Fi network. It also supports a wide variety of protocols, including OpenVPN, IKEv2/IPsec for mobile, and NordLynx. If you download the mobile version, you'll also have access to the built-in ad and tracking blocker, but it's also great for unblocking entertainment sites like Hulu, Netflix, and Max.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Bitwarden is a secure, open source password manager that’s also free. It’s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-password-managers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our favorite password manager</a>.

Bitwarden supports passwordless authentication using passkeys, which means you don't need to use your username or password even to open your vault. We've linked to the free version, but Bitwarden offers a Premium version for $10 a year and a Families tier for $40 a year, both of which pack additional features listed <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/iqZ9y5iK3WikqF64Z6iaV1PFzGdy6wr1EVtcQn3v6NTwsimYy53i7kLZN1PkUYXJhrnYveffgnjoV9msZsB1rxGJHZ53P8nsDM2u8aHvPsCUzXTgKCAGgr6qmrky3ZK1S2pc356kVb93syvUDDdAEqEWPpxjuVuEwfSDp2su9mHgLpTgAei8spM251uJzEbUCLtRrHYjhLsvPEGgPa1khi6aZkyuMZJ9MWy4Ej5ZoLoAsu7oP7TNQzTN7q6XjyoyEzJ7JSFibWSnN5G1mH6WrWo13\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://bitwarden.com/pricing/\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/iqZ9y5iK3WikqF64Z6iaV1PFzGdy6wr1EVtcQn3v6NTwsimYy53i7kLZN1PkUYXJhrnYveffgnjoV9msZsB1rxGJHZ53P8nsDM2u8aHvPsCUzXTgKCAGgr6qmrky3ZK1S2pc356kVb93syvUDDdAEqEWPpxjuVuEwfSDp2su9mHgLpTgAei8spM251uJzEbUCLtRrHYjhLsvPEGgPa1khi6aZkyuMZJ9MWy4Ej5ZoLoAsu7oP7TNQzTN7q6XjyoyEzJ7JSFibWSnN5G1mH6WrWo13\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">While Bitwarden is our favorite for most people, Dashlane is our top pick if you're looking for the most feature-packed. If you opt for the free version, you'll have the ability to store up to 25 logins, access to the password generator and secure notes feature, the ability to copy/paste credentials, and autofill. But you can only use it on one device at a time. The Premium version, which costs $5 per month, offers unlimited password storage, email and chat support, as well as the ability to use it on multiple devices.</p><p class=\"paywall\">MSP360 (formerly known as CloudBerry) is a free app that automates backups to cloud services like <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/7PpuYtEvLfvatp9mv5GRz6VPBzG477coTCxU9ZdQf8NKCxUwUDMbWBAkWzVqimjfGn49bKzm4Jo4oKRLdojo7xiRJs1fM5jhnn7jaTru7f3rjkjhKfShkgksoHQtfTSLfo8RjRGfSfNqM9C2h3dMBjHsVdtrRv1VdstfsN6aqVe7nSoXiD4iJAc5Za6gUzZv72Wdg52tcsn5qkCbDUGyShT4dfoVbKwi19HjkUZ94S5C7VjPc3Kxvv7hsGz7yretj7j97bD6SBs2LzJb7vGh\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/7PpuYtEvLfvatp9mv5GRz6VPBzG477coTCxU9ZdQf8NKCxUwUDMbWBAkWzVqimjfGn49bKzm4Jo4oKRLdojo7xiRJs1fM5jhnn7jaTru7f3rjkjhKfShkgksoHQtfTSLfo8RjRGfSfNqM9C2h3dMBjHsVdtrRv1VdstfsN6aqVe7nSoXiD4iJAc5Za6gUzZv72Wdg52tcsn5qkCbDUGyShT4dfoVbKwi19HjkUZ94S5C7VjPc3Kxvv7hsGz7yretj7j97bD6SBs2LzJb7vGh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon AWS S3</a> or <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2jeUyzVq98BcF5JtPUN4eCqpTcJAarE2AFxwCi1T18xEbaFSs7pDYG4iG1DutR3U6wGwmuAkfYpHsPqfkh44HtYDhC5wU4bWo8qcQGRJ457a5YsF6Nq8a8APrDiVQyamfXBD3iV6pSbarugXdiMDUBtfC9htKTG3G7st9dkxNZmZ9ihoS9qMsCTxsD25ctjc9eaTW16L7TAfpEEHkVsug2jg7T7mdA8iTDtkVV8b3Yy2wBAoiru4CeM2wdeoPfrvyeizpJt3csrwfkj89xsAwkR6qsa68gvWxrEQAaMjH6Jp9c7a9\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/2jeUyzVq98BcF5JtPUN4eCqpTcJAarE2AFxwCi1T18xEbaFSs7pDYG4iG1DutR3U6wGwmuAkfYpHsPqfkh44HtYDhC5wU4bWo8qcQGRJ457a5YsF6Nq8a8APrDiVQyamfXBD3iV6pSbarugXdiMDUBtfC9htKTG3G7st9dkxNZmZ9ihoS9qMsCTxsD25ctjc9eaTW16L7TAfpEEHkVsug2jg7T7mdA8iTDtkVV8b3Yy2wBAoiru4CeM2wdeoPfrvyeizpJt3csrwfkj89xsAwkR6qsa68gvWxrEQAaMjH6Jp9c7a9\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Backblaze B2</a>. You'll have to make the accounts separately and set them up manually, but once that's done, you're all set.

On the off chance I have downtime and only have my MacBook on me, I'll open up the Kindle app (it's less distracting than my phone). It syncs with your Amazon account, so you'll be able to pick up on the page you left off on your Kindle. As with the physical e-reader, you can customize the font, font size, layout, themes, and more. You'll also have access to the rest of your library, along with your notebook for anyone with a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/amazon-kindle-scribe-second-generation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kindle Scribe</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">I've been using Spotify for over a decade now and have never looked back.

Amazon’s Eero makes some of our favorite mesh systems, ideal for busy families seeking a set-and-forget mesh. The Pro 6E is a tri-band system with a 6-GHz band for fast Wi-Fi at close range, and with the jump to Wi-Fi 7 systems still costly, this system is worth considering right now. But you need an Eero Plus subscription at $10 per month or $100 per year to unlock the best features, including parental controls, advanced security, and ad blocking. There are discounts on other Eero systems, so check our Eero buying guide to decide which is best for your home. —Simon Hill\nDJI’s debut portable power station can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and boasts DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can juice up phones, run microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones because it can fast-charge most models. It gets a little noisy with several gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our best portable power stations guide. —Simon Hill\nThis is one of the best portable power stations for camping or road trips because it’s a manageable size. EcoFlow’s River 2 Pro has a LiFeP04 battery inside, which is good for 768 watt-hours. It has all the ports you need to charge your phones and other small gadgets, and the X-Boost surge enables it to power small appliances. You can charge it from an outlet or solar panels, though it takes more than an hour, and the fan can get a little noisy. —Simon Hill\nBuilt to last, this braided nylon cable’s exterior is 100 percent recycled plastic that Anker promises will last a century. It can operate in temperatures from -40 degrees to 176 degrees Fahrenheit. The ribbed cuffs make it easy to grip for plugging and unplugging, it has USB-IF certification, and it comes with a lifetime warranty. One of the best USB-C cables for charging a wide range of gadgets, the Anker Prime can supply up to 240 watts, making it suitable for laptops, smartphones, and anything else with a USB-C port. —Simon Hill\nThis is our favorite budget option in our guide to Best Webcams. Unlike the original version, it doesn’t come with an integrated right light but its software makes up for it with great automatic white balance and color saturation. It shoots 1080p resolution video at 30 frames per second or 720p resolution at 60 frames per second. Meanwhile the field of vision is a slightly wide 82 degrees. The built-in mics aren’t the best though, so we suggest sticking to the ones on your laptop or snag a USB microphone. You can also tinker with the video settings via the Razer Synapse app. —Brenda Stolyar\nFolks who receive loads of packages will appreciate Eufy’s dual camera doorbell, because it provides a view of your porch floor and front step, alongside the usual picture of whoever is calling. This is the best subscription-free option in our Best Video Doorbells guide, because there’s 8 GB of built-in storage for local recording and it can connect to a HomeBase 3 hub for more. The 2K footage is crisp and clear, and there’s on-device people, package, and even face detection, though it’s not always accurate, and this doorbell can be laggy when connecting away from home. —Simon Hill\nIf you don’t want to worry about batteries in your smart video doorbell, the Reolink Video Doorbell is a great option that lets you wire it into your home, letting it stay powered on for years to come. Reolink has a simple app, an included chime, plus built-in speakers and a microphone. The camera displays 2K video and records to a microSD card, so you don’t need a cloud storage fee like other doorbells. —Nena Farrell\nThis Qi2 power bank can wirelessly charge at up to 15 watts, but there’s also a built-in USB-C cable that can deliver up to 30 watts, and it supports several charging protocols (PD 3.0, PPS, and QC 3.0). There’s a wee kickstand to prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation for Apple's StandBy feature. It’s fairly slim and compact and will boost the battery inside most iPhones, or Qi2 Android phones, by around 50 to 80 percent. —Simon Hill\nHunting for the best portable chargers has led me to test hundreds of power banks, but this is my favorite. It looks great with a transparent, prism-shaped design, but it’s also extremely useful with a maximum output of 170 watts and a 24,000-mAh capacity, not to mention tough, with an IP66 rating for water resistance. It will fast charge just about any small gadget, from phones to laptops, and the handy wee display shows battery life as a percentage, time remaining, and the input or output in watts. —Simon Hill\nUgreen's charger can supply up to 145 watts (one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W), which very few power banks can do. The ample 25,000 mAh battery will keep all your gadgets topped up and is safe to fly with in your carry-on. It’s a solid option for fast-charging phones, tablets, or even laptops (although it doesn't support Samsung's fast-charging tech). A small LED shows the current charge state of the battery, and it comes with a USB-C cable. —Simon Hill\nI hate using clip-on reading lights because I always feel like they’re too top-heavy. So, I was excited to find this one that wraps around your neck. It’s lightweight and comfortable to wear for long reading sessions—once you get past how funny it looks. It also offers three color temperature modes including yellow, warm white, and cool. You’ll also have six brightness settings to pick from that you can cycle through with a button. It offers up to 80 hours of battery life at dimmer settings too. —Brenda Stolyar\nI’m not entirely sold on the necessity of XR (mixed reality) or augmented reality glasses. But Viture has done the best job of finding a legitimate use for them: a portable gaming display you can take anywhere. The original Viture One XR Glasses (6/10, WIRED Review) were okay, but the Viture Pro boasts a slightly larger virtual screen (135 inches), a smoother 120-Hz frame rate, and a far higher maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. Virtue has also done a nice job with the software, and the experience is tailored for gamers, though various accessories may be required, depending on your platform of choice. You can also use these glasses for multitasking work or watching movies, though the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. —Simon Hill\nIt may be bigger than some of the other best travel adapters, but this versatile gadget covers most of the globe, and offers two grounded US AC outlets, a built-in USB-C cable, two USB-A ports (15 watts total), and two USB-C ports (20 watts each). There is surge protection, but this is not a voltage converter. Unfortunately, the two AC outlets are close together, so the size of some plugs can make it challenging to use both simultaneously. But with the ability to charge up to seven devices, this is worth packing in your suitcase. —Simon Hill\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\nBest Amazon Device Deals\nWhen Amazon updated its entire Kindle lineup, that did not exclude the Kindle versions for kids. My kids have tested the Kindle kids’ versions since they came out in 2019, and to my eye, the new Kindle Kids and Kindle Kids Paperwhite are both noticeably faster and clearer than the old versions. If you’re spending all your money buying comic books, I suggest the Kindle Kids Paperwhite, which is bigger and better for reading graphic novels. It’s also waterproof and, like all Amazon kid devices, comes with a two-year worry-free warranty. —Adrienne So\nThis is the best Kindle (8/10, WIRED Review) for note-taking and reading. It comes with a 10.2-inch (300 ppi) paperlike display, white borders that mimic writing on a traditional piece of paper, and a Premium Pen that has a soft-tipped eraser similar to that of a No. 2 pencil. It also packs features like Active Canvas (where you can write directly within the book you’re reading), expandable margins, and a couple of artificial intelligence tools including Refined Writing (that transforms your notes into a script font) and Summarization (which summarizes your notes). —Brenda Stolyar\nThis is the best Amazon tablet for younger children. It has all the same features as Amazon’s standard Fire tablets, but you’ll also get a rugged case and a two-year replacement guarantee. It also comes with a free year of Amazon Kids+, which gives you access to kid-friendly movies, books, apps, and games. You can manage the parental controls on the device as well. —Scott Gilbertson\nThe main difference between the Fire HD Kids and Fire HD Kids Pro tablets is the protective case. The Pro version has a less protective case and is aimed at older kids less likely to drop it. The Pro version still has the same two-year warranty though, so if it does hit the floor, you’re covered. —Scott Gilbertson\nThe Fire HD 10 Pro Kid’s Edition is the same as the normal Fire HD 10, but it comes with a handy protective case (with kickstand), one year of Amazon Kids+, and, most importantly, a no-questions-asked warranty for when your kids accidentally drop it. Parental controls on Amazon’s tablets are limited but offer some control over content (see our guide for more details). —Scott Gilbertson\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\nBest Home Deals\nThis cute little smart plug works with every smart home speaker you could hope for, letting you invest without worrying that it won’t work for whichever voice assistant you might fancy in the future. It’s my favorite smart plug for Apple HomeKit users, though it’ll work well for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant users, too. It’s got a nice small form factor so you won’t block the other outlet, and this four-pack makes it easy to transform an entire room (or a small apartment) into a full smart home. —Nena Farrell\nThis extreme alarm clock is truly one of the most annoying things I’ve ever dealt with. Which is a good thing if you need something to motivate you to get your butt out of bed. This robotlike alarm clock on wheels rolls away from you, falling from whatever surface you put it on and randomly rolls wherever (under your bed, behind your dresser—all of the hardest places to reach), so you’re forced to physically get out of bed and turn it off. Right now, it’s the lowest price we’ve seen all year. If you’re like me and have slept through a fire alarm, it's a solid way to get you moving in the morning. —Molly Higgins\nThe Roxicosly clock is one of the most reviewed nontraditional alarm clocks on Amazon. It’s semi-customizable, with the buzzer going up to 106 decibels and a bed shaker that can be used separately or together with the alarm. The vibrations provide a more subtle way to wake up by forgoing the jarring alarm sounds, and the escalating pattern of the buzzing helps ease the snoozer into wakefulness. The vibrations, along with the noise and adjustable intensity, helped me wake up more easily than other buzzing alarms I’ve tried, and at $18, it’s one of the lowest prices we’ve seen for it this year. —Molly Higgins\nTushy makes some of the best budget electric bidets, and the Classic 3.0 is a great choice for any bathroom—renters included—since it’s a small accessory that doesn’t require any additional power and can be added to just about any toilet. For having no electricity added, it’s got impressive water power and a nice range of finishes so you can select the one that best matches your bathroom’s vibe. —Nena Farrell\nThe Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is one of our favorite Dyson vacuums overall. It’s got a wet roller head and drip tray built in, which makes it both a vacuum and a mop. It can clean about 1,000 square feet on one charge and water tank fill, with up to an hour of run time and around 4.5 hours to recharge the battery. If you want a wet/dry vacuum that isn’t a robot, this is a great deal on Dyson’s offering. —Louryn Strampe\nTrue Classic’s white tee is snug in the right places, and relaxed everywhere else. Editor Jeremy White appreciates the “dad bod” fit and says the neckline is just right. WIRED UK managing editor Mike Dent admits he’d probably wear it to death as pajamas. It is a 60/40 cotton-poly bend, meaning it’s not the most sustainable choice and is more likely to pill. Still, at $25, it’s a solid tee that won’t make you look like an extra in an early aughts music video. —Boutayna Chokrane\nI recently wrote an article about how much I love Comfort Colors t-shirts, which are slowly displacing every other t-shirt in my closet. Doing so is not exactly cost-prohibitive at their standard offering price of around $10 on Amazon, but the Big Spring Sale is dropping them a bit. It's like getting a free shirt for every five you buy! —Martin Cizmar\nThey’re soft. They’re fun. They’re serotonin for your feet. These TikTok-approved smiley slippers are designed with memory foam cushioning, a fuzzy upper, and a nonslip sole for padding inside and outside the house. They’re not the most durable, but for $13, they’ll keep your toes cozy and your mood (hopefully slightly) boosted. —Boutayna Chokrane\nDyson loves to make beautiful, techy-looking, almost self-consciously expensive devices. This is why I’d always recommend waiting for a good sale before buying one. Luckily, this is a doozy, knocking $200 off the list price on one of our favorite portable heaters and fans. This model is basically an all-things-to-all people air-changing doohickey par excellence. The HP07 is a space heater with an energy-saving, accurate thermostat that’ll also work as a fan, an air quality monitor, and an air purifying filter. It’s a little loud if you turn the fan up, but among portable space heaters, it’s also the most sophisticated air management system I’ve tested. —Matthew Korfhage\nWe are now approaching the great robot vacuum convergence, where all manufacturers agree that somewhere between $500 and $1,000 is the sweet spot for a multifunctional robot vacuum mop. The Eufy X10 Pro Omni was our top pick in this spot last year, but it got edged out by slightly cheaper models; still, at the sale price, this is still a great robot vacuum whose AI navigation helps it map quickly and efficiently (and provides some comic relief in the process). —Adrienne So\nYeedi is the affordable sub-brand of Ecovacs, which also makes many robot vacuums that we like. The company offers a broad array of robot vacuum/mops at a wide range of prices. This one is the midrange model, and I did find that it navigated better than the cheaper versions. There are a few other standout features besides the very good price—the clean/dirty water tanks are absolutely ginormous, so you can go much longer without refilling them, and it has an extendable arm to get in all the little nooks and crannies. —Adrienne So\nTineco makes some great floor cleaning gadgets—I was vacuuming my entire house with the Pure One Station 5 before writing this—including a fantastic carpet cleaner. The Tineco Carpet One Pro is our favorite upgrade-worthy carpet cleaner, but it’s on sale right now for nearly half the price, making it the perfect time to snap one up for yourself. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano describes the Carpet One Pro as as much fun as you can hope from a carpet cleaner, with a clever design that leaves the dirty water tank upright while you maneuver the cleaner and a big LED screen to see what mode you’re in. There’s an Auto, Max, and Drying mode, and it can leave white carpet looking like it’s brand-new. —Nena Farrell\nAutomatic curtains are a great way to wake up in the morning with natural light and to keep the heat in or out if you live somewhere sunny. The trouble is they tend to be very expensive. Retrofit solutions, like this third-generation SwitchBot device, make them far more affordable. It is easy to fit and works well if you have the right drapes. This is our pick of the best retrofit options for automatic curtains in our Best Smart Shades guide. Just keep in mind that you need two for a pair of curtains. —Simon Hill\nAfina has two main benefits among the new crop of filtered showerheads that promise to filter the chlorine out of the water that reaches your skin and hair. The first is its broad, flat showerhead that offers a lovely, even, spalike spray. The second is that unlike most of the showerheads I tested, Afina works quite well for the entire duration of its filter life. In part, this is because they recommend filter replacement every two months instead of every three months, at $30 a pop. But from our testing, this frequency amounts to a rare honesty. —Matthew Korfhage\nAfter testing more than a dozen filters from a new generation of filtered showerhead brands, I can say this handsome little number from Canopy was one of the very few that could bring my total chlorine down to undetectable levels on my chloramine-treated water system. The filter—a mix of KDF-55, calcium sulfite, and granular activated carbon made from coconut shells—retains about half its efficacy throughout the three-month life of the filter, not a bad record compared to others I’ve tested. What’s more, the thoughtful design offers easy installation, adjustable spray, and even aromatherapy diffusers if that’s your steez. This is almost the lowest price we’ve seen over the past 12 months, and the handheld version is also on sale. —Matthew Korfhage\nThis family favorite frequently comes out when we have people over because it’s so easy to pick up and play, and it’s fun. Each round is based on a single word from a category card determined by a dice roll, but while everyone else knows the word, the chameleon has to bluff their way through. Each player says something associated with the word for that round, and the guesser has to decide who the chameleon is. It’s for up to eight players but is still fun for spectators. —Simon Hill\nThis body pillow is marketed for pregnant people, but as a non-pregnant person who is an exclusive side sleeper, it worked well for me. The pillow combines popular body- and pregnancy-pillow U and C shapes for a unique shape that provides total-body support no matter which side you sleep on—Momcozy even claims it helps those with pain like sciatica and fibromyalgia. Because of its unique shape that’s got your head and limbs covered, and at less than 40 bucks, this is really the only pillow you’ll need. Insider tip: It comes in multiple cover types, so I’d opt for a lighter cotton fabric cover if you sleep hot. —Molly Higgins\nThe Loftie Alarm Clock (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the prettiest bedside gadgets I’ve tried. The sleek alarm clock pairs with an app to let you create your alarms and access a variety of audio content to fall asleep to. There’s even a membership ($6 a month) that gives you access to personalized bedtime stories, meditations, and even your horoscope. There are also plenty of other standard sounds, like white noise and campfires, that you can access without the membership. The Loftie Alarm also has a little nightlight built into it that you can tap on and off, but it is pretty dim so it won’t double as a lamp or bedside light. Overall, it’s a really fun alarm clock, and it pairs with the beautiful Loftie Lamp (sadly not on sale) to become a sunrise alarm setup. —Nena Farrell\nThis is my favorite wearable breast pump I’ve ever tried. The Willow Go (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is well priced for a wearable breast pump and works great, and the clear exterior makes it easy to keep an eye on how your pump session is going. It has its own app from Willow, and you can also purchase Willow’s bras that are made to help hold a wearable pump. The pieces are nice and big making it easy to clean without losing something down the drain. It’s a bit of a splurge, though it’s often on sale for $280 (so this is still a better deal than you’d usually find!) —Nena Farrell\nThese sleep sacks from Kyte Baby are one of my all-time favorite pieces of baby gear. Sleep blankets are a great choice to keep babies who can roll over warm without having to worry about their airways getting obstructed by a blanket, since it keeps the blanket firmly on their body and below their feet and away from their faces. I have so many of these, all for different seasons, since these come in different thermal overall grades (or TOG). Kyte Baby has a handy little chart here to see match weight with temperature. They’re super long, which I loved, so my tall baby wasn’t constantly growing out of them. —Nena Farrell\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\nBest Home Office Deals\nThis is our budget recommendation in our Best Standing Desks guide. The EN1 has a somewhat complicated assembly but once it’s put together, it’s a reliable and affordable standing desk that does the job. You get four memory presets so that the desk can remember your favorite heights, and it can hold up to 154 pounds. —Julian Chokkattu\nI love this tiny table. The frame is designed so that you can roll it under a bed or couch and the desktop will still be easy to access. You can raise it up and down via a lever manually, and the whole thing is on wheels so moving it around is a piece of cake. I’ve been using it for several years as a place for a little photo studio, with clamped-on lights, and it has worked flawlessly. It can hold 15 pounds. —Julian Chokkattu\nThis little desk accessory comes with magnetic clips you can attach to your cables. Those clips can then stay affixed to the magnetic base, which makes this a neat-freak’s solution to organizing those pesky wires. There’s a bigger version in case you have lots of cables at your desk or nightstand. —Julian Chokkattu\nWith a whopping 1 TB of storage, this handy SSD drive from SK Hynix is not much bigger than the other best USB Flash drives. It is a bit chunkier, since it has an M.2 drive inside, but it can hit impressive speeds (around 1,000 MB/s read, 900 MB/s write) with the right gear (USB 3.2 Gen 2 port). I use it to watch 4K movies on my LG TV, and it can slot into an Xbox Series X/S or PlayStation 4 or 5 for extra game storage. Finished in smooth black plastic, with a cover that pops off to reveal a USB-A jack, SK Hynix offers a three-year warranty. —Simon Hill\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\nBest Kitchen Deals\nAny ol’ carbonator can carbonate. But this is a carbonator from Ninja, and so this one can’t merely add bubbles. It must also offer multiple levels of carbonation, and infuse your water with functional B-vitamin flavor pods that taste like dragonfruit or watermelon kiwi and promise to “hydrate” or fill you with energy. Anyway, it’s $50 off for the spring sale. And while we did like the SodaStream Enso more, this one costs half as much. —Matthew Korfhage\nWIRED contributing reviewer Lisa Wood Shapiro was quite the fan (no pun intended) of this rectangular dehydrator’s fast mode—so much so that she crowned it Best for Those in a Hurry in our guide to the Best Food Dehydrators. It dried apple slices, kiwis, and banana chips in half the time of a typical dehydrator cycle, as viewable through the machine’s large glass window. Lisa was also impressed by its quiet fan and dishwasher-safe stainless steel trays. As the longtime owner of a Nesco dehydrator with infuriatingly difficult-to-clean plastic trays, I can confirm the trays alone make this a worthwhile investment. —Kat Merck\nThere’s a lot to like about this excellent-value bread machine, top pick in our guide to the Best Bread Makers. It’s got all the same bells and whistles as higher-end models, including 17 preset programs, a delay timer, and a fruit-and-nut dispenser, and it can turn out loaves in three different sizes, as opposed to the usual one or two. Its ceramic pan is free of nonstick coatings and potential PFOAs and can be run through the dishwasher for easy cleaning. The recipe book leaves something to be desired in terms of variety and readability (and quality of the recipes in general—I recommend looking elsewhere online; some KBS-owning Redditors have had success with King Arthur recipes). The stirring/kneading cycle is also louder than it needs to be, but otherwise, this is a worry-free choice if you’re in the market for set-it-and-forget it homemade bread. —Kat Merck\nLook, for sheer performance, we might go with a KitchenAid. But for value, we already recommend this Aucma even at full price. It goes on sale fairly often, but this is a better deal than most on this 1,400-watt device, which boasts useful little features like a splash guard on its tilt head, and basic functions like six speeds and a pulse function. Attachments include whisk, beater, and dough hook, plus a 6-liter and 5-liter bowl. If you just want a mixer that’ll bother some batter, and you don’t want to spend $200-plus on top-line stand mixers and all their elegant frippery, this is your little lower-priced stand mixer workhorse, briefly priced even lower. —Matthew Korfhage\nThe Breville Smart Oven Pro is the workhorse model in Breville’s lineup of Lexus toaster ovens, hanging out at the sweet spot of affordability and execution. It’s one I’ll recommend to those who want a Breville oven but balk at the price of the top-pick Joule: It heats evenly, keeps temperature beautifully, and offers a standard array of baking, toasting, broiling, and light convection that nonetheless definitely is not air frying. The slight curve in its geometry means you can fit a 13-inch pizza pan inside, a 5-quart Dutch oven, or a 12-by-12 square pan. Anyway, Breville doles out sales sparingly, and this little corker is $50 off for the spring sale. —Matthew Korfhage\nThis little countertop pizza oven made the rounds on TikTok last year for being so cute, compact, and relatively affordable. Astonishingly, its claims of heating to 800 degrees Fahrenheit on the top and bottom heating element are accurate and it takes about 15 minutes! The top heating element doesn’t cover the whole pizza and it loses heat very quickly, since it opens like a waffle maker. Still, this is a nice housewarming present for a pizza lover. I also use it to heat up tortillas and pitas for dinner. —Adrienne So\nIt’s not a secret: AeroPress is the best and easiest and most lovely coffee maker that can fit in a literal pocket, assuming you’ve got deep pockets. The original version is already the default option for countless hotel room and campsite self-caffeinators. The newer Go travel version is even more lightweight, self-contained, and remains beautifully customizable to your own perfect taste. For now, it’s quite a bit cheaper: more than a third off the list price. —Matthew Korfhage\nThis stainless steel beauty goes on sale reasonably often, but this is still a great deal on a handsome stainless steel French press that forgoes both microplastics and frangible glass (whose shards shall henceforth be referred to as micro-glass.) I’ve been hunting down non-plastic alternatives for pretty much everything in my kitchen: With everything made of steel right down to the coffee maker filters, Mueller is a strong entrant on my list, and WIRED’s favorite pick among stainless steel French press. —Matthew Korfhage\nI found these ramekins to be supremely helpful while testing meal kits for work. You see TV chefs using tiny ramekins and bowls all the time, and as it turns out, they know what they’re doing. Whipping up a compound butter? Tiny bowls! Zesting a lemon before juicing it? Tiny bowls. Separating the white and green halves of a green onion? Tiny. Bowls. They’re also handy when baking individual desserts, such as the lava cakes my partner became obsessed with last year. Get some tiny bowls! —Louryn Strampe\nThe Instant Pot Vortex Plus is the best air fryer we’ve tried. This usually sells for between $140 and $90, and we’ve only seen it drop below this price a few times before. It keeps temperature precisely and it manages to crisp up food without stripping away moisture. The basket preheats quickly and the simple display is intuitive. Reviewer Matthew Korfhage also appreciated the fact that the controls don’t beep—the simple dial keeps things quiet.\nThis is a good deal on our favorite waiter’s corkscrew. But wait: Did you not know that some corkscrews are better than others? They are! Aside from the unique rightness of how this one feels in your hand, this HiCoup offers a wire atop its hinge to create a springlike motion as you brace it, a small comfort that ends up mattering. The device is made of solid metal and actual wood, with fine detailing for grip. Its knife is sharp. And right now, the HiCoup’s price is a third of what Le Creuset is charging for our second-favorite waiter’s corkscrew. —Matthew Korfhage\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\nBest Beauty Deals\nThis consistently popular hair-straightening comb was not the answer for members of our team with super thick and curly hair, but for those whose hair is easy to straighten or simply wavy, it’s definitely worth considering for the price and ease of use. The outer shell that covers the hot teeth is safer than a traditional flat iron and enables users to get closer to their roots than they would otherwise, which is great for tamping down flyaways. The brush is also reasonably lightweight at under 1 pound, in case you’d want to use it for travel. Also note that it comes with a black-and-pink heat-resistant glove, which apparently is to use on your hair and not actually on the tool, as former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found out the hard way. —Kat Merck\nThis is the original “upgrade” hair straightener that changed the flat iron game for many (including myself) when it was released in 2006, and it’s still going strong today. Former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber tried it for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners and says it still lives up to the hype. It only heats to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, but it does so in seconds and requires minimal passes. Woollaston-Webber says the outer plastic does get hot while styling, so it may not be the best pick for younger users, but if that doesn’t bother you this is still the best deal on a solid hair straightener you’ll find for $50. —Kat Merck\nThe Aquasonic Black Series is not for the weak-gummed. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found the vibrations a little overwhelming—the whole body buzzes more than the bristles themselves. But if you love that ultra-deep-clean sensation, this is a steal at $30. Plus, you get eight replacement heads, which would cost more than the brush itself with some brands. If you’d prefer a gentler toothbrush, you might be better off with a Sonicare or Bitvae, which are also on sale. —Boutayna Chokrane\nThe Tymo Airflow is a great two-in-one tool, letting you both curl and straighten your hair with the same device. I love it for my fine hair, and I think it shines best as a straightener, though it can do some nice soft curls. There’s 3D floating plates, a ceramic finish, and a rounded form factor that makes it look like a curler, but opens up like a straightener. There’s five heat options ranging from 284 to 428 degrees Fahrenheit, and Tymo has a guide on which to choose based on your hair type. —Nena Farrell\nIf oscillating toothbrushes feel too intense on your gums, the Philips Sonicare 4100 Electric Toothbrush is a gentler powerhouse. You get a pressure sensor that reduces vibrations when you’re brushing too hard, a two-minute timer, and two intensity settings (low and high). A single charge lasts about two weeks, and it’s designed with BrushSync technology that tracks how long (and hard) you’ve been brushing and will remind you when it’s time to replace the head. Normally $50—now $40—this is the best midrange electric toothbrush we’ve tested. —Boutayna Chokrane\nIf you’re still scraping your tongue with your toothbrush, it’s time for MasterMedi Tongue Scraper. This stainless steel scraper is way more effective, easier to clean, and won’t snap in half like plastic versions. This two-pack comes with individual cases (one for home, one for your travel kit). While it’s technically dishwasher-safe, just rinse it like an adult. At $8, it’s a small price to pay for a fresher mouth. —Boutayna Chokrane\nManscaped is more famous for its groin-taming Lawn Mower trimmer, but never-nudes take heart: You can keep it above the neck with a Beard Hedger whose small stainless steel teeth and high RPMs make it great for shorter beards, according to WIRED contributing reviewer Andrew Williams. A small amount of give in the trimmer’s plastic guide means the Hedger offers a quite close shave. While this isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen, 25 percent off is a solid deal on this trimmer. —Matthew Korfhage\nThe Fancii Abigail (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite lighted makeup mirror for traveling. It measures nearly 8 inches across, and it’s easy to transport in a backpack or weekender. Unfurl the flat disc to reveal a mirror that can be used compact-style or raised on a stand and angled in all sorts of directions. The ring light around the mirror is bright, but it doesn’t take up too much of the reflective surface, and there are three light temperature settings to choose from. The interface is simple, and the mirror stays closed reliably. It also recharges quickly via USB-C, and the battery lasts about 10 hours on one charge. If you’re frequently applying your makeup on the go, or you’re sick of terrible hotel bathroom lighting ruining your glam, this price is too good to pass up (in my personal and very experienced opinion). —Louryn Strampe\nThe Fancii Taylor is the best lighted makeup mirror out there. The compact-style mirror measures 5 inches across—so it’s bigger than traditional compacts and better suited for a larger purse than a pocket. One side has 1x magnification and the other side has 10x magnification, so you’ll be able to see up close even if you’re doing your makeup on the go. There are three lighting temperatures to choose from and the battery lasts for about a month before needing to be topped off via USB-C (which takes about an hour). —Louryn Strampe\nIf TikTok’s raving about it, I’m skeptical, but experts back this trend up. Snail mucin is packed with glycoproteins and hyaluronic acid—but don’t expect overnight miracles. This gooey essence hydrates, soothes, and leaves skin looking plump without feeling greasy. I slather on the Cosrx Advanced Snail Mucin 96 Percent Power Repairing Essence Serum nightly after cleansing. At $18, it’s a decent time to snag a bottle or stock up, though we’ve seen the price dip lower before. —Boutayna Chokrane\nThese cute little stars that went viral on TikTok are hydrocolloid patches that can help heal pimples. The material attracts water, which helps flatten zits and suck out all the gross stuff inside them. It’s weirdly satisfying to use them, and it’s also empowering, transforming a blemish into an accessory. Pimple patches are usually affordable. The reason I personally like and use Starface patches is because they come in a cute storage case with a little mirror, which helps when I feel hormonal acne cropping up while I’m out and about. Refills are affordable, too. —Louryn Strampe\nMicellar water is a godsend for those people who are sometimes too lazy to fully wash their faces at night. (It’s me, I’m people.) Simply douse a cotton pad with this magical solution and swipe it over your face for easy makeup removal and a cleaner feeling than oil-based makeup wipes can provide. I especially like using this sensitive-skin formula for travel since I don’t have to rinse my face after using it, making it ideal for camping trips or overnight car rides. I first received it in a beauty box, but it’s affordable and easy to find (and I don’t have to pour my fancy cleanser into a TSA-approved bottle, either). —Louryn Strampe\nI admit I had never before seen or heard of Electrolit until a recent family summer vacation in Las Vegas, when my husband, son, and I made the ill-fated decision to walk the entirety of the Strip during a 115-degree-Fahrenheit heat wave. The Pedialyte-looking bottle was an immediate grab from the cooler at Target, and not only tasted like fruit punch, it quite literally saved my life. The powdered packets taste similar, if not a bit stronger, with vivid hues from artificial food coloring. The company has been around for more than 70 years—before Liquid IV, before even Pedialyte—so if you’re looking for an electrolyte beverage that both looks and tastes like the ’80s, this is your chance to score a great deal on an eight-pack. —Kat Merck\nThis topped our list of the Best Smart Scales. It quickly and accurately assesses not only your weight but your heart rate, fat and muscle measurements, vascular age, and more. The companion smartphone app is also easy to use. The scale can track data for up to eight users, and the AAA batteries last for over a year. If you’re trying to keep an eye on how your body changes over time, this scale is an investment worth considering. —Louryn Strampe\nIf you’ve been eyeing a Theragun but can’t stomach the price tag, a massage gun under $50 is almost unheard of. The LifePro Sonic also comes with an absurd number of attachments (eight): a round head for sore muscles, a shovel for back pain, a flat tip for a deep tissue massage, a pointer for sensitive knots, a bullet for small muscles, a fingertip for trigger points, spinal for lower back, and a textured tip for larger muscles. It’s not the lightest at 2.5 pounds, but for the price, this tool is an excellent addition to your gym setup or post-workout recovery routine. —Boutayna Chokrane\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\nBest Mobile Phone Deals (Plus Accessories)\nThe Nubia Redmagic 10 Pro (7/10, WIRED Review) is a mobile gaming beast with excellent battery life, silky performance, and a lovely 6.8-inch screen with a 144-Hz refresh rate. Relatively affordable for a phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, this device is all about gaming and includes a built-in fan to keep cool, programmable buttons, and highly customizable gaming software. Shoddy software, limited updates, and an inconsistent camera are downsides, but this is real value for gamers, especially at the discounted price. —Simon Hill\nThe best smart display to invest in isn’t technically a smart display, but a tablet. The Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is an Android tablet with a speaker docking station, letting it transform into a powerful little smart display when you aren’t using the tablet. It’s got good performance, a sharp LCD screen, and robust speakers. Both the tablet with the docking station and the tablet alone are on sale, but this tablet really shines when you’re able to use it all day long. It’s a better deal for the included speaker, too, versus the tablet alone. The Google Pixel has been running my smart home devices for months, and I have no desire to go back to a smart-display-only gadget in my house. —Nena Farrell\nThis is our favorite ultrathin case in our guide to the Best iPhone 16 cases. It’s composed of 100 percent biodegradable packaging with a woven aramid fiber that adds a super soft feel. Despite its thin design, it comes with MagSafe built in, too. It also comes in some fun patterns. It’s worth noting the buttons are exposed, so if that’s a concern, I suggest going for another case. This one will keep the back of your phone safe from scratches, but it won’t do much to protect your display if you drop it. —Brenda Stolyar\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\nBest Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers)\nIt has occasionally dipped a little lower, but this is a solid price on Samsung’s latest smartwatch. It’s best paired with a Samsung phone to access a few extra features, like the electrocardiogram and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, but will otherwise work with all Android phones. Performance is smooth, the health tracking is excellent, but battery life is a little annoying—it’ll just about enough to get through a day, not much more. I recommend grabbing the 44-mm variant; it’s a bit bigger but that means better battery life. —Julian Chokkattu\nTesting Google’s Pixel Watch 3 is the first time I believed editor Julian Chokkattu when he said “round is better than square.” It’s one of the best-looking smartwatches and one of the best-looking fitness trackers for anyone with an Android phone. I recommend staying with this larger 45-mm model for better battery life, especially if you work out a lot. I have mixed feelings about the AI coaching features, but Fitbit is still one of the best fitness platforms available and Google’s integration with it is virtually perfect. —Adrienne So\nWant a big, premium smartwatch for your Android phone? Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Ultra (7/10, WIRED Review) is the Apple Watch Ultra equivalent, with a beefy screen and battery. It has better navigational features like Track Back and a compass to accurately find your way back to camp, and you get two days of battery life—extendable if you turn on power saving mode. You can even submerge it up to 100 meters. —Julian Chokkattu\nThe Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) headlines our Best Fitness Trackers guide thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. It has been cheaper, but this is a decent discount. —Simon Hill\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\nBest TV Deals (Plus Streaming Devices)\nThis tiny little 1080p projector from XGIMI is one of my favorite portable projectors because it’s so easy to set up. You can get a battery-impregnated stand and plug it straight into the projector, which is about the size and shape of a Stanley water cup. It has a cute little speaker on the bottom and can even flip up to shoot images at the ceiling, which makes it fun to add ambience when you’re not watching shows and movies. —Parker Hall\nBest Speaker Deals\nBeats took its time renewing its popular Pill Bluetooth speaker, but the wait was worth it. The latest Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a posh design, great sound, and loads of features, from solid water resistance to a USB-C input for lossless audio playback. Its zippy sound signature goes heavy on the bass and treble but both are presented with care and musicality, and its mix of keen instrumental textures and stereo separation place it among the top performers in its class. The Pill’s stylish frame isn’t as drop-friendly as rivals from JBL or UE, but at $100 this is an easy decision for anyone eyeing a solid Bluetooth buddy. —Ryan Waniata\nThese perfectly sized speakers will bring a rich, clear sound to your desktop. They come in black or white with angled stands to fire the audio into your ears. Our current pick of the best computer speakers under $200, the M60 speakers are already a bargain, so this discount makes them irresistible for anyone in the market. While they offer decent bass, it can get a bit muddy, and the touch controls are slightly annoying, but that’s it for weaknesses. Connectivity choices include USB-C (which will be best for most folks), 3.5 mm, or Bluetooth 5.3. —Simon Hill\nThe Everboom is a solid offering from Ultimate Ears, one of our favorite Bluetooth speaker makers. The only real issue I took with the speaker in my Everboom review is that its sound quality and features are remarkably similar to the Megaboom 4, which costs $50 less. Issue resolved! If you’re looking for a powerful and uniquely designed Bluetooth speaker with loads of extras to pump up your outdoor jams, at $200 or less the Everboom is a solid choice. —Ryan Waniata\nThis isn’t a sale so much as the new regular price, but anytime you can get this speaker at $60 or less it’s well worth considering. I like its smooth and warm sound that pays good attention to detail. I love its ultra-portable design that easily clips to shower attachments, branches, belt loops, etc. The Clip is durable and its IP67 dust and water resistance means it works easily as well as a shower speaker or chilling at the beach. —Ryan Waniata\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\nBest Headphone Deals\nThese cheap buds from Nothing are some of our favorite earbuds under $100. They have excellent design; a comfortable, Airpods Pro-like fit; and quality sound and noise canceling technology. If you’re after a pair that look good and that you don’t need to worry about, start here. —Parker Hall\nIf you own an Android phone, this is a fantastic pair of cheap earbuds (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to pair with it. They quick-pair to all Android devices, and they have a super comfortable and stable design that will keep them in your ears even during the most strenuous workouts. I also like the charging case, which is a cute little egg that slides easily into pockets and bags. —Parker Hall\nSoundcore’s Liberty 4 NC (8/10, WIRED Recommends) aren’t just another AirPods clone. They’re another AirPods Pro clone, and a good one at that, offering excellent battery life, clear and detailed sound, and tons of customization options at a fraction of what you’ll pay for Apple’s best buds. You’re not getting Apple’s exclusive features, of course, but if you want a great experience with stem-style buds for less, this is one of my favorite pairs. The customization in Soundcore’s app alone is nearly worth the entry fee, and the buds themselves are well-built and comfy. I had a few problems with the touch controls, but otherwise it’s hard to criticize buds that rise above their price point in nearly every way that counts. —Ryan Waniata\nWe see this discount frequently, but we’d be remiss not to include it here since it’s the best deal we see for the best headphones we’ve tried. Of the dozens, if not hundreds, of pairs of headphones our reviewers have tested, the WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take the cake in terms of battery life (30 hours), sound quality (thanks to Sony processing and 30-mm drivers), and noise cancelation (complete with automatic audio pausing).—Louryn Strampe\nThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are the best wireless earbuds for Android owners. They’re small and cute, with a supremely comfortable fit and fantastic noise canceling. The battery lasts for eight hours and the sound quality is great, too. They even have IP54 water resistance, so you can take ’em to the gym. It’s not hard to find a good inexpensive pair of earbuds these days, but we don’t see these go on sale very often, making now a better time to pick them up.—Louryn Strampe\nI’ve said it before and I’ll say it many times again, I’m sure: Anker’s Soundcore line makes a mean budget headphone. The Space A40 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) noise-canceling buds are longtime favorites for their mix of clear and full sound, solid mid-tier noise cancelation, and plenty of features rolled into a comfy design. The biggest argument against these buds is their lack of auto-pause, which means you’ll need to stay on your toes when you pull a bud out during your favorite true crime podcast. Otherwise, it’s hard to argue against their value, especially since their price has sunk like a stone to nearly half their original MSRP. —Ryan Waniata\nA sale on the Life Q30 is really just doubling down on value. Even at full price, these rank among the best noise-canceling headphones I’ve tested for the money. Along with solid noise canceling, highlights include a comfy design, a great companion app, and up to 40 hours of playtime. I’ve taken these headphones on a cross-country flight and had no trouble enjoying my favorite music and movies thanks to their ability to quell engine drone and background noise. The soft plastic tends to scratch easily and they don’t have all the features of top models like the Bose QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) or Sony XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but at a fraction of the cost, they’re a guilt-free budget buy. —Ryan Waniata\nThis is a less exciting deal now that the new Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 have come out. But if you’re an Apple user who doesn’t want to spend $250, then Beats’ previous headphones topped our Best Workout Headphones guide for years. (When they were released, we even called them “Apple’s best earbuds ever.”) They’re insanely comfortable, have great battery life and an excellent sound signature, work well with all Apple devices, and despite a modest IPX4 rating, are hardy and durable. I dunked my head under a hose at full blast while wearing them and they were fine. —Adrienne So\nIf I had to buy my own workout headphones instead of testing them, I would probably buy a pair of the Shokz OpenRuns in any of the company’s models, whether it’s this, the original OpenRun, or the OpenRun mini, for people who have smaller necks. These headphones are just leagues away in terms of build and sound quality than the other competitors of this type, they fit under a helmet for biking and skateboarding, and the newest version has USB-C charging so you don’t have to hunt for that dumb proprietary cable anymore. —Adrienne So\nIf you work out in a busy city, or you’re cycling to work and need to hear the cars on the road around you, open bone-conduction headphones like the OpenRun Pro are a good option that allow you to still enjoy your tunes. This is an older model from 2022 (8/10, WIRED Recommends), but it still works great for most folks, especially at this discounted price. —Parker Hall\nBose isn’t in the business of making the second-best noise-canceling headphones. When it comes to crushing your sonic annoyances to a pulp, nobody beats the QC Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends). These headphones offer rich and clear sound, plush comfort in a posh design, and the best noise canceling you can get for your money. Whether transforming traffic to a whisper or dialing back irksome vocal chatter and even barking dogs, the QC Ultra are the best we’ve tested with a price tag to match. They even offer extras like a transparency mode limiter to keep loud noises from hurting your ears. This is one of the better QC Ultra sales we’ve seen, so if you’re ready to enjoy the silence Depeche Mode style, now’s a good time. —Ryan Waniata\nThe Studio Buds Plus were among the first earbuds to show Beats had truly turned the corner on a new audio era. They’re not the best noise-canceling buds around but they’ve got a cool look, solid performance, and a handy swath of features for both Android and Apple phones. Maybe most notable is their dial design which makes the buds incredibly easy to insert and control, both real-life conveniences that often get overlooked by reviewers and buyers alike. I wouldn’t suggest you buy the Studio Plus at full price these days, but they’re usually on sale well below their retail cost and right now they're particularly tempting. —Ryan Waniata\nThis is one of my favorite AirPods cases, specifically because it comes with magnets that support MagSafe accessories. Of course, it’s protective too, with a shock-absorbing hard shell along with top and bottom pieces that shut via magnets (which helps keep the lid from accidentally sliding off). It’s bulkier than other cases I’ve used, but it’s not enough to be a deal-breaker. It also comes in a really cute pink color. It’s compatible with AirPods Pro (1st and 2nd generation) and AirPods (4th generation) —Brenda Stolyar\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\nBest Pet Deals\nThe Chom Chom roller is like a thing of magic. Half of us on the Gear desk swear by it. The viral TikTok gadget crushes fur and lint like nothing else. Simply pass it over a surface a few times, back and forth, and be amazed at how quickly and thoroughly it gets rid of pet fur. It’s easy to empty, too. Press the button on the back side of the roller and get rid of the fur inside. It’s infinitely reusable—I’ve owned one for nearly six years and it’s still going strong. I like to keep it on the coffee table so I can quickly de-fluff my furniture if guests pop by—because we all know I’m not going to be kicking my cat off the sofa. (She especially knows this.) —Louryn Strampe\nThis cat DNA test is one of our favorite pieces of cat gear you can buy. Technically, all cats are polycats, but I thought it was neat to see the primary species markers that my cat Luna carries since she adopted me off the street. This test also checks your cat’s DNA against over 100 feline health markers, testing for risk levels regarding kidney health, cardiovascular conditions, and more. It’s not as comprehensive as a human DNA test, but I have zero regrets. —Louryn Strampe\nA top pick in our guide to the Best Cat Water Fountains, this 2.4-liter model with a stainless steel bowl pumps water through a cheery plastic daisy. (It does make an audible splashing noise if the water level dips below the reservoir midpoint, but you get used to it.) The center of the flower comes out for faster water flow, or remove it altogether if your cat would rather drink from a lower, springlike burble. The inside is lit by a blue LED so you can see the water level at all times, and refills of the cotton-carbon-resin filters are easy to find and reasonable at a little over $1 each. Inexpensive fountains like this are usually hit or miss in terms of quality, but this one has been going strong in our long-term testing for over three months. —Kat Merck\nThe Petkit PuraMax 2 is my second-favorite automatic litter box. With this box, owners can monitor cats’ usage through an app, and the box cleans litter via rotation, using a grate system to separate the waste from the clean litter (when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling). This box has triple odor control, with a sealed waste bin; an odor eliminator attachment that sits in the waste bin; and a smart, citrusy deodorizing spray that goes off after every cleaning and randomly throughout the day to ensure the litter box stays fresh. Not only does this litter box smell neutral, dare I say it smells … good? At $430, this is the lowest price we’ve ever seen it. But I’d argue that never having to scoop dirty litter again is priceless. —Molly Higgins\nThis is my top pick for Cat Water Fountains because it's reliable, safe, and easy to clean with a cordless pump. The basin sits on a dock, the stainless steel bowl snaps on top of the basin for easy cleaning and refilling, and the basin holds 130 milliliters in the bowl at all times in case of power outage. The fountain also has a low-water detection system, automatically stopping if water levels get too low. The connected app records when your cat drank, how much they drank, and for how long. This is the automatic fountain I recommend to people, and at $40, this is generally the lowest we see the price drop. —Molly Higgins\nThis cat water fountain became one of my top choices because my cats were obsessed with it. This automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered, lasting up to 83 days using only the battery. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat’s drinking habits have changed, and the app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you need to refill the water. The water flow can be standard flow, intermittent (three minutes on and off), or battery (where the water flow time and sleeping mode time are fully customizable), or you can pause the water flow altogether and just use the basin reserve. —Molly Higgins\nThis fountain is super helpful for people who have pets with health issues. Using a collar tag to monitor which cat is using the device and for how long, you can compare and track health data (for up to five pets). The Petlibro app alerts you when your pet's consumption is down or up, and you can set hydration goals, which the app will let you know have been met or not. This automatic fountain is especially useful for pet parents of elderly male cats or those who have had health issues with UTIs to more easily monitor and track changes. We’ve seen the price dip lower, but at 20 bucks off, this is a good investment to make to save you costly vet bills and encourage water-drinking. —Molly Higgins\nThis circular automatic fountain connects to an app to monitor water levels and remind you when it’s time to change the filter and refill, and has a wireless pump that pushes water from the basin into the top lip, circulating continuously. The top part also has a small reservoir that keeps 60 milliliters of water in the tray at all times, ensuring your kitty always has access to water. It has a circular filter, and the pump also has a foam filter and UV light to further sterilize water by killing potentially harmful bacteria. For a little over 50 bucks, this is a solid investment in your cats’ well-being. —Molly Higgins\nI cannot tell you how much I love this automatic feeder. The built-in camera gives me so much peace of mind when I’m away. The camera also has night vision so you can watch and hear your pet 24/7, and you can even communicate with them via speaker. It's controlled via an app and dispenses food from its 5-liter capacity based on the feeding schedule you create. The app is easy to use with extremely customizable feeding plans with meals that you label individually. Now on sale for around $100, this savvy little device reliably feeds my cats daily and doubles as a security cam when I’m away. —Molly Higgins\nI deemed this automatic litter box “Best for Helicopter Parents” (8/10 WIRED Recommends) because it doubles as both a livestream of your cat’s goings-on inside the litter box and a security cam on the outside. This is the lowest price we’ve ever seen, at $200 off. Using a camera and AI technology, the litter box identifies which cat used the box (and you can view your cat’s stool to help more closely monitor their health), while the app logs and monitors usage—including the number of times used and the average duration. Although a little pricey, an automatic litter box is a game-changing investment—especially since it’s below a thousand dollars right now. —Molly Higgins\nJump to a Topic: Best Tech Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers), Best TV Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Pet Deals, Best Outdoor Deals\nBest Outdoor Deals\nAs we’ve found in almost a year of testing for our guide to the Best Smart Bird Feeders, there are no problem-free smart bird feeders (yet)—every model we’ve tested has had at least some issues, whether with connectivity, app user-friendliness, or quality of the cameras or body casing. With that in mind, this feeder has fewer issues than most, especially when considering value, features, and reliability. The AI isn’t perfect and requires a subscription and the auxiliary solar panel is finicky, but the IP65-rated plastic body makes it easy to clean, the 1080p camera is solid for the price, and it offers color night vision. Just be forewarned that it only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the included strap won’t work with most trees, so be prepared to use the bracket mount. —Kat Merck\nDespite poor AI identification performance and a middling app, I quite liked the reliability and easy setup of this Honorable Mention-earning smart bird feeder. Many of the features users expect (like the ability to take video) require a subscription to unlock, but this is one of the rare budget smart feeder cameras that offers lighted night vision, and birds really seem to like the feeder itself, whether due to its color, extended perch, or generous (2L) seed capacity. Longer-term testing also found it to hold up well to heavy and/or persistent squirrels. —Kat Merck\nThe latest hummingbird feeder from Netvue subsidiary Birdfy, maker of our favorite Smart Bird Feeder, this 20-ounce model features dual cameras (one front, one side) with impressive 2K resolution and HD video. Both camera views are shown split-screen in Birdfy’s easy-to-use app, and I quite enjoyed watching the various angles of hummingbirds who came to graze at the feeder’s trio of red plastic flowers. That is, while the feeder was working. Our test unit is now defunct due to a faulty sensor, but reviews throughout the internet indicate this was likely an anomaly. —Kat Merck\nThe Repel Umbrella is sturdy, capable of handling high winds, and has good coverage when it’s open. There’s also a single button that opens and collapses the fiberglass ribs (it collapses down to just a foot in length too). You’ll have your choice among a variety of stunning colors, too. Our only gripe is that it’s tough to close and requires two hands. Your other option is to use the ground as leverage and push the handle down. —Brenda Stolyar\nIf you’re shopping for a compact and powerful flashlight for late-night walks or emergency kits, this is a solid pick at $25. The Anker Bolder LC90 blasts 900 lumens, enough to temporarily disorient a threat, and it even has a strobe mode for extra deterrence. Unlike pepper spray or mace, there’s no risk of accidentally blinding yourself, and if the threat turns out to be a non-threat, no harm is done. It’s rechargeable, water-resistant, and small enough to toss into a tote bag. —Boutayna Chokrane\nOlight makes our favorite flashlight, the Arkfeld Pro, which is on sale for $25 off right now. But the baby of the lineup, the teeny but powerful Baton4 is the model on the biggest sale.

Amazon has spied a gap in the calendar and plans to cram it full of deals. Amazon’s Big Spring Sale kicked off on March 25 and ends today, March 31. With no other big sale events in view, this could be a good time to snag that mesh router, set of headphones, or robot vac you’ve had your eye on.

Amazon’s Eero makes some of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-mesh-wifi-routers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our favorite mesh systems</a>, ideal for busy families seeking a set-and-forget mesh. The Pro 6E is a tri-band system with a 6-GHz band for fast Wi-Fi at close range, and with the jump to Wi-Fi 7 systems still costly, this system is worth considering right now. But you need an Eero Plus subscription at $10 per month or $100 per year to unlock the best features, including parental controls, advanced security, and ad blocking.

It can juice up phones, run microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones because it can fast-charge most models. It gets a little noisy with several gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-portable-power-stations/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best portable power stations</a> guide. <em>—Simon Hill</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">This is one of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-portable-power-stations/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best portable power stations</a> for camping or road trips because it’s a manageable size. EcoFlow’s River 2 Pro has a LiFeP04 battery inside, which is good for 768 watt-hours. It has all the ports you need to charge your phones and other small gadgets, and the X-Boost surge enables it to power small appliances. You can charge it from an outlet or solar panels, though it takes more than an hour, and the fan can get a little noisy. <em>—Simon Hill</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">Built to last, this braided nylon cable’s exterior is 100 percent recycled plastic that Anker promises will last a century. It can operate in temperatures from -40 degrees to 176 degrees Fahrenheit. The ribbed cuffs make it easy to grip for plugging and unplugging, it has USB-IF certification, and it comes with a lifetime warranty. One of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-usb-c-cables/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best USB-C cables</a> for charging a wide range of gadgets, the Anker Prime can supply up to 240 watts, making it suitable for laptops, smartphones, and anything else with a USB-C port. <em>—Simon Hill</em></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">This is our favorite budget option in our <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-webcams/#61e1ff3e14ec8fbe076333eb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">guide to Best Webcams</a>.

This is the best subscription-free option in our <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-video-doorbells/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Video Doorbells</a> guide, because there’s 8 GB of built-in storage for local recording and it can connect to a HomeBase 3 hub for more. The 2K footage is crisp and clear, and there’s on-device people, package, and even face detection, though it’s not always accurate, and this doorbell can be laggy when connecting away from home. —<em>Simon Hill</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">If you don’t want to worry about batteries in your <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-video-doorbells/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">smart video doorbell</a>, the Reolink Video Doorbell is a great option that lets you wire it into your home, letting it stay powered on for years to come. Reolink has a simple app, an included chime, plus built-in speakers and a microphone. The camera displays 2K video and records to a microSD card, so you don’t need a cloud storage fee like other doorbells. <em>—Nena Farrell</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">This Qi2 power bank can wirelessly charge at up to 15 watts, but there’s also a built-in USB-C cable that can deliver up to 30 watts, and it supports several charging protocols (PD 3.0, PPS, and QC 3.0). There’s a wee kickstand to prop your iPhone in portrait or landscape orientation for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-phone-as-bedside-clock/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple's StandBy</a> feature.

It looks great with a transparent, prism-shaped design, but it’s also extremely useful with a maximum output of 170 watts and a 24,000-mAh capacity, not to mention tough, with an <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ip-ratings-explained/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IP66 rating</a> for water resistance. It will fast charge just about any small gadget, from phones to laptops, and the handy wee display shows battery life as a percentage, time remaining, and the input or output in watts. —<em>Simon Hill</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">Ugreen's charger can supply up to 145 watts (one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W), which very few power banks can do. The ample 25,000 mAh battery will keep all your gadgets topped up and is safe to fly with in your <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-carry-on-luggage/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">carry-on</a>. It’s a solid option for fast-charging phones, tablets, or even laptops (although it doesn't support Samsung's fast-charging tech). A small LED shows the current charge state of the battery, and it comes with a USB-C cable. —<em>Simon Hill</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">I hate using clip-on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-reading-lights/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reading lights</a> because I always feel like they’re too top-heavy. So, I was excited to find this one that wraps around your neck. It’s lightweight and comfortable to wear for long reading sessions—once you get past how funny it looks. It also offers three color temperature modes including yellow, warm white, and cool. You’ll also have six brightness settings to pick from that you can cycle through with a button. It offers up to 80 hours of battery life at dimmer settings too. <em>—Brenda Stolyar</em></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Simon Hill</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">I’m not entirely sold on the necessity of XR (mixed reality) or augmented reality glasses. But Viture has done the best job of finding a legitimate use for them: a portable gaming display you can take anywhere. The original Viture One XR Glasses (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/viture-one-xr-glasses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">6/10, WIRED Review</a>) were okay, but the Viture Pro boasts a slightly larger virtual screen (135 inches), a smoother <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/high-refresh-rate-explained/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">120-Hz frame rate</a>, and a far higher maximum brightness of 4,000 nits. Virtue has also done a nice job with the software, and the experience is tailored for gamers, though various accessories may be required, depending on your platform of choice. You can also use these glasses for multitasking work or watching movies, though the Harman-tuned speakers are limited. <em>—Simon Hill</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">It may be bigger than some of the other <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-travel-adapters/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best travel adapters</a>, but this versatile gadget covers most of the globe, and offers two grounded US AC outlets, a built-in USB-C cable, two USB-A ports (15 watts total), and two USB-C ports (20 watts each). There is surge protection, but this is not a voltage converter. Unfortunately, the two AC outlets are close together, so the size of some plugs can make it challenging to use both simultaneously. But with the ability to charge up to seven devices, this is worth packing in your suitcase. —<em>Simon Hill</em></p><hr class=\"paywall\"/><p class=\"paywall\"><em><strong>Jump to a Topic:</strong> <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-tech-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Tech Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-amazon-device-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Amazon Device Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-home-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Home Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-home-office-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Home Office Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-kitchen-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Kitchen Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-beauty-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Beauty Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-mobile-phone-deals-plus-accessories\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Mobile Phone Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-smartwatch-deals-plus-fitness-trackers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers)</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-tv-deals-plus-streaming-devices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best TV Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-speaker-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Speaker Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-headphone-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Headphone Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-pet-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Pet Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-outdoor-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Outdoor Deals</a></em></p><hr class=\"paywall\"/><p id=\"best-amazon-device-deals\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Best Amazon Device Deals</h2></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Adrienne So</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">When Amazon <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-new-kindle-colorsoft-kindle-paperwhite-kindle-scribe-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updated its entire Kindle lineup</a>, that did not exclude the Kindle versions for kids. My kids have tested the Kindle kids’ versions since they came out in 2019, and to my eye, the new Kindle Kids and Kindle Kids Paperwhite are both noticeably faster and clearer than the old versions.

The vibrations provide a more subtle way to wake up by forgoing the jarring alarm sounds, and the escalating pattern of the buzzing helps ease the snoozer into wakefulness. The vibrations, along with the noise and adjustable intensity, helped me wake up more easily than other buzzing alarms I’ve tried, and at $18, it’s one of the lowest prices we’ve seen for it this year. <em>—Molly Higgins</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">Tushy makes some of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-bidets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best budget electric bidets</a>, and the Classic 3.0 is a great choice for any bathroom—renters included—since it’s a small accessory that doesn’t require any additional power and can be added to just about any toilet. For having no electricity added, it’s got impressive water power and a nice range of finishes so you can select the one that best matches your bathroom’s vibe. <em>—Nena Farrell</em></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Adrienne So</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">The Dyson V15s Detect Submarine is one of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-dyson-vacuums/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our favorite Dyson vacuums</a> overall. It’s got a wet roller head and drip tray built in, which makes it both a vacuum and a mop. It can clean about 1,000 square feet on one charge and water tank fill, with up to an hour of run time and around 4.5 hours to recharge the battery. If you want a wet/dry vacuum that isn’t a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-robot-vacuums/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">robot</a>, this is a great deal on Dyson’s offering. <em>—Louryn Strampe</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">True Classic’s white tee is snug in the right places, and relaxed everywhere else. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-fitting-t-shirts-men/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Editor Jeremy White appreciates</a> the “dad bod” fit and says the neckline is just right. WIRED UK managing editor Mike Dent admits he’d probably wear it to death as pajamas. It is a 60/40 cotton-poly bend, meaning it’s not the most sustainable choice and is more likely to pill. Still, at $25, it’s a solid tee that won’t make you look like an extra in an early aughts music video. <em>—Boutayna Chokrane</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">I recently wrote an article about <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/comfort-colors-t-shirts-are-the-best/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">how much I love Comfort Colors t-shirts</a>, which are slowly displacing every other t-shirt in my closet.

This is why I’d always recommend waiting for a good sale before buying one. Luckily, this is a doozy, knocking $200 off the list price on one of our favorite portable heaters and fans. This model is basically an all-things-to-all people air-changing doohickey par excellence. The HP07 is a space heater with an energy-saving, accurate thermostat that’ll also work as a fan, an air quality monitor, and an air purifying filter.

The company offers a broad array of robot vacuum/mops at a wide range of prices. This one is the midrange model, and I did find that it navigated better than the cheaper versions. There are a few other standout features besides the very good price—the clean/dirty water tanks are absolutely ginormous, so you can go much longer without refilling them, and it has an extendable arm to get in all the little nooks and crannies. <em>—Adrienne So</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">Tineco makes some great floor cleaning gadgets—I was vacuuming my entire house with the <a class=\"external-link\" data-aps-asc-tag=\"w050b-20\" data-aps-asin=\"B0D8J2RPV9\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/FQtSsbCs7qxyX6GEHMbPJtVGtJZebTaY47scu66bDWhuGLDh8er1UekufYQ7ty9KWMWWVhbiCTH2E9citXTeuVtxDGfijT3Yy6YBaqTwh3VLxRhXWHuXYpGvfHpM2pGApvaK93ygVPSVJTmxa5hEMAb6tgyFJkmmsr6Xp19HGGyXBNWgTLdWkTUqV8EFmpuJ2fjKJ3p7rtsBzcgy7zf9QfGvnuMdz1em8BC54FQHoZNwLj223QGmzrzYX4NnmmpknTUWnwHUG4sKfR9c4R1VWax1UDL1wATnvMv9MCC6C68cADpiDkrPVhUATp3DUUJV9szjns6dREFRWzbqzrRWD4mhvgRjvfEGUdVyJJfV5FKj6FT13Bb89WShkR1A4tpTNK5WhNPq1prgtLRrk5S2G42zNAL\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tineco-Station-Full-Path-Self-Cleaning-ZeroTangle/dp/B0D8J2RPV9/ref=asc_df_B0D8J2RPV9?\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/FQtSsbCs7qxyX6GEHMbPJtVGtJZebTaY47scu66bDWhuGLDh8er1UekufYQ7ty9KWMWWVhbiCTH2E9citXTeuVtxDGfijT3Yy6YBaqTwh3VLxRhXWHuXYpGvfHpM2pGApvaK93ygVPSVJTmxa5hEMAb6tgyFJkmmsr6Xp19HGGyXBNWgTLdWkTUqV8EFmpuJ2fjKJ3p7rtsBzcgy7zf9QfGvnuMdz1em8BC54FQHoZNwLj223QGmzrzYX4NnmmpknTUWnwHUG4sKfR9c4R1VWax1UDL1wATnvMv9MCC6C68cADpiDkrPVhUATp3DUUJV9szjns6dREFRWzbqzrRWD4mhvgRjvfEGUdVyJJfV5FKj6FT13Bb89WShkR1A4tpTNK5WhNPq1prgtLRrk5S2G42zNAL\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pure One Station 5</a> before writing this—including a fantastic carpet cleaner.

The first is its broad, flat showerhead that offers a lovely, even, spalike spray. The second is that unlike most of the showerheads I tested, Afina works quite well for the entire duration of its filter life. In part, this is because they recommend filter replacement every two months instead of every three months, at $30 a pop.

It dried apple slices, kiwis, and banana chips in half the time of a typical dehydrator cycle, as viewable through the machine’s large glass window.

It’s got all the same bells and whistles as higher-end models, including 17 preset programs, a delay timer, and a fruit-and-nut dispenser, and it can turn out loaves in three different sizes, as opposed to the usual one or two. Its ceramic pan is free of nonstick coatings and potential PFOAs and can be run through the dishwasher for easy cleaning. The recipe book leaves something to be desired in terms of variety and readability (and quality of the recipes in general—I recommend looking elsewhere online; some KBS-owning Redditors have had success with <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes\" href=\"https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">King Arthur recipes</a>).

Astonishingly, its claims of heating to 800 degrees Fahrenheit on the top and bottom heating element are accurate and it takes about 15 minutes!

The outer shell that covers the hot teeth is safer than a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-hair-straighteners/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">traditional flat iron</a> and enables users to get closer to their roots than they would otherwise, which is great for tamping down flyaways. The brush is also reasonably lightweight at under 1 pound, in case you’d want to use it for travel. Also note that it comes with a black-and-pink heat-resistant glove, which apparently is to use on your hair and not actually on the tool, as former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano found out the hard way. <em>—Kat Merck</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">This is the original “upgrade” hair straightener that changed the flat iron game for many (including myself) when it was released in 2006, and it’s still going strong today.

It only heats to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, but it does so in seconds and requires minimal passes. Woollaston-Webber says the outer plastic does get hot while styling, so it may not be the best pick for younger users, but if that doesn’t bother you this is still the best deal on a solid hair straightener you’ll find for $50. <em>—Kat Merck</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">The Aquasonic Black Series is not for the weak-gummed.

You get a pressure sensor that reduces vibrations when you’re brushing too hard, a two-minute timer, and two intensity settings (low and high). A single charge lasts about two weeks, and it’s designed with BrushSync technology that tracks how long (and hard) you’ve been brushing and will remind you when it’s time to replace the head. Normally $50—now $40—<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-electric-toothbrushes/#6501f87712839787bfbd8fd6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this is the best midrange electric toothbrush we’ve tested</a>. <em>—Boutayna Chokrane</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">If you’re still scraping your tongue with <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-electric-toothbrushes/#6501f87712839787bfbd8fd6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">your toothbrush</a>, it’s time for MasterMedi Tongue Scraper. This stainless steel scraper is way more effective, easier to clean, and won’t snap in half like plastic versions. This two-pack comes with individual cases (one for home, one for your travel kit).

It measures nearly 8 inches across, and it’s easy to transport in a backpack or weekender. Unfurl the flat disc to reveal a mirror that can be used compact-style or raised on a stand and angled in all sorts of directions. The ring light around the mirror is bright, but it doesn’t take up too much of the reflective surface, and there are three light temperature settings to choose from. The interface is simple, and the mirror stays closed reliably. It also recharges quickly via USB-C, and the battery lasts about 10 hours on one charge. If you’re frequently applying your makeup on the go, or you’re sick of terrible hotel bathroom lighting ruining your glam, this price is too good to pass up (in my personal and very experienced opinion). —<em>Louryn Strampe</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">The Fancii Taylor is the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-lighted-makeup-mirrors/#675c902b431f021752de0e36\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best lighted makeup mirror</a> out there. The compact-style mirror measures 5 inches across—so it’s bigger than traditional compacts and better suited for a larger purse than a pocket. One side has 1x magnification and the other side has 10x magnification, so you’ll be able to see up close even if you’re doing your makeup on the go. There are three lighting temperatures to choose from and the battery lasts for about a month before needing to be topped off via USB-C (which takes about an hour). —<em>Louryn Strampe</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">If TikTok’s raving about it, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/i-have-beef-with-tallow/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">I’m skeptical</a>, but experts back this trend up. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/snail-mucin-skincare-sensation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Snail mucin</a> is packed with glycoproteins and hyaluronic acid—but don’t expect overnight miracles.

The material attracts water, which helps flatten zits and suck out all the gross stuff inside them. It’s weirdly satisfying to use them, and it’s also empowering, transforming a blemish into an accessory. Pimple patches are usually affordable. The reason I personally like and use Starface patches is because they come in a cute storage case with a little mirror, which helps when I feel hormonal acne cropping up while I’m out and about. <a class=\"external-link\" data-aps-asc-tag=\"w050b-20\" data-aps-asin=\"B0BHF7GKQ6\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3z2cX3BbZjFAzMv3qE58qM6T2uDM93sNHGGtahc5nYMDrhD7z2Lqq6RNduo5a2DM3WeLi4VPJW6ZUXTNe6YLEMpyhDgTtmArmZMdy9LqMGyRXXNYUmjiFtv6oWSv89pnVMiB9Pn4E6c9H1pF4ANLAXH4LAXjubEUV27wHnXM6xbMdsRDCA2p4MhGoRseNe9zTfrPW7szXNsRXY6j5ck6A2YS8MoZy7ms4LvRdU21V7GXU8dpfzg1oeGbHZLS9t5V5p6mTn31ASABseUjUUtbP8issfeW2hWN36WjF3b3rz1aREVaSVTneCNnfGzfULaQ9SJU3rcrqyjaxR62BaTJzy3zbvg1jNDJPRdB8Tog42wigV4bywQww7DqHzcc45VVaAvn3vqp2M6\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Starface-Hydro-Stars-Hydrocolloid-Inflammation-Cruelty-Free/dp/B0BHF7GKQ6/\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3z2cX3BbZjFAzMv3qE58qM6T2uDM93sNHGGtahc5nYMDrhD7z2Lqq6RNduo5a2DM3WeLi4VPJW6ZUXTNe6YLEMpyhDgTtmArmZMdy9LqMGyRXXNYUmjiFtv6oWSv89pnVMiB9Pn4E6c9H1pF4ANLAXH4LAXjubEUV27wHnXM6xbMdsRDCA2p4MhGoRseNe9zTfrPW7szXNsRXY6j5ck6A2YS8MoZy7ms4LvRdU21V7GXU8dpfzg1oeGbHZLS9t5V5p6mTn31ASABseUjUUtbP8issfeW2hWN36WjF3b3rz1aREVaSVTneCNnfGzfULaQ9SJU3rcrqyjaxR62BaTJzy3zbvg1jNDJPRdB8Tog42wigV4bywQww7DqHzcc45VVaAvn3vqp2M6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Refills</a> are affordable, too. —<em>Louryn Strampe</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">Micellar water is a godsend for those people who are sometimes too lazy to fully wash their faces at night.

You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription.

The latest Pill (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/beats-pill-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">8/10, WIRED Recommends</a>) offers a posh design, great sound, and loads of features, from solid water resistance to a USB-C input for lossless audio playback. Its zippy sound signature goes heavy on the bass and treble but both are presented with care and musicality, and its mix of keen instrumental textures and stereo separation place it among the top performers in its class. The Pill’s stylish frame isn’t as drop-friendly as rivals from JBL or UE, but at $100 this is an easy decision for anyone eyeing a solid Bluetooth buddy. <em>—Ryan Waniata</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">These perfectly sized speakers will bring a rich, clear sound to your desktop. They come in black or white with angled stands to fire the audio into your ears. Our current pick of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-computer-speakers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best computer speakers</a> under $200, the M60 speakers are already a bargain, so this discount makes them irresistible for anyone in the market. While they offer decent bass, it can get a bit muddy, and the touch controls are slightly annoying, but that’s it for weaknesses. Connectivity choices include USB-C (which will be best for most folks), 3.5 mm, or Bluetooth 5.3. <em>—Simon Hill</em></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Waniata</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">The Everboom is a solid offering from Ultimate Ears, one of our favorite Bluetooth speaker makers. The only real issue I took with the speaker in my <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/ultimate-ears-everboom/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Everboom review</a> is that its sound quality and features are remarkably similar to the Megaboom 4, which costs $50 less. Issue resolved! If you’re looking for a powerful and uniquely designed Bluetooth speaker with loads of extras to pump up your outdoor jams, at $200 or less the Everboom is a solid choice. <em>—Ryan Waniata</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">This isn’t a sale so much as the new regular price, but anytime you can get this speaker at $60 or less it’s well worth considering. I like its smooth and warm sound that pays good attention to detail. I love its ultra-portable design that easily clips to shower attachments, branches, belt loops, etc. The Clip is durable and its IP67 dust and water resistance means it works easily as well as a shower speaker or chilling at the beach. <em>—Ryan Waniata</em></p><hr class=\"paywall\"/><p class=\"paywall\"><em><strong>Jump to a Topic:</strong> <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-tech-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Tech Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-amazon-device-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Amazon Device Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-home-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Home Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-home-office-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Home Office Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-kitchen-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Kitchen Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-beauty-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Beauty Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-mobile-phone-deals-plus-accessories\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Mobile Phone Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-smartwatch-deals-plus-fitness-trackers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers)</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-tv-deals-plus-streaming-devices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best TV Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-speaker-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Speaker Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-headphone-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Headphone Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-pet-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Pet Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-outdoor-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Outdoor Deals</a></em></p><hr class=\"paywall\"/><p id=\"best-headphone-deals\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Best Headphone Deals</h2></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Parker Hall</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">These cheap buds from Nothing are some of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-headphones-under-100/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">our favorite earbuds under $100</a>.

They quick-pair to all Android devices, and they have a super comfortable and stable design that will keep them in your ears even during the most strenuous workouts. I also like the charging case, which is a cute little egg that slides easily into pockets and bags. <em>—Parker Hall</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">Soundcore’s Liberty 4 NC (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">8/10, WIRED Recommends</a>) aren’t just another AirPods clone. They’re another <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/airpods-pro-2023-usb-c/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>AirPods</em> <em>Pro</em></a> clone, and a good one at that, offering excellent battery life, clear and detailed sound, and tons of customization options at a fraction of what you’ll pay for Apple’s best buds. You’re not getting Apple’s exclusive features, of course, but if you want a great experience with stem-style buds for less, this is one of my favorite pairs. The customization in Soundcore’s app alone is nearly worth the entry fee, and the buds themselves are well-built and comfy. I had a few problems with the touch controls, but otherwise it’s hard to criticize buds that rise above their price point in nearly every way that counts. <em>—Ryan Waniata</em></p><p aria-level=\"4\" class=\"paywall heading-h4\" role=\"heading\"></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\">Sony WH-1000MX5</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Sony</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">We see this discount frequently, but we’d be remiss not to include it here since it’s the best deal we see for the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-wireless-headphones/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best headphones</a> we’ve tried.

The Space A40 (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/anker-soundcore-space-a40/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">8/10, WIRED Recommends</a>) noise-canceling buds are longtime favorites for their mix of clear and full sound, solid mid-tier noise cancelation, and plenty of features rolled into a comfy design. The biggest argument against these buds is their lack of auto-pause, which means you’ll need to stay on your toes when you pull a bud out during your favorite true crime podcast. Otherwise, it’s hard to argue against their value, especially since their price has sunk like a stone to nearly half their original MSRP. <em>—Ryan Waniata</em></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">A sale on the Life Q30 is really just doubling down on value. Even at full price, these rank among the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-noise-canceling-headphones/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best noise-canceling headphones</a> I’ve tested for the money. Along with solid noise canceling, highlights include a comfy design, a great companion app, and up to 40 hours of playtime. I’ve taken these headphones on a cross-country flight and had no trouble enjoying my favorite music and movies thanks to their ability to quell engine drone and background noise. The soft plastic tends to scratch easily and they don’t have all the features of top models like the Bose QC Ultra (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">9/10, WIRED Recommends</a>) or Sony XM5 (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/review-sony-wh-1000xm5/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">9/10, WIRED Recommends</a>), but at a fraction of the cost, they’re a guilt-free budget buy. <em>—Ryan Waniata</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">This is a less exciting deal now that the new <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/beats-powerbeats-pro-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2</a> have come out.

This is an older model from 2022 (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/shokz-openrun-pro-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">8/10, WIRED Recommends</a>), but it still works great for most folks, especially at this discounted price. <em>—Parker Hall</em></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Waniata</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Bose isn’t in the business of making the second-best noise-canceling headphones. When it comes to crushing your sonic annoyances to a pulp, nobody beats the QC Ultra (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/bose-quietcomfort-ultra/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">9/10, WIRED Recommends</a>). These headphones offer rich and clear sound, plush comfort in a posh design, and the best noise canceling you can get for your money. Whether transforming traffic to a whisper or dialing back irksome vocal chatter and even barking dogs, the QC Ultra are the best we’ve tested with a price tag to match. They even offer extras like a transparency mode limiter to keep loud noises from hurting your ears. This is one of the better QC Ultra sales we’ve seen, so if you’re ready to enjoy the silence Depeche Mode style, now’s a good time. <em>—Ryan Waniata</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">The Studio Buds Plus were among the first earbuds to show Beats had truly turned the corner on a new audio era. They’re not the best noise-canceling buds around but they’ve got a cool look, solid performance, and a handy swath of features for both Android and Apple phones. Maybe most notable is their dial design which makes the buds incredibly easy to insert and control, both real-life conveniences that often get overlooked by reviewers and buyers alike. I wouldn’t suggest you buy the Studio Plus at full price these days, but they’re usually on sale well below their retail cost and right now they're particularly tempting. <em>—Ryan Waniata</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">This is one of my favorite <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-apple-airpods-cases/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AirPods cases</a>, specifically because it comes with magnets that support MagSafe accessories. Of course, it’s protective too, with a shock-absorbing hard shell along with top and bottom pieces that shut via magnets (which helps keep the lid from accidentally sliding off).

The inside is lit by a blue LED so you can see the water level at all times, and refills of the cotton-carbon-resin filters are easy to find and reasonable at <a class=\"external-link\" data-aps-asc-tag=\"w050b-20\" data-aps-asin=\"B07MBC5LQ4\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3j63gbMkR4nGMuSRMwguPdV3kwEyuAFfzkGMagPn5Tp6UyGxDx76MQCy9Hs5g9at2xDeuSEdi4WemNKtUKS5u5ZTKM9RSZxf1mLYUJkoqeuPxUVBEhp9HPmaL7miYmUhxw8MYJgEytyM9pRNiS3W3ZygKBPVoCgu3kDhS32obruCXgAFUk4NH8g58B8FnCCub5U5n6iRhAFRxhMHrmhrvoMNeCzYHFpSZtD3nXG9uWhQ9AHTenesiKLFvTSj9Puwnd9ALfPDPrTqiy56quKkjMZbCpPjSettaiEDBY3hMCrk4JsJvemnWBXTZEUYyaiELRnVKMtRtP5yCtqfqTine3breFGNo8ZNkjT15S8BtpCmHbtQKi3csGKkApBr\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wonder-Creature-Stainless-Fountain-Activated/dp/B07MBC5LQ4?th=1\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/3j63gbMkR4nGMuSRMwguPdV3kwEyuAFfzkGMagPn5Tp6UyGxDx76MQCy9Hs5g9at2xDeuSEdi4WemNKtUKS5u5ZTKM9RSZxf1mLYUJkoqeuPxUVBEhp9HPmaL7miYmUhxw8MYJgEytyM9pRNiS3W3ZygKBPVoCgu3kDhS32obruCXgAFUk4NH8g58B8FnCCub5U5n6iRhAFRxhMHrmhrvoMNeCzYHFpSZtD3nXG9uWhQ9AHTenesiKLFvTSj9Puwnd9ALfPDPrTqiy56quKkjMZbCpPjSettaiEDBY3hMCrk4JsJvemnWBXTZEUYyaiELRnVKMtRtP5yCtqfqTine3breFGNo8ZNkjT15S8BtpCmHbtQKi3csGKkApBr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a little over $1 each.</a> Inexpensive fountains like this are usually hit or miss in terms of quality, but this one has been going strong in our long-term testing for over three months. <em>—Kat Merck</em></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Molly Higgins</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">The Petkit PuraMax 2 is my second-favorite <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-automatic-cat-litter-boxes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">automatic litter box</a>. With this box, owners can monitor cats’ usage through an app, and the box cleans litter via rotation, using a grate system to separate the waste from the clean litter (when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling). This box has triple odor control, with a sealed waste bin; an odor eliminator attachment that sits in the waste bin; and a smart, citrusy deodorizing spray that goes off after every cleaning and randomly throughout the day to ensure the litter box stays fresh. Not only does this litter box smell neutral, dare I say it smells … good? At $430, this is the lowest price we’ve ever seen it. But I’d argue that never having to scoop dirty litter again is priceless. <em>—Molly Higgins</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">This is my top pick for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-cat-water-fountains\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cat Water Fountains</a> because it's reliable, safe, and easy to clean with a cordless pump. The basin sits on a dock, the stainless steel bowl snaps on top of the basin for easy cleaning and refilling, and the basin holds 130 milliliters in the bowl at all times in case of power outage. The fountain also has a low-water detection system, automatically stopping if water levels get too low. The connected app records when your cat drank, how much they drank, and for how long. This is the automatic fountain I recommend to people, and at $40, this is generally the lowest we see the price drop. <em>—Molly Higgins</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">This <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-cat-water-fountains\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cat water fountain</a> became one of my top choices because my cats were obsessed with it. This automatic fountain can be either cordless or battery-powered, lasting up to 83 days using only the battery. The app logs every time a pet drinks and compares it over time to determine whether your cat’s drinking habits have changed, and the app also keeps track of when the filter needs replacing and when you need to refill the water. The water flow can be standard flow, intermittent (three minutes on and off), or battery (where the water flow time and sleeping mode time are fully customizable), or you can pause the water flow altogether and just use the basin reserve. <em>—Molly Higgins</em></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Molly Higgins</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">This fountain is super helpful for people who have pets with health issues. Using a collar tag to monitor which cat is using the device and for how long, you can compare and track health data (for up to five pets). The Petlibro app alerts you when your pet's consumption is down or up, and you can set hydration goals, which the app will let you know have been met or not. This <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-cat-water-fountains\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">automatic fountain</a> is especially useful for pet parents of elderly male cats or those who have had health issues with UTIs to more easily monitor and track changes. We’ve seen the price dip lower, but at 20 bucks off, this is a good investment to make to save you costly vet bills and encourage water-drinking. <em>—Molly Higgins</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">This circular <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-cat-water-fountains\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">automatic fountain</a> connects to an app to monitor water levels and remind you when it’s time to change the filter and refill, and has a wireless pump that pushes water from the basin into the top lip, circulating continuously. The top part also has a small reservoir that keeps 60 milliliters of water in the tray at all times, ensuring your kitty always has access to water. It has a circular filter, and the pump also has a foam filter and UV light to further sterilize water by killing potentially harmful bacteria. For a little over 50 bucks, this is a solid investment in your cats’ well-being. <em>—Molly Higgins</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">I cannot tell you how much I love this <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-automatic-cat-feeders\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">automatic feeder</a>. The built-in camera gives me so much peace of mind when I’m away. The camera also has night vision so you can watch and hear your pet 24/7, and you can even communicate with them via speaker. It's controlled via an app and dispenses food from its 5-liter capacity based on the feeding schedule you create. The app is easy to use with extremely customizable feeding plans with meals that you label individually. Now on sale for around $100, this savvy little device reliably feeds my cats daily and doubles as a security cam when I’m away. <em>—Molly Higgins</em></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Molly Higgins</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">I deemed this <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-automatic-cat-litter-boxes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">automatic litter box</a> “Best for Helicopter Parents” (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/petkit-purobot-ultra-automatic-cat-litter-box/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">8/10 WIRED Recommends</a>) because it doubles as both a livestream of your cat’s goings-on inside the litter box and a security cam on the outside. This is the lowest price we’ve ever seen, at $200 off. Using a camera and AI technology, the litter box identifies which cat used the box (and you can view your cat’s stool to help more closely monitor their health), while the app logs and monitors usage—including the number of times used and the average duration. Although a little pricey, an automatic litter box is a game-changing investment—especially since it’s below a thousand dollars right now. <em>—Molly Higgins</em></p><hr class=\"paywall\"/><p class=\"paywall\"><em><strong>Jump to a Topic:</strong> <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-tech-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Tech Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-amazon-device-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Amazon Device Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-home-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Home Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-home-office-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Home Office Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-kitchen-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Kitchen Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-beauty-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Beauty Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-mobile-phone-deals-plus-accessories\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Mobile Phone Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-smartwatch-deals-plus-fitness-trackers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Smartwatch Deals (Plus Fitness Trackers)</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-tv-deals-plus-streaming-devices\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best TV Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-speaker-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Speaker Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-headphone-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Headphone Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-pet-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Pet Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://wired.com/story/amazon-spring-sale-2025-4#best-outdoor-deals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Outdoor Deals</a></em></p><hr class=\"paywall\"/><p id=\"best-outdoor-deals\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Best Outdoor Deals</h2></p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Courtesy of Birdfy</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">As we’ve found in almost a year of testing for our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-smart-bird-feeders/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Best Smart Bird Feeders</a>, there are no problem-free smart bird feeders (yet)—every model we’ve tested has had at least some issues, whether with connectivity, app user-friendliness, or quality of the cameras or body casing. With that in mind, this feeder has fewer issues than most, especially when considering value, features, and reliability. The AI isn’t perfect and requires a subscription and the auxiliary solar panel is finicky, but the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ip-ratings-explained/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IP65</a>-rated plastic body makes it easy to clean, the 1080p camera is solid for the price, and it offers color night vision. Just be forewarned that it only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and the included strap won’t work with most trees, so be prepared to use the bracket mount. <em>—Kat Merck</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">Despite poor AI identification performance and a middling app, I quite liked the reliability and easy setup of this <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-smart-bird-feeders/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Honorable Mention</a>-earning smart bird feeder. Many of the features users expect (like the ability to take video) require a subscription to unlock, but this is one of the rare budget smart feeder cameras that offers lighted night vision, and birds really seem to like the feeder itself, whether due to its color, extended perch, or generous (2L) seed capacity. Longer-term testing also found it to hold up well to heavy and/or persistent squirrels. <em>—Kat Merck</em></p><p class=\"paywall\">The latest hummingbird feeder from Netvue subsidiary Birdfy, maker of our favorite <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-smart-bird-feeders/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Bird Feeder</a>, this 20-ounce model features dual cameras (one front, one side) with impressive 2K resolution and HD video. Both camera views are shown split-screen in Birdfy’s easy-to-use app, and I quite enjoyed watching the various angles of hummingbirds who came to graze at the feeder’s trio of red plastic flowers. That is, while the feeder was working.

    "content_text": "Amazon is still seen as a bit of a laggard in the race to develop advanced artificial intelligence, but it has quietly created a lab that is now setting records when it comes to AI performance. Amazon’s AGI SF Lab, which is located in San Francisco and dedicated to building artificial general intelligence, or AI that surpasses the capabilities of humans, revealed the first fruits of its work today: A new AI model capable of powering some of the most advanced AI agents available anywhere.\nThe new model, called Amazon Nova Act, outperforms ones from OpenAI and Anthropic on several benchmarks designed to gauge the intelligence and aptitude of AI agents, Amazon says. On the benchmarks GroundUI Web and ScreenSpot, Amazon Nova Act performs better than Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI Computer Use Agent. A major part of Amazon’s plan to compete in the AI market is to focus on building agents, and the new model’s abilities reflect its efforts to build a generation of tools that can measure up to the very best available.\n“I believe that the basic atomic unit of computing in the future is going to be a call to a giant [AI] agent,” says David Luan, who leads Amazon’s AGI SF Lab. He was previously a vice president of engineering at OpenAI and later cofounded Adept, a startup that pioneered work on AI agents, before joining Amazon in 2024.\nMost of the leading AI labs are now focused on building increasingly capable AI agents. Getting AI to master independent actions, as well as conversation, promises to make the technology more useful and valuable. The shift from chat to action is still very much a work in progress, however.\nIn the past six months, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others have demonstrated web-browsing agents that take actions in response to a prompt. But for the most part, these agents are still unreliable, and they can easily be tripped up by open-ended requests.\nLuan says that Amazon’s goal is building AI agents that are dependable rather than flashy. The thing holding agents back is not the need for “more cool demos of interesting capabilities that work 60 percent of the time, it’s the Waymo problem,” he says, referring to how self-driving cars needed to be trained to deal with unusual edge cases before they could take to the streets unsupervised.\nMany so-called agents are built by combining large language models with multiple human-written rules that are designed to prevent them from veering off course, but also makes their behavior brittle. Amazon Nova Act is a version of the company's most powerful homegrown model Amazon Nova that has received additional training to help it make decisions about what actions to take and at what time. In general, Luan says, AI models struggle to decide when they should intervene in a task.\nTo improve Nova’s agential abilities, Amazon is using reinforcement learning, a method that has helped other AI models better simulate reasoning.\nAmazon is also taking inspiration from physical robots with its new models. Luan’s team is working with another group at Amazon based in San Francisco led by Pieter Abbeel, a professor at UC Berkeley who works on finding AI applications for robotics. Abbeel, a fellow early OpenAI employee, joined Amazon in August 2024 after it invested in his startup, Covariant. Amazon is well positioned to make progress in robotics given the vast numbers of those already deployed in its fulfillment centers.\nThe release of Amazon Nova Act suggests that Amazon could emerge as a dark horse in the race to create useful software agents. The company was slow in responding to ChatGPT, but it has more recently shown signs of getting its act together. In February, the company announced a new version of its voice assistant Alexa with improved conversational abilities as well as the capacity to automate certain web tasks.\nOne use case Amazon cited is Alexa helping to book a repair service for a broken oven. Luan says Alexa’s new agentic capabilities were developed by his team.\nAs WIRED revealed in October, Amazon has also done research on how agents might eventually improve ecommerce by automating the process of finding and buying things. Such an agent might preemptively add items to a user’s cart based on their interests and habits, Amazon’s engineers said.\nBesides unveiling the new model, Amazon today announced a software development kit (SDK) designed to make it easier for computer engineers to use Amazon Nova Act to build software agents. The SDK lets developers give their agent specific instructions to help them navigate an internet built for human users. For example, an agent can be instructed “don’t accept the insurance upsell” when booking a rental car.\nUltimately, Luan says, Amazon’s agents should become smart enough not to fall for the upsell on their own. “Nova Act is really like the very first step in that vision,” he says.\nUpdate 3/31/25 12 pm EST: This story has been updated to clarify that Amazon did not take a stake in Adept.",

On the benchmarks GroundUI Web and ScreenSpot, Amazon Nova Act performs better than Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI Computer Use Agent. A major part of Amazon’s plan to compete in the AI market is to focus on building agents, and the new model’s abilities reflect its efforts to build a generation of tools that can measure up to the very best available.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“I believe that the basic atomic unit of computing in the future is going to be a call to a giant [AI] agent,” says David Luan, who leads Amazon’s AGI SF Lab. He was previously a vice president of engineering at OpenAI and later cofounded Adept, a startup that pioneered work on AI agents, before joining Amazon in 2024.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Most of the leading AI labs are now focused on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-forget-chatbots-ai-agents-are-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">building increasingly capable AI agents</a>. Getting AI to master independent actions, as well as conversation, promises to make the technology more useful and valuable. The shift from chat to action is still very much a work in progress, however.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">In the past six months, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others have demonstrated <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-forget-chatbots-ai-agents-are-the-future/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">web-browsing agents</a> that take actions in response to a prompt. But for the most part, these agents are still unreliable, and they can easily be tripped up by open-ended requests.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Luan says that Amazon’s goal is building AI agents that are dependable rather than flashy. The thing holding agents back is not the need for “more cool demos of interesting capabilities that work 60 percent of the time, it’s the Waymo problem,” he says, referring to how self-driving cars needed to be trained to deal with unusual edge cases before they could take to the streets unsupervised.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Many so-called agents are built by combining large language models with multiple human-written rules that are designed to prevent them from veering off course, but also makes their behavior brittle. Amazon Nova Act is a version of the company's most powerful homegrown model <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/\" href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Nova</a> that has received additional training to help it make decisions about what actions to take and at what time. In general, Luan says, AI models struggle to decide when they should intervene in a task.</p><p class=\"paywall\">To improve Nova’s agential abilities, Amazon is using <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/pioneers-of-reward-based-machine-learning-win-turing-award/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reinforcement learning</a>, a method that has helped other <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-world-first-hybrid-reasoning-ai-model/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AI models better simulate reasoning</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "OpenAI isn’t slowing down when it comes to building extra functions and add-ons into its ChatGPT AI bot, and one of the newest features to roll out—exclusive to paying users, for now—is ChatGPT Projects.\nThis is a major step forward for keeping conversations and data organized in ChatGPT: It gives you the ability to put your discussions with ChatGPT in separate spaces, like folders in a filing cabinet, complete with uploaded documents, web searches, custom instructions, and whatever else you've added.\nYou can have one project for researching birthday present ideas, for example, and one for analyzing the current state of the movie industry. (Bear in mind, as always, that generative AI can get things wrong.) It's up to you how you use them, but Projects can make a genuine difference to workflows in ChatGPT.\nGet Started With ChatGPT Projects\nThe instructions here are for the ChatGPT web app, though projects are also available through the navigation pane in the ChatGPT mobile app too. Click New project in the navigation pane on the left. (If you can't see the navigation pane, click the icon in the very top-left corner to reveal it.) If you already have projects in place, click the + (plus) icon to create a new one.\nStraightaway you'll be prompted to give your project a name to identify it. Note that existing chats can be moved in and out of projects, and between them, if needed—just click on the three dots next to a chat in the navigation pane to find these options. It means you can decide to start some conversations first, then move them into a project later, rather than starting with the project.\nOnce ChatGPT puts you in your clean, new project, you get several options onscreen: You can start a new chat, Add files to the project, or Add instructions. Any files or instructions you add (such as \"respond to me as if I'm a novice in this subject\") will be carried over across all the project chats, saving you from having to repeat yourself or keep on uploading the same files each time.\nAnd that's just about all there is to getting started with ChatGPT Projects. There are no real options to speak of for individual projects, but if you click the three dots in the top-right corner of any project’s front page, you can rename it or delete it. (Deleting it will also delete all the conversations inside it.) Your projects and chats stack up on the left of the screen as you create them, with individual conversations nested inside projects.\nThere are a few limitations to bear in mind: You don't get the option to add files from Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive in projects, like you can in normal ChatGPT conversations, and projects can't be shared with other users (at least for now).\nHow to Make Use of ChatGPT Projects\nThere aren't really right or wrong ways to use ChatGPT Projects. Just like labels in Gmail, it's up to you how you make use of the feature. You could build a project to help you complete a novel or to plan a switch in career or to store a collection of strategies for mindfulness and meditation.\nSay you're planning a weekend away with the kids. You can use the instructions part of the project to explain where and when you're going and how old your kids are, to save you having to repeat this each time. As far as files go, you could upload any existing plans you've made or any information you've got about your destination, which ChatGPT can use alongside its own training data and web searches.\nOr maybe you want to use a project to create a finely tuned music recommendation engine. You can type in your preferences and tastes in the instructions part of the project, then upload files cataloging all the music you've listened to. (Yes, we know you're out there.) Each individual chat could then dive deep for playlist recommendations based on a theme or artist.\nYou can make changes to the files you've uploaded and the instructions you've given at any time, though these modifications won't retroactively affect any of the conversations you've already had with ChatGPT. Every time you submit a prompt, the AI bot will use the information available at that time.\nIf needed, you can attach specific files for specific chats inside projects using the paperclip icon—and you can access other tools (such as the image generator) by clicking the toolbox icon underneath the text prompt box. This gives you access to the ChatGPT Canvas interface, which is more similar to Google Docs than Google Chat.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\n“OK, so you have to say it with a smile, no matter what you’re saying, because the shape of your mouth makes a difference.” Kristen DiMercurio is teaching me how to sound like my Bluetooth speaker.\n“The resonance is in your chest and throat, it’s very deep, very low. You have to enunciate every consonant. I do a slight amount of airiness. I’m practically singing it, it’s very melodic. And there’s a certain rhythm: It usually goes up and then down at the end. You get that unnatural, clipped sound. I’ve never really broken it down like this … Bluetooth connected.”\nAnd there it is. Something you’ve probably heard hundreds or thousands of times, and maybe never thought about once. DiMercurio, a voice-over actor, onscreen actor, singer, and podcaster, first went viral on TikTok last September when she revealed that she is the voice of many, many, many Bluetooth speakers, gadgets, and smart-home devices. Suddenly, she had 17 million views on one post, more than 700,000 followers, and her mentions were full of comments like “OMG did you do the Duolingo Premium voice?” and “Low battery, please recharge.”\nDiMercurio—or the Bluetooth Lady as she has nicknamed herself—began taking voice-over jobs as a way to pay her New York City rent while auditioning for Broadway roles and bartending in the mid 2010s. “It took about six months before it was not my side hustle anymore, and I was recording full time,” she says. DiMercurio signed up to five or six online voice-over platforms and marketplaces, including Voices.com, Voices123, Voice Bunny, Fiverr, and Indeed. She recorded a whole bunch of backend workplace training videos (“Click next to continue”), phone tree systems (“That always gives me a jump scare when it’s me”), and one DealDash commercial which appears to still be running: She was paid just $75 for it. “At the time I didn’t have representation. I was just like ‘here are my rates.’”\nBetween 2015 and 2018, DiMercurio also did a lot of voice-over work for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi–connected products and tech how-to videos for everything from speakers to air purifiers. “I got something that was an internet-of-things device—probably three or four of those a week,” she says. “When I got off of those platforms, I think I had done around 9,000 jobs. I mean, we put voices in everything in the late 2010s. Rice cookers and stuff would talk to you; I did a lot of those.”\nSo when friends ask her, Did you do this one? or tell her that they hear her voice when they change the volume on their wireless headphones, she really doesn’t know for sure. “Some of the jobs had the names of products in them, but most were faceless usernames, the standard ‘Bluetooth connected, Bluetooth paired, Bluetooth disconnected.’ A few times I’ve run into it, but by the time it’s in a device, it’s been so compressed, and it’s not my normal speaking voice. I’m like, maybe? That might be me?”\nThe shape of DiMercurio’s multi-hyphenate career so far gives some insight into a few more of the boom-and-bust cycles in online culture and consumer tech, not just that manic IOT phase. Before the Bluetooth speaker years, she was part of the indie fiction podcasting scene in New York, acting in shows like Ars Paradoxica, Archive 81, and Wolf 359. “I got in when you had to explain to people what a podcast was, so there was the indie boom there,” she says. “We’d have these get-togethers, and you’d hear a voice and say ‘Doug Eiffel, is that you?’ This was the Welcome to Nightvale early days. That’s when it felt like the Wild West.”\nLater, at the tail end of the 2010s, DiMercurio combined the tech work with voice-overs for commercials. “We did the auditions in person back then,” she says, “which is kind of insane to think about. I used to take the train for 45 minutes into Manhattan for 20 seconds in a booth to be like, ‘Chips Ahoy! They’re in a bag!’”\nCompanies would share celebrity references for the kind of sound they wanted, and between 2016 and 2019, a few years after Spike Jonze’s Her was released, featuring the AI assistant Samantha, it was Scarlett Johansson notes for almost every job. Except without the signature rasp, higher pitched and less sultry, more excitement. “I learned quickly—the client doesn’t actually know what they want,” she says.\nAround this period, DiMercurio also started transitioning into voice acting for audiobooks, once again getting ahead of some big industry moves. Leading up to and during the pandemic, the likes of Audible and Spotify began pouring money into the original fiction podcast space, including some projects with big budgets and celebrity names, such as Homecoming, Black Box and Bronzeville, all attempting to innovate on more than a century of radio dramas.\nDiMercurio’s opinion is that these were never going to scale in the way big tech expected (“with good mics, good actors, and a good sound designer, a $10,000 podcast can sound just as good as a $500,000 podcast”), but she still accepts occasional scripted podcast gigs, working on Caspian Studios’ Murder in HR last year. Her own labor of love is the “gay and weird” Brimstone Valley Mall, a fun comedy horror podcast set in 1999. She has written, directed, and produced two seasons of the show, which follows a bunch of demons who play in a band and work in a corn dog stand, and in which she gets to satirize her chirpy “commercial” voice as the mall announcer.\nOne narrative twist is that the Bluetooth Lady was not originally a gadgety person at all. After moving from New York to Los Angeles mid-pandemic in early 2021, though, she had to become a tech expert in audio and video out of necessity, to help put together audition tapes for on-camera film and TV roles and voice-over jobs for games and commercials: “Actors are basically our own little production companies now.”\nSince the move, DiMercurio has worked on the fringes of the animation and video game worlds, and she’s itching to get more into animation voice acting in particular. “I’ve done a couple of those mobile gacha games, like Path to Nowhere. It’s these very cutesy, anime girls fighting things. So you go in and you talk with this really high-pitched voice. It’s so fun.” She shouts out the performances of the voice cast of the Netflix sci-fi animation Scavenger’s Reign as a recent favorite: “In the stoic character of the British actor [Wunmi Mosaku], you could still hear the heartbreak and her holding it in, it was amazing work.”\nFast forward a few years in LA, to around this time in 2024, and DiMercurio noticed one big shift. A lot of her corporate, non-client and non-customer-facing work, the industrial jobs she’d been doing in the background for years, dried up completely. “Just gone. And that was AI,” she says. “I knew all that stuff was going to get eaten up, but I thought I had a little bit more time. It was a good chunk of my income that just disappeared. It went down to 50 percent, then dwindled.”\nAlways planning ahead, she had already predicted she would soon be moved out of the corporate circuit because her type of voice was going out of fashion: one that’s older, with discernible vocal training and a lot of enunciation versus “a more authentic, young, hip Gen Z sound of ‘I don’t care, I’m just reading off a page,’” a persona which she does have in her repertoire but may not get booked for. “But it was AI, just like that.” One of the platforms DiMercurio recorded for in the mid-2010s, Voices.com, currently offers an AI-powered tool where you can select a professional voice actor and one of 10 conversational tones, then turn text into speech with its “Studio” feature.\nNow, the game is all audiobooks, all the time, for the Bluetooth Lady and, to some extent, major platforms like Spotify, which is experimenting with pricing tiers and bundles for these formats, and has just launched a new publishing program for indie audiobook authors.\n“You gotta make some quick moves,” she says. “I started auditioning more in the commercial space and jumping into audiobooks, almost full time now.” Despite the fact that startups like Speechki offer synthetic voices for this exact use case, DiMercurio is fairly confident that AI won’t take over audiobook or scripted podcast voice acting anytime soon. “We’re in a space where, when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. You have this big, heavy tool—AI—and we’re just smashing everything we can see with it. It has stuck in certain arenas of voice-over, the ones that don’t need to feel extremely personal. But part of the reason why fiction podcasting became a thing was the intimacy of hearing a person’s voice in your ear.”\nAs an actor, DiMercurio is interested in how many emotions and “micro observations” you can pick up on just by the way someone says a word. Some actors trust their gut, or do an impersonation, and others look at voice granularly, observing, re-creating, and manipulating the speed of the speech, the inflection and the placement, to function as a set of “levers” for, say, producing different audiobook characters.\nWhen it comes to voice-over more generally, she thinks AI is now passable and that we may get to the point where it’s almost as nuanced as talking to a person, but “I don’t think it will ever hit quite the same.”\nIn the short term, she expects a flattening in advertising audio, similar to the sudden homogeneity in graphic design a few years ago when it seemed like all brands started to look the same. “Almost every voice you hear, there’s someone behind that,” she says, “even the AI ones were a person who recorded that at one point.” But AI voices are designed to be palatable to the widest audience possible, “therefore we’re losing the specificity, the identity, the little quirks—like nobody’s s’s whistle like mine do. You don’t think about it, you don’t even hear it, because it’s so neutral.”\nUltimately DiMercurio predicts that voice actors will become a high-end refinement in some industries. “A human voice is going to become bespoke,” she says. “We’re going to become a luxury item, almost thinking of it like artisanship. So if you’re a luxury brand, you’ll have a real person’s voice instead of AI in your commercials and in your products. In the same way that you can get handmade ceramics and bowls or you can buy them from Wal-Mart.”\nA now infamous case study showing the power of a single, distinctive human voice came last May when OpenAI was forced to pause the use of its Sky voice for GPT-4o, one of five initial voices for the chatbot. This came after Scarlett Johansson—yes, her—hired legal counsel, claiming that OpenAI had imitated her after she refused a request from its CEO, Sam Altman, to license her voice for the product and after Altman had tweeted this single-word tweet: her.\nOpenAI denied that Sky was intended to resemble the star, and The Washington Post then compared recordings of the Sky AI voice and those provided by an anonymous actress, reporting them to sound identical. The actress’ agent also sent the Post documents to prove that she was hired for the Sky voice role after an open casting call, months before Altman approached Johansson. The actress also said that neither Scarlett Johansson nor the movie Her were mentioned by OpenAI staff, who specified that they wanted a “warm, engaging” and “charismatic” voice.\nDiMercurio refers to the whole ChatGPT ScarJo incident as a “debacle” but notes there is a funny twist related to her own voice acting. In 2023, the developers behind the Zombies, Run! fitness game released a Marvel tie-in for iPhone and Android named Marvel Move, featuring interactive adventures where you’re instructed to run around with Thor, the X-Men, and The Hulk in order to save the world.\n“I got hired to play Black Widow in that game. I was thinking, ‘I finally get to do Scarlett Johansson,’” she says with a laugh. “Then we get in there and they say, ‘We don’t want this to sound like her. We want this to be completely new.’ I was like, when do I get to have my Her moment? But I got to go home and tell my mom I played Black Widow.”\nStill, DiMercurio probably gets her Her moment every day, every time thousands, maybe millions of people hear the words “Bluetooth connected.”",

    "content_text": "Last week, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney declared that the “old relationship” his country had with the United States was “over,” and it’s “clear the US is no longer a reliable partner.” Carney’s comments came after the US announced sweeping new tariffs on Canada and President Donald Trump spent months making inflammatory comments that have alarmed Canada’s leaders, including suggestions that the country would be “better off” if it was annexed by the US. Tensions finally boiled over last Wednesday when Trump said he will impose 25 percent tariffs on foreign-made cars, a move that could have a major negative economic impact on Canada—once one of America’s staunchest allies.\nAmong Canadians in Silicon Valley, the rift between the two nations is sparking a new kind of national pride, as well as a lot of uncertainty. For now, at least, Trump’s tariffs on Canada don’t extend to software, so the flow of digital goods and services between the two countries remains mostly uninterrupted. But the chaos has prompted some prominent founders and investors to urge young Canadians to build companies at home and strengthen the local tech ecosystem, while Canadian tech companies with large operations in the US are wondering if they need to change strategies, or even headquarters.\n“I think the biggest thing happening right now is that Canadian founders are having to adjust to a new reality in which two fundamental assumptions we've taken for granted for decades can no longer be counted on,” says Chris Neumann, a Vancouver-based venture capitalist and former startup founder. “Namely, that the US is a reliable trading partner and that the US and Canada have a stable, mutually beneficial free-trade agreement.\"\nAt the same time, some Canadians tell WIRED that the social and financial capital of Silicon Valley remain huge draws for tech workers. Many ambitious entrepreneurs would still jump at the chance to join the Y Combinator tech accelerator in the US, for example, “whether they’re coming from Canada or coming from Argentina,” says Michael Buhr, the executive director of C100, a nonprofit networking group for Canadians in Silicon Valley.\n“I like to joke that you can’t put a tariff on talent,” Brandon Waselnuk, an executive at the documentation app Mintlify, said at an event in California last week.\nWaselnuk is originally from Ottawa but now lives and works in San Francisco. Back in January, he put out a call on social media to find other Canadians in tech who, like him, might be feeling unsettled by rising tensions between the US and their home country. A number of Canadians got in touch, and Waselnuk began organizing local events for what he dubbed the “Maple Syrup Gang.” The first outing was a city rucking and chocolate tasting excursion co-led by his wife.\nWaselnuk hosted last week’s gathering at the sleek offices of Bain Capital in downtown San Francisco. Around 60 entrepreneurs and venture capitalists from Canada gathered to watch startup demos while noshing on pizza and poutine. Greeting people near the entrance, Waselnuk appeared quintessentially Canadian, both in terms of affability and attire. He wore a hat emblazoned with what he explained was the logo for Trans Canada Trail. His red maple-leaf T-shirt, however, required no explaining.\n“Some of the Canadians in the group have been asking, ‘Should we relocate our office? Should we change our approach?’” Waselnuk said. “But we don’t really know what’s going to happen. If anything, America doesn’t know either. Canadians don’t want these problems. We just want to get along.”\nAlysaa Co, a principal at Bain Capital Ventures and fellow Canadian, agreed. She noted that one of Bain’s portfolio companies, a Toronto-based fintech startup, has been serving US-based small businesses since its inception. Ideally, Co said, the startup won’t have to rethink that strategy.\nSome in the Maple Syrup Gang poked fun at the US and American culture. One entrepreneur, who showed off an AI-powered tool for helping kids learn math, asked the crowd to roast him and provide brutally honest feedback on his app. “Pretend like you’re from Texas. Or pretend you’re Trump,” he said.\nCanadian pride and nationalist sentiment have been on the rise since Trump began threatening America’s northern neighbor and took a hard line on trade. The percentage of Canadians who say they’re “very proud” of their country jumped significantly in February from just a couple months prior, according to data analysis from the Angus Reid Institute, a Canadian nonprofit research organization. As Canada gears up for national elections in a few weeks, the two major political parties are emphasizing the importance of “Canada First” and defending national sovereignty. Carney’s Liberal Party, which was sinking in the polls before Trump’s rhetoric toward Canada turned dark, has seen its popularity surge as the prime minister, a former banker, positioned himself as the best candidate to protect Canada’s economy.\nThis growing sense of Canadian national pride has trickled into the tech sector, too, where some investors and startup founders view the divisiveness between the US and Canada as an opportunity to boost their country’s productivity and self-reliance. A group of Canadian tech entrepreneurs, including executives from Shopify and Cohere, recently spun up a promotional campaign called Build Canada with the goal of influencing policy on technology, tax reform, and immigration. An article in the Canadian blog Betakit reported that these tech leaders have been “frustrated by the Liberal government and the country’s long-standing productivity woes.”\n“In hindsight we will look at these US tariffs as an important wake-up call for [Canada],” Boris Wertz, founder of Vancouver-based Version One ventures and a former board partner at Andreessen Horowitz, said on X in early February. Canada should diversify its international trading partners away from the US, deregulate inter-provincial trade, and double down on energy infrastructure, Wertz wrote. He also included “border security/tough on crime” as an agenda item.\nCanada has been a significant source of tech talent in Silicon Valley since the North American Free Trade Agreement was put in place in 1994, which included a program granting an unlimited number of visas for skilled professionals looking to move from Canada or Mexico to the US. (NAFTA was replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, or USMCA, in 2020.) Canadians who work in tech can quickly rattle off the names of unicorn founders and other notable figures who are originally from their home country, including Uber cofounder Garrett Camp, Notion cofounder Ivan Zhao, Cloudflare cofounder Michelle Zatlyn, and Pebble creator Eric Migicovsky—not to mention the thousands of Canadian engineers who toil away on products behind the scenes.\nBut Canadians have also lamented the brain drain to the Valley and the lost opportunities it represents for Canada’s growth. Amid the current artificial intelligence boom that has prompted another wave of talented engineers to flock to the US, Canada’s governments and industry leaders “should be addressing this problem with the urgency of a five-alarm fire,” software developer Bilal Akhtar argued in an op-ed in the Toronto Star last year.\n“Some of the most notable academicians in the fields of AI and machine learning, such as Geoffrey Hinton and Ilya Sutskever, hail from the University of Toronto,” Akhtar wrote. “We’ve just failed to build a big enough ecosystem around any of that.”\nCanada’s talent bleed may be stanched slightly by rising tensions with the US, which have created, in some cases, literal barriers to entry that were once unimaginable between friendly neighbors. Security concerns about traveling across the southern border increased in Canada after the story of a Canadian woman who was detained for two weeks by US immigration authorities went viral earlier this month. Flight bookings to the US during the upcoming summer travel season have plummeted.\nOne Canadian attendee at the Maple Syrup Gang event told WIRED he’s currently interning at an American electric car company and had never been to the United States before taking the gig. He now wants to stay and find a full-time job in Silicon Valley, but his father already told him he wouldn’t visit him if he remained in the US.\nBuhr, who runs the C100 networking group for Canadians in Silicon Valley, says there are critical cultural differences between the two tech ecosystems that have hindered Canada. The country has “one unicorn a decade, and the US has 10 unicorns a year,” Buhr says, citing ecommerce platform Shopify as Canada’s current shining tech star. (Almost everyone cites Shopify as Canada’s shining tech star.)\nHe pointed to Silicon Valley’s well-known flywheel effect, where if a tech worker is extremely successful and becomes wealthy, they’ll invest money back into the ecosystem and create new opportunities for others. “That flywheel does not exist in Canada, and if it does, it’s on a 10-year cycle,” he says.\nBuhr adds that he wants to help his fellow Canadians increase their appetite for risk. “We need to raise the hubris of Canadian entrepreneurs a little bit, and be more American in that sense, so that they’re saying ‘I can change the world,’ and not, ‘I can buy a cottage a year from now.’” As the relationship between the US and Canada goes through a radical transformation, the world those entrepreneurs are seeking to change could soon look very different.\nCorrection 3/31/25 4:37 PM EST: This story has been updated to more accurately reflect Chris Neumann's work history.",

    "content_text": "Tens of thousands of explicit AI-generated images, including AI-generated child sexual abuse material, were left open and accessible to anyone on the internet, according to new research seen by WIRED. An open database belonging to an AI image-generation firm contained more than 95,000 records, including some prompt data and images of celebrities such as Ariana Grande, the Kardashians, and Beyoncé de-aged to look like children.\nThe exposed database, which was discovered by security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who shared details of the leak with WIRED, is linked to South Korea–based website GenNomis. The website and its parent company, AI-Nomis, hosted a number of image generation and chatbot tools for people to use. More than 45 GB of data, mostly made up of AI images, was left in the open.\nThe exposed data provides a glimpse at how AI image-generation tools can be weaponized to create deeply harmful and likely nonconsensual sexual content of adults and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). In recent years, dozens of “deepfake” and “nudify” websites, bots, and apps have mushroomed and caused thousands of women and girls to be targeted with damaging imagery and videos. This has come alongside a spike in AI-generated CSAM.\n“The big thing is just how dangerous this is,” Fowler says of the data exposure. “Looking at it as a security researcher, looking at it as a parent, it’s terrifying. And it's terrifying how easy it is to create that content.”\nFowler discovered the open cache of files—the database was not password protected or encrypted—in early March and quickly reported it to GenNomis and AI-Nomis, pointing out that it contained AI CSAM. GenNomis quickly closed off the database, Fowler says, but it did not respond or contact him about the findings.\nNeither GenNomis nor AI-Nomis responded to multiple requests for comment from WIRED. However, hours after WIRED contacted the organizations, websites for both companies appeared to be shut down, with the GenNomis website now returning a 404 error page.\n“This example also shows—yet again—the disturbing extent to which there is a market for AI that enables such abusive images to be generated,” says Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University in the UK who specializes in online- and image-based abuse. “This should remind us that the creation, possession, and distribution of CSAM is not rare, and attributable to warped individuals.”\nBefore it was wiped, GenNomis listed multiple different AI tools on its homepage. These included an image generator allowing people to enter prompts of images they want to create, or upload an image and include a prompt to alter it. There was also a face-swapping tool, a background remover, plus an option to turn videos into images.\n“The most disturbing thing, obviously, was the child explicit images and seeing ones that were clearly celebrities reimagined as children,” Fowler says. The researcher explains that there were also AI-generated images of fully clothed young girls. He says in those instances, it is unclear whether the faces used are completely AI-generated or based on real images.\nAs well as CSAM, Fowler says, there were AI-generated pornographic images of adults in the database plus potential “face-swap” images. Among the files, he observed what appeared to be photographs of real people, which were likely used to create “explicit nude or sexual AI-generated images,” he says. “So they were taking real pictures of people and swapping their faces on there,” he claims of some generated images.\nWhen it was live, the GenNomis website allowed explicit AI adult imagery. Many of the images featured on its homepage, and an AI “models” section included sexualized images of women—some were “photorealistic” while others were fully AI-generated or in animated styles. It also included a “NSFW” gallery and “marketplace” where users could share imagery and potentially sell albums of AI-generated photos. The website’s tagline said people could “generate unrestricted” images and videos; a previous version of the site from 2024 said “uncensored images” could be created.\nGenNomis’ user policies stated that only “respectful content” is allowed, saying “explicit violence” and hate speech is prohibited. “Child pornography and any other illegal activities are strictly prohibited on GenNomis,” its community guidelines read, saying accounts posting prohibited content would be terminated. (Researchers, victims advocates, journalists, tech companies, and more have largely phased out the phrase “child pornography,” in favor of CSAM, over the last decade).\nIt is unclear to what extent GenNomis used any moderation tools or systems to prevent or prohibit the creation of AI-generated CSAM. Some users posted to its “community” page last year that they could not generate images of people having sex and that their prompts were blocked for non-sexual “dark humor.” Another account posted on the community page that the “NSFW” content should be addressed, as it “might be looked upon by the feds.”\n“If I was able to see those images with nothing more than the URL, that shows me that they're not taking all the necessary steps to block that content,” Fowler alleges of the database.\nHenry Ajder, a deepfake expert and founder of consultancy Latent Space Advisory, says even if the creation of harmful and illegal content was not permitted by the company, the website’s branding—referencing “unrestricted” image creation and a “NSFW” section—indicated there may be a “clear association with intimate content without safety measures.”\nAjder says he is surprised the English-language website was linked to a South Korean entity. Last year the country was plagued by a nonconsensual deepfake “emergency” that targeted girls, before it took measures to combat the wave of deepfake abuse. Ajder says more pressure needs to be put on all parts of the ecosystem that allows nonconsensual imagery to be generated using AI. “The more of this that we see, the more it forces the question onto legislators, onto tech platforms, onto web hosting companies, onto payment providers. All of the people who in some form or another, knowingly or otherwise—mostly unknowingly—are facilitating and enabling this to happen,” he says.\nFowler says the database also exposed files that appeared to include AI prompts. No user data, such as logins or usernames, were included in exposed data, the researcher says. Screenshots of prompts show the use of words such as “tiny,” “girl,” and references to sexual acts between family members. The prompts also contained sexual acts between celebrities.\n“It seems to me that the technology has raced ahead of any of the guidelines or controls,” Fowler says. “From a legal standpoint, we all know that child explicit images are illegal, but that didn’t stop the technology from being able to generate those images.”\nAs generative AI systems have vastly enhanced how easy it is to create and modify images in the past two years, there has been an explosion of AI-generated CSAM. “Webpages containing AI-generated child sexual abuse material have more than quadrupled since 2023, and the photorealism of this horrific content has also leapt in sophistication, says Derek Ray-Hill, the interim CEO of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK-based nonprofit that tackles online CSAM.\nThe IWF has documented how criminals are increasingly creating AI-generated CSAM and developing the methods they use to create it. “It’s currently just too easy for criminals to use AI to generate and distribute sexually explicit content of children at scale and at speed,” Ray-Hill says.",

    "content_text": "Elon Musk’s xAI is facing a potential trademark dispute over the name of its chatbot, Grok. The company’s trademark application with the US Patent and Trademark Office has been suspended after the agency argued the name could be confused with that of two other companies, AI chipmaker Groq and software provider Grokstream. Now, a third tech startup called Bizly is claiming it owns the rights to “Grok.”\nThis isn’t the first time Musk has chosen a name for one of his products that other companies say they trademarked first. Last month, Musk’s social media platform settled a lawsuit brought by a marketing firm that claimed it owns exclusive rights to the name X.\nBizly and xAI appear to have arrived at the name Grok independently. Bizly founder Ron Shah says he came up with it during a brainstorming session with a colleague who used the word as a verb. (The phrase “to grok” is frequently used in tech circles to mean “to understand.”) “I was like, that’s exactly the name,” Shah tells WIRED. “We got excited, high-fived, it was the name!”\nMusk has said he named his chatbot after a term used in the 1961 science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land, according to The Times of India. Author Robert A. Heinlein imagined “grok” as a word in a Martian lexicon that also meant “to understand.”\nShah says he applied to trademark the name Grok in 2021. Two years later, he was in the midst of launching an AI-powered app for asynchronous meetings called Grok when Musk announced his chatbot with the same name. “It was a day I’ll never forget,” Shah says. “I woke up and looked at my phone, and there were so many messages from friends saying ‘did you get acquired by Elon? Congrats!’ It was a complete shock to me.”\nShah insists xAI infringed on his trademark. But under US law, trademark regulations are primarily designed to protect consumers rather than companies, says Josh Gerben, founder of Gerben IP, a law firm focused exclusively on trademarks. “The goal is to not have confusion as to who is behind a product or service,” he says.\nFor example, Musk’s former partner Grimes also trademarked the name Grok for a plushie AI-powered kids toy, but that application is very different from a software tool, reducing the likelihood of consumers getting them mixed up. “The details matter,” Gerben says. \"What does the original Grok do, and what does this new one do? Are they operating in the same channel of trade?”\nIn Bizly’s case, the answers to those questions are fairly murky. One of the requirements of registering a trademark is that owners need to demonstrate it is being used to sell goods or services in at least two states. The USPTO also allows people to file a trademark to reserve the rights to a name before a business is launched, but they can’t actually register it until, say, their jewelry website is fully up and running or their pizza parlor chain expands into a neighboring state.\nWhen Musk announced he was launching his chatbot, Shah says, Bizly was still in beta and conducting a pilot of its Grok app with the financial services company Carta. The startup was about to close a fundraising round, but Shah says the deal fell apart due to investor concerns over the trademark dispute. The fact that Bizly's Grok never made it to the market (and is not currently available) could potentially call into question what trademark rights the company can enforce.\nNow, Shah says, his company is on the brink of shutting down. He hoped to resolve the matter with xAI amicably—even offering to partner with Musk’s company or sell it the Grok trademark for a fair price. “We spent $2m building our Grok product and business and our funding round collapsed once Mr. Musk announced his use of the mark,” Shah wrote in an email to xAI attorney Robert Keele last Monday. “We are on the verge of company shutdown and need to recoup the damages in order to survive.”\nBut Musk has been known to bend existing rules to his will, including when it comes to the branding of his companies. After he renamed Twitter X, Apple appeared to give the social media platform an exception to its rules prohibiting single-character app names, and it was allowed to remain in the App Store under its new moniker. xAI did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\nNeuralink, Musk’s brain-implant company, has also stepped into potentially thorny naming territory. The startup recently applied to trademark the names “Telepathy” and “Telekinesis,” WIRED previously reported. But words that describe a feature of a product or service, like telepathy, cannot typically be trademarked. Neuralink’s applications are still pending review by the USPTO.\nShah says he has yet to send xAI a formal demand letter from a lawyer, initiating a lawsuit that could result in xAI forfeiting the name—or filing a countersuit. “Who am I to go legal with the richest man in the world?” he asks. So far, he claims, no one from xAI has responded to his emails.\nUpdate 3/31/25 at 11:20 EST: This article has been updated to clarify that Bizly's Grok app was to be used for asynchronous meetings.",

Subscribe Today.\nYour Retro Gaming Questions, Answered\nWhat Are Retro Gaming Consoles?\nRetro gaming consoles are older game systems or new systems designed to play old games. Some retro gaming consoles are based on a specific original, others run games from various older consoles and home computers. Retro gaming consoles come in all shapes and sizes, but most are under-the-TV consoles or handhelds. The rules about what can be considered retro are not carved in stone, but the term is usually applied to stuff that is at least 15 years old. With that in mind, everything from early arcade cabinets to the original Atari and Nintendo consoles to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox can be considered retro.\nWhat Were the Best-Selling Consoles of All Time?\nSony’s PlayStation 2 is the best-selling console of all time, with almost 160 million sold. The Nintendo DS is second at around 155 million, the Nintendo Switch has sold around 140 million so far, the Game Boy and Game Boy Color reached around 119 million sales, and Sony sold 117 million PlayStation 4 consoles.\nCan I Use My Old Retro Game Cartridges?\nIt depends on the console, but retro gaming systems like the Polymega and some of Analogue’s consoles can play the original cartridges and discs that ran on old systems. It might be time to dig that box of old cartridges out of your attic or basement.\nAre Retro Games a Good Investment?\nThe short answer is no. Most games fall in value. Some rare older titles might be worth big bucks, but you need to do your research. Because retro game collecting is quite popular, prices have risen for many older systems. If you were planning to turn a profit, there’s a sweet spot at the end of a system’s life where games and hardware can be picked up cheap, but it will be several years before these things are considered collectible and prices begin to rise again.\nAre Emulators Legal? What About ROMs?\nEmulation software is legal, but playing licensed games you have not purchased is illegal. ROM stands for Read Only Memory. ROMs in the context of retro gaming are digital copies of video games. If you own a physical game and rip the contents to make your own backup copy, that’s within your rights, but it is illegal to distribute ROMs. Downloading ROMs from the internet is piracy and subject to copyright infringement. Downloading a ROM for a game you physically own is considered a gray area by many, but it is strictly speaking still illegal.\nWhat About Nintendo Fans?\nIt’s a shame that two of the best retro gaming consoles in recent years, the NES Classic Mini and the SNES Classic Mini, have been discontinued. Both feature great designs with a miniaturized look that’s true to the originals, silky performance, and strong game lineups of Nintendo’s greatest hits. You can still buy them online (usually from third-party resellers), but prices are seriously inflated. The SNES Classic Mini, for example, was $80 at launch, but a reseller has it for more than $320 on Amazon right now. You might have better luck buying one used.\nNintendo fans keen on some classic gaming action are better served snagging a Nintendo Switch and buying a Nintendo Switch Online membership ($20 for a year) to access more than 100 NES and SNES titles (here’s the full list). Add the Expansion Pack ($50 for a year) and you can get these N64 games too. If you’re craving some old-school pocket-sized Nintendo fun, check out the revived Game & Watch ($55) line. They are limited to a couple of games each, but when those games are Super Mario or Zelda titles, that can be enough for hours of fun.\nOther Retro Consoles\nThe Analogue Mega SG ($200) (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is expensive, and it doesn’t come with any games or controllers (they cost $25 apiece). But it can play old Sega Genesis cartridges, so it’s a solid choice if you have a box of them in the basement. Thanks to an FPGA chip, this console runs the original games just as you remember them.\nModRetro Chromatic for $199: The ModRetro Chromatic is a beautifully built handheld capable of playing original Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. It feels authentic, boasts great battery life (three AA batteries), responsive controls, a solid speaker, and a display bright enough to use outdoors. I instantly lost an hour playing Tetris. ModRetro has eschewed modern additions like saves or downloadable games, but is publishing new titles on Game Boy cartridges. As lovely as this retro handheld is, to say that ModRetro founder Palmer Luckey is controversial is putting it mildly, and that could be enough to put you off.\nThere are plenty of classic arcade games available on PlayStation 4 or 5. If you opt for a PS Plus Premium subscription ($18 for a month or $160 for a year), you get the Classics Catalog, packed with old PlayStation games.\nThe Xbox Series X|S boasts the best backward compatibility, as Microsoft’s newest consoles can play Xbox One, Xbox 360, and original Xbox titles. You can also find classic titles included in our favorite gaming subscription, the excellent Xbox Game Pass Ultimate ($20 per month).\nIf you have Valve’s Steam Deck, check out the comprehensive EmuDeck to emulate a wide variety of old systems in style. PC gamers also have an enormous choice of emulators. I like RetroArch because it emulates multiple systems, but if you have a favorite old console and want to get close to that original experience, you can likely find a tailor-made emulator to scratch that itch.\nThe Panic Playdate ($229) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) isn’t strictly a retro console, but it is fun, creative, and quirky, and it has a distinct retro feel. It even has a crank for an all-new way to interact with games!\nThe Analogue Duo ($250) (6/10, WIRED Review) makes TurboGrafx-16 and PC Engine games look incredible on any HDMI screen. It boasts HuCARD and CD-ROM functionality, so existing games work regardless of media, region, or other requirements. Sadly, it’s pricey, controllers cost extra, and there’s no openFPGA support.\nFinally, if you miss all those Flash-based browser games you used to play in the office when you were meant to be working, read this guide: How to Play All of Those Old Flash Games You Remember.",

    "content_text": "Way back in 2018, I went to South Korea for a wedding. While there, I persuaded an elderly friend of my sister-in-law to show me how she made kimchi. When we arrived at her apartment, the living-room furniture had been pushed aside to make space. She spread a tarp across the floor and set out giant stainless steel bowls of prepped veggies, a bucket of napa cabbage she'd started salting the night before, and two kinds of fish sauce, one of them in a five-liter jug. What impressed me the most was what wasn't there: no recipes and no scale.\nWe worked through the whole process. Or really, she did. I mostly observed and took notes in awe as she eyeballed vast quantities of food, even the high-impact ingredients that, in inexperienced hands, can turn the end product into a salty disaster. When she finished and filed the kimchi in a special fridge on the porch, my lasting impression was of how she was able to do it without measuring a thing.\nAs a religious follower of recipes, I left that apartment feeling like I'd been to a magic show. I thought I'd come for hands-on time and a pro-level kimchi recipe but quickly realized I just wanted to understand how she had mastered salt.\nSalt is one of the pillars of fermentation. Too little opens the door to unwanted results like mold, and too much just overloads and shorts out your palate. The right amount, however, encourages healthy bacteria to develop complex flavors, while simultaneously and amazingly killing off what's harmful. I'm an avid but conservative fermenter, which means I enjoy the relative certainty of using salt by weight percentages. I put what I'm fermenting on the scale, then mix in a percentage of that weight in salt. I am completely impressed by those who can wing it.\nA pandemic or so after my first kimchi lesson in Seoul, I returned to better understand how they do it, this time making a smaller kitchen-countertop batch with Soo Jin Lee, my in-laws’ nanny. Soo Jin grew up with seven siblings in the southwestern Korean province Jeollabuk-do, where she and one other sister were her mother's primary helpers, but I was surprised by her answer when she said where she learned to cook.\n“Of course, I learned from my family, but my favorite tips come from TV.”\nWhatever the source, she had a cooking style that spoke of ease and experience. By the time I arrived, she was already well prepped, with three quartered heads of napa cabbage she had soaked overnight in a salty brine, all neatly piled and draining on a dish rack. She'd also portioned out broth ingredients and prepped piles of garlic, ginger, scallions, apple, Asian pear, Korean radish, and onion. A bag of bright red gochugaru—the pepper powder that gives kimchi its brilliant hue and fiery flavor—sat on the counter.\nMaking kimchi can be complicated, because it often contains multiple salt sources: a fish sauce or two, potentially joined by saeujeot (tiny fermented shrimp), plus the salt in the cabbage that may have brined overnight. The idea of making an educated guess on these ingredient quantities gives me the willies. With all of those copious raw flavors, I wanted to understand what Soo Jin was doing to know that she was on the right track.\nFor kimchi's European cousin, sauerkraut, it's usually more straightforward. When I make it, I weigh out chopped cabbage and other veggies, then calculate 2 percent of that weight to determine how much salt to add. So, a kilo of kraut gets 20 grams of salt. That formula—two percent of salt by weight—is a great starting point for all kinds of fermentation and might change a bit from recipe to recipe depending on what you're fermenting, but it's a great thing to have in your back pocket.\nIt turned out Soo Jin wasn't completely winging it. She used a 200-milliliter paper cup as a sort of measuring device from time to time to keep her in the ballpark, then fine-tuned from there by tasting.\nWhile her brined cabbage quarters dripped into the sink, she puréed onion, ginger, garlic, apple, and Korean radish with a dasima (dried kelp) broth that had been fortified with dried prawns and a dried pollack head.\nAt this point, she put on a pair of gloves, a step that no one who will later use their hands to touch other sensitive body parts should skip. She grabbed the gochugaru, poured it over a bowl of Korean radish chopped into matchsticks, added 150 milliliters-plus-a-splash of fish sauce, then a big spoonful of saujeot—salt and salt, really—before taking a tiny bite. Next, she threw in 30-odd quartered scallions and gave it all a mighty two-handed stir before dividing the mixture into three bowls, one for each head of cabbage.\nEvery cabbage leaf got attention, a dollop of paste spread on each, before the soft, leafy end of each quarter was folded down, and the whole thing carefully swaddled inside the outermost leaf. Since my sister-in-law translated, Soo Jin had not addressed me directly the whole time I was there, but here she turned to me and deposited one spicy, garlicky cabbage leaf rolled into a bite-sized dumpling, directly into my mouth with her still-gloved hand, then made one for herself. Our noses ran and our eyes went wide. It was raw, but good. I was glad I had that taste, a benchmark before salt, microbes, and time started doing their thing in earnest.\nAnd there, as salty sweat beaded on my scalp, was my answer: Taste as you go. Whether it's what their families taught them or something they'd picked up on TV, or both, my Korean guides weren't flying blind. The flavors they created during kimchi making were strong, sometimes extremely so, but by tasting along the way they could confirm where they were on the map and know whether they were heading in the right direction or needed to course correct. If it was tasting particularly salty in an early step, they could back off a bit later and know that flavors would mellow and change as the kimchi fermented.\nBack at home in Seattle, I made batches using recipes from trusted sources like Eric Kim and Deuki Hong. I wasn't at the point where I could wing it—far from it, really—but I tasted as I went and was learning those benchmark flavors, and I could imagine getting there one day.",

Learn more.\nThe original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\n“Obviously” is a dangerous word, even in scenarios that seem simple. Suppose, for instance, you need to do an important computation. You get to choose between two computers that are almost identical, except that one has an extra hard drive full of precious family photos. It’s natural to assume that the two options are equally good—that an extra drive with no space remaining won’t aid your computation.\n“Obviously, it doesn’t help, right?” said Bruno Loff, a computer scientist at the University of Lisbon.\nWrong. In 2014, Loff and four other researchers discovered that adding full storage space can in principle make computers more powerful. Their theoretical framework, called catalytic computing, has become an object of study in its own right. And recently, it also helped researchers prove a startling result in a related area of computer science: The standard approach to resolving a major open question about the role of memory in computation is most likely a dead end.\n“It’s quite a feat,” said Pierre McKenzie, a complexity theorist at the University of Montreal. “I really appreciate these results.”\nAlmost No Memory\nCatalytic computing grew out of work in computational complexity theory, the branch of computer science focused on the resources needed to solve different problems. All the problems that complexity theorists consider can be solved with step-by-step procedures called algorithms. But all algorithms are not created equal—some run faster than others or demand less space in a computer’s memory. Complexity theorists sort problems into different classes based on the behavior of the best algorithms known to solve them.\nThe most famous class, dubbed “P,” contains all problems known to have fast algorithms, such as finding the smallest number in a list or finding the shortest path between two points in a network. Another class, called “L,” sets a higher bar for membership: Problems in L must have algorithms that not only are fast, but also use barely any memory. The “smallest number in a list” problem is one example. By definition, every problem in L is also in P, but researchers have long wondered if the reverse is also true.\n“The basic question is: Can I take any problem in P and solve it using very, very little memory?” McKenzie said.\nMost researchers suspect the answer is no. To prove it, they’ll need to choose a specific problem in P and show that it’s impossible to solve with any clever memory-saving trick.\nIn the late 2000s, McKenzie and the pioneering complexity theorist Stephen Cook devised a problem that seemed like a promising candidate. Called the tree evaluation problem, it involves repeatedly solving a simpler math problem that turns a pair of input numbers into a single output. Copies of this math problem are arranged in layers like the matches in a tournament bracket: The outputs of each layer become the inputs to the next layer until there’s just one output remaining. Different tree evaluation algorithms represent different strategies for calculating this final output from the initial inputs—they might perform the calculations in a different order, or record the results of intermediate steps in a different way.\nMany algorithms can solve the tree evaluation problem quickly, putting it in the class P. But every such algorithm must devote some memory to the numbers it’s working with, while also storing numbers it’s already calculated for use in later steps. That’s why Cook and McKenzie suspected that the problem was impossible to solve using limited memory. They formalized this intuition in a 2010 paper coauthored with three other researchers, and proved that every ordinary algorithm for solving the tree evaluation problem required too much memory to qualify for membership in L.\nBut their work didn’t rule out the possibility of bizarre algorithms that could somehow use the same piece of memory for storage and calculations simultaneously—the computing equivalent of using a page filled with important notes as scratch paper. Cook and McKenzie thought such outlandish algorithms couldn’t exist, and they were confident enough to put money on it: Anyone who could prove them wrong would win a cool $100.\nCatalytic Conversion\nMichal Koucký, a complexity theorist at Charles University in Prague, learned about the tree evaluation result from Cook during a 2011 sabbatical in Toronto. He grew determined to finish what Cook and McKenzie had started, by proving that there’s no way to do additional computations using memory that’s saving data for later. Koucký’s quest would lead him on an unexpected detour to the discovery of catalytic computing. Nearly a decade later, that discovery would inspire two young researchers to return to tree evaluation and settle Cook and McKenzie’s bet once and for all.\nBut back to the story of catalytic computing. It all started when Koucký visited colleagues in Amsterdam and posed the question that had been preoccupying him in simpler terms: What can you do with memory that’s already full?\n“Nothing” was the obvious answer. “I thought, ‘OK, this is of course very useless, and we’re going to prove it,’” said Harry Buhrman, the leader of the Amsterdam group. “And then we couldn’t prove it.”\nThe breakthrough came months later, when Buhrman was visiting his frequent collaborator Richard Cleve at the University of Waterloo. They decided to focus on an extreme scenario, one where the full memory is very large. If a computer with little free memory can access this massive full memory, would that enable it to solve problems that would be impossible with the free memory alone? It’s like the “hard drive full of family photos” question, but with a hard drive the size of a data center.\nIf that extra data is untouchable—you can’t interact with it at all—then it definitely doesn’t help. But what if you’re allowed to tweak some of the bits encoding this data, as long as you promise to reset them when you’re done? You can’t simply keep a record of your changes, since that would take up even more space, so instead you’ll have to ensure that your changes are easily reversible. What’s more, you don’t get to choose the content of the extra data, so whatever you do must work for any possible initial configuration of bits.\nThose are pretty stringent constraints, so it wasn’t obvious that the extra memory could ever prove useful. But to their surprise, Buhrman and Cleve showed that if you tweak bits in just the right way, you really can get extra computational oomph out of a full memory.\n“That was a shocker for everyone,” said Loff, who was a graduate student in Buhrman’s group at the time, working on the memory question with his fellow student Florian Speelman. The team soon extended the result to an even larger class of problems, and published their combined results in 2014.\nThey named the new framework catalytic computing, borrowing a term from chemistry. “Without the catalyst, the reaction would not have proceeded,” said Raghunath Tewari, a complexity theorist at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. “But the catalyst itself remains unchanged.”\nNot Far From the Tree\nA small band of researchers continued to develop catalytic computing further, but no one even tried to apply it to the tree evaluation problem that had initially inspired Koucký’s quest. For that problem, the remaining open question was whether a small amount of memory could be used for storage and computation simultaneously. But the techniques of catalytic computing relied on the extra, full memory being very large. Shrink that memory and the techniques no longer work.\nStill, one young researcher couldn’t help wondering whether there was a way to adapt those techniques to reuse memory in a tree evaluation algorithm. His name was James Cook, and for him the tree evaluation problem was personal: Stephen Cook, the legendary complexity theorist who invented it, is his father. James had even worked on it in graduate school, though he mostly focused on completely unrelated subjects. By the time he encountered the original catalytic computing paper in 2014, James was about to graduate and leave academia for software engineering. But even as he settled into his new job, he kept thinking about catalytic computing.\n“I had to understand it and see what could be done,” he said.\nFor years, James Cook tinkered with a catalytic approach to the tree evaluation problem in his spare time. He gave a talk about his progress at a 2019 symposium in honor of his father’s groundbreaking work in complexity theory. After the talk, he was approached by a graduate student named Ian Mertz, who’d fallen in love with catalytic computing five years earlier after learning about it as an impressionable young undergrad.\n“It was like a baby bird imprinting scenario,” Mertz said.\nCook and Mertz joined forces, and their efforts soon paid off. In 2020, they devised an algorithm that solved the tree evaluation problem with less memory than a necessary minimum conjectured by the elder Cook and McKenzie—though it was just barely below that threshold. Still, that was enough to collect on the $100 bet; conveniently for the Cooks, half of it stayed in the family.\nBut there was still work to do. Researchers had started studying tree evaluation because it seemed as if it might finally provide an example of a problem in P that’s not in L—in other words, a relatively easy problem that can’t be solved using very little memory. Cook and Mertz’s new method used less memory than any other tree evaluation algorithm, but it still used significantly more than any algorithm for a problem in L. Tree evaluation was down, but not out.\nIn 2023, Cook and Mertz came out with an improved algorithm that used much less memory—barely more than the maximum allowed for problems in L. Many researchers now suspect that tree evaluation is in L after all, and that a proof is only a matter of time. Complexity theorists may need a different approach to the P versus L problem.\nMeanwhile, Cook and Mertz’s results have galvanized interest in catalytic computing, with new works exploring connections to randomness and the effects of allowing a few mistakes in resetting the full memory to its original state.\n“We’ve not finished exploring what we can do with these new techniques,” McKenzie said. “We can expect even more surprises.”\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

Subscribe Today.\nDifferent Types of Tax Services\nThis blanket statement will apply to everything here: You will need to keep in mind what tax documents you have, including various factors like filing status (e.g. married or single), assets, and investments. I’ll be honest, if you have a complicated tax situation or a huge gross income with many investments, I’d advise you to file with an expert. For most of these tax services I tested, they will just file a simple 1040 return for you, with additional filings for additional costs. The majority of online tax services also offer extra assistance from tax preparers.\nDo You Need Extra Assistance?\nMany of these services offer in-person or virtual assistance from a “tax expert,” whose dubious credentials can range from a certified CPA to someone who completed an hours-long training. TurboTax, for example, has AI guidance with Intuit Assist, which answers any questions throughout the process. You can also add Live Assisted for an extra fee, where you get help from live tax experts throughout the process and have the expert review it before submitting. You can also get your taxes done completely from a local tax expert. Most services have a tier system like this, which is helpful for adjusting services based on your individual needs.\nWhat You’ll Need on Hand\nBe sure to gather all tax documents, including W-2s or income reports, health insurance information, education-related tax documents, and any other tax or financial documents relating to purchases or payments on motor vehicles or property. I also had receipts for transactions related to my freelance writing on hand for expensing purposes. If you are using a new service this year, you’ll also want last year’s return in order to transfer any relevant information.\nWhen Do You Need to File an Extension?\nIf you feel you can’t get your state and federal taxes filed by April 15, you’ll need to file an extension by tax day (April 15). This extends your filing deadline to six months later: October 15, 2025. No matter whether you got an extension or not, you may be asked to still pay penalty fines and interest on any unpaid balance. (More on that below.)\nWhat Happens if You Can’t Pay the Full Amount?\nAh, yes, as someone who regularly owes more than $10K in taxes every year (thanks, freelance writing!), here’s where my expertise comes in. If you can’t pay the full amount, you’ll most likely want to set up a payment plan with the IRS to pay in increments over the year. If you didn't file for an extension (and owe taxes), you can face a late-filing penalty of a percentage of the unpaid tax (for late filing and late payment). The government also charges interest on unpaid amounts, which varies depending on your amount and time owed. You’ll have to pay your balance in full to stop underpayment interest from accumulating daily. If you're a gig worker who consistently owes money, I’d definitely start up a quarterly payment plan at the beginning of the year with the IRS to break up the amount, so you aren’t hit with $15K owed by April 15 like me.\nOther Services We Want to Test\nThere are a myriad of online tax services, and we want to do the heavy lifting for you. We’re planning on testing more tax services in the future, and here are some that have caught our attention:\n- Cash App Taxes: A mobile finance tool similar to Venmo, Cash App has taken over for the formerly popular tax service Credit Karma. It has free federal and state filing and free audit defense. However, it doesn’t cover every state, so you’ll have to check if yours is included. You can do your taxes through your computer or phone, but it’s more geared toward a mobile audience, where you can snap a photo of your W-2 within the phone app. Online reviewers have reported that it also doesn’t have as much support as many comparable services, and there is no expert tax help available if you need it. It’s missing many forms and tax topics, and users can’t import 1099s, so it's really only good for W-2 employees. This seems like a good option if you already use Cash App and your taxes are extremely straightforward.\n- Liberty Taxes: You can snap pictures of your tax documents and have an expert file your taxes remotely, or file your own taxes online. They have three different packages, based on need, starting at $50 for federal and $37 for state. The premium (most expensive) package is geared toward self-employed folks like freelancers, but doesn’t list 1099 as a supported document, which gives me pause, since it’s the most commonly used form for self-employed contract workers.\n- TaxSlayer: After reading reviews, this seems to be the best budget tax software pick. It has cheap packages and offers all forms, deductions, and credits at its lowest-price tier, unlike all the others I’ve seen, which charge freelancers the most money since our taxes are the most complicated. Package prices vary, depending on how much help you require from a tax expert. If you have a simple filing and don't need to claim any dependents or tax credits, it may work for you, but TaxSlayer is strict with income limits and filing status restrictions.",

    "content_text": "This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nCities looking to eliminate fossil fuels in buildings have notched a decisive court victory. Last week, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by plumbing and building trade groups against a New York City ban on natural gas in new buildings. The decision is the first to explicitly disagree with a previous ruling that struck down Berkeley, California’s first-in-the-nation gas ban. That order, issued by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2023 and upheld again last year, prompted cities across the country to withdraw or delay laws modeled after the Berkeley ordinance.\nWhile New York City’s law functions differently from Berkeley’s, legal experts say that this month’s decision provides strong legal footing for all types of local policies to phase out gas in buildings—and could encourage cities to once again take ambitious action.\n“It’s a clear win in that regard, because the 9th Circuit decision has had a really chilling effect on local governments,” said Amy Turner, director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “Now there’s something else to point to, and a good reason for hope for local governments that may have back-burnered their building electrification plans to bring those to the forefront again.”\nIn 2021, New York City adopted Local Law 154, which sets an air emissions limit for indoor combustion of fuels within new buildings. Under the law, the burning of “any substance that emits 25 kilograms or more of carbon dioxide per million British thermal units of energy” is prohibited. That standard effectively bans gas-burning stoves, furnaces, and water heaters, and any other fossil-fuel powered appliances. Instead, real estate developers have to install electric appliances, like induction stoves and heat pumps. The policy went into effect in 2024 for buildings under seven stories, and will apply to taller buildings starting in 2027.\nBerkeley’s law, on the other hand, banned the installation of gas piping in new construction. The first-of-its-kind policy was passed in 2019 and inspired nearly a hundred local governments across the country to introduce similar laws. But the ordinance quickly faced a lawsuit by the California Restaurant Association, which argued that gas stoves were essential for the food service industry. In April 2023, the 9th Circuit court ruled in favor of the restaurant industry, holding that federal energy efficiency standards preempted Berkeley’s policy. In January 2024, a petition by the city of Berkeley to rehear the case on the 9th Circuit was denied.\nLast year’s denial of a rehearing included a detailed dissent by eight of the 29 judges on the 9th Circuit, who argued that the court’s ruling had been decided “erroneously” and “urge[d] any future court” considering the same argument “not to repeat the panel opinion’s mistakes.” Writing a dissent at all is unusual for an action as procedural as denying a rehearing, Turner noted. “It was clearly drafted to give a road map to other courts to find differently than the 9th Circuit did.”\nOne year later, that’s exactly what happened. In the New York City lawsuit, building industry groups and a union whose members work on gas infrastructure used the same logic that prevailed in the Berkeley case, arguing that the city’s electrification law is preempted by energy efficiency standards under the federal Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975, or EPCA. This law sets national efficiency standards for major household appliances like furnaces, stoves, and clothes dryers. Under the law, states and cities can’t set their own energy conservation standards that would contradict federal ones. The trade groups argued that EPCA should also preempt any local laws, like New York’s, that would prevent the use of fossil fuel-powered appliances that meet national standards.\n“By design, the city set that level so low as to ban all gas and oil appliances,” the groups wrote in their complaint. “The city’s gas ban thus prohibits all fuel gas appliances, violating federal law” and “presents a significant threat for businesses in New York City that sell, install, and service gas plumbing and infrastructure.”\nCiting the 9th Circuit’s dissent, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed those claims. The plaintiffs’ argument broadens the scope of EPCA beyond reasonable bounds, District Judge Ronnie Abrams wrote in the court’s opinion. Regulating fuel use within certain buildings is standard practice in states and cities, she noted: New York City, for example, has banned the indoor use of kerosene space heaters for decades. “Were plaintiffs correct about the scope of EPCA, these vital safety regulations would likewise be preempted—an absurd result that the court must avoid,” Abrams wrote.\nThe decision could help reassure some states and cities that withdrew electrification plans after the Berkeley case, said Dror Ladin, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, a nonprofit that submitted an amicus brief on behalf of local environmental groups in the lawsuit. “This ruling demonstrates that there’s absolutely no reason to interpret the Berkeley decision so broadly,” he said. The argument brought forth by trade groups “is one that would bar a whole host of health and safety regulations, and alter the power of cities and states in a way that we’ve never seen in this country.”\nBy agreeing with the 9th Circuit dissent’s interpretation of EPCA, last week’s decision bolsters all types of electrification policies, including the one in New York City and those modeled after Berkeley, Turner noted. “This decision we’ve just gotten from the Southern District is more broadly protective,” she said. “Even if the air emissions route is not right for a city for whatever reason, other variations of a building electrification requirement or incentive could pass muster.”\nThe trade groups behind the lawsuit have said they will appeal the decision. Meanwhile, legal challenges using the same arguments brought against Berkeley’s gas ban have been launched against New York’s statewide building code and electrification policies in places like Denver, Montgomery County, Maryland, and Washington, DC.\nJudges in those cases will inevitably refer to the Berkeley decision and last week’s ruling by the Southern District of New York, said Ladin—and he hopes they’ll give more weight to the latter. “Berkeley is not a well-reasoned decision, and this judge saw right through it, and I think many other judges will see through it too.”",

    "content_text": "After senior Trump administration members mistakenly included The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg in a secret group chat about bombing Houthi targets in Yemen, encrypted messaging app Signal found itself at the center of a storm this week. Some commentators criticized the app, going as far to blame it for the scandal.\nBut the whole affair that’s dubiously been dubbed “SignalGate” isn’t about Signal at all: Experts say officials shouldn’t invite untrusted contacts into sensitive chats and should only use authorized devices, platforms, and procedures when discussing top-secret military operations. In other words, the people who set up the chat made numerous mistakes, and they had nothing to do with how secure Signal is. In fact, Signal has seen its biggest-ever spike in US downloads as a result of the news.\nIn other news linked to that Houthi group chat, national security adviser Mike Waltz—an account with the name “Michael Waltz” originally invited Goldberg to the group—left his Venmo account open to public view. As WIRED reported, a “Michael Waltz” Venmo account displayed the names of the adviser’s colleagues and friends, revealing people in Waltz’s wider social network. After WIRED reached out to the White House, the Waltz account hid its friends list. There’s more though: WIRED also discovered other Venmo accounts linked to officials in the Signal chat. Information about who officials associate with could be highly lucrative for foreign spies and hackers.\nElsewhere, we reported on all the ways the White House adopting Elon Musk’s Starlink as an alternative Wi-Fi network could be bad news for network security. There are also early signs in Europe that some companies are going cold on cloud services from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, as they reassess the risks of dealing with the volatile second Trump administration. And, as crossing the United States border becomes more perilous—for both citizens and visa holders—we updated our guide to keeping your digital privacy intact when you are entering the US.\nThat’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click on the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\nTop US Security Officials’ Passwords and Personal Phone Numbers Discovered Online\nOn top of SignalGate and Venmo accounts being left exposed, German news outlet Der Spiegel reported that sensitive personal information linked to several senior Trump administration security officials is easily discoverable online. Reporters from the publication found that mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and “some” passwords for top officials could be found on the internet.\nUsing people-search engines and information contained in public data breaches, Der Spiegel discovered personal information belonging to Waltz, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense. “Most of these numbers and email addresses are apparently still in use, with some of them linked to profiles on social media platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn,” the news organization reported. The details were also linked to Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, Signal, and WhatsApp accounts used by the officials.\nWhile millions of people have been caught up in online data breaches and use inadequate privacy settings on their online accounts, high-level government security officials are exposed to a broader and more severe range of online threats, particularly from nation-state hackers, than most people. Officials told the news organization that many of the accounts and personal details were no longer used or had been updated. However, messages Der Spiegel sent to WhatsApp and Signal accounts belonging to Waltz and Gabbard were delivered, the publication reported. Only after they approached the government for comment were some of the accounts restricted.\nInternet Restrictions May Hide Initial Toll of Myanmar Earthquake Damage\nOn Friday, a huge 7.7-magnitude earthquake and aftershock hit Myanmar, with widespread damage being reported hundreds of miles away in Thailand. At the time of writing, at least 144 people have been confirmed dead with hundreds of others injured in Myanmar. As the first impacts of the devastating quake started to emerge, The New York Times reported that long-standing and widespread internet restrictions in worn-torn Myanmar were likely making it harder for news of the damage to be understood. Since the country’s military junta took power in 2021, connectivity within Myanmar has been widely disrupted or blocked. For instance in 2023, 13 out of Myanmar’s 14 states faced internet disruptions.\nIn the wake of the earthquake, more video footage and news could be seen immediately emerging from neighbouring Thailand, experts told the Times. “Compare the coverage of the earthquake in Thailand, where tremors and damage have been extensively reported, posted and documented, to Myanmar, where we still don’t have a clear picture of the extent of the damage and loss and may not for some time,” Joe Freeman from Amnesty International said. The lack of connectivity may also make the recovery and humanitarian efforts harder to coordinate, once again highlighting the vital need for people to have reliable and open access to the internet.\nAlleged Snowflake Hacker Connor Moucka Agrees to US Extradition\nLast summer’s Snowflake hacking spree, where customers of the cloud storage company had their accounts targeted, was likely one of the largest mass data exfiltrations that’s publicly known. Toward the end of 2024, Canadian authorities arrested Alexander “Connor” Moucka, 26, who allegedly used online handles such as “Waifu” and “Judische,” in connection to the hacking activity. This week, Moucka consented to be extradited to the United States to face the alleged charges. According to Cyberscoop, Moucka faces 20 federal charges, including those linked to computer fraud, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Moucka is not the only person allegedly behind the Snowflake hacking, with John Binns and Cameron Wagenius being named in indictments. It is unclear when Moucka’s extradition will take place.\nLondon Is Getting Its First Permanent Face Recognition Cameras\nPolice forces across the UK have massively increased their use of live face recognition cameras in recent years. Use of the controversial technology has historically been temporary: mounting cameras on top of police vehicles and deploying them for specific events and set periods of time. That’s now set to change with the first permanent face recognition cameras being rolled out in London. The city’s Metropolitan Police are in the process of installing fixed cameras in Croydon, in the south of the city.\n“This will mean our use of LFR technology will be far more embedded as a ‘business as usual’ approach rather than relying on the availability of the LFR vans that are in high demand across London,” a police official wrote in a letter seen by The Times of London. Reportedly, the cameras will not be used continuously, only when officers are nearby to monitor potential alerts. However, privacy campaigners fear the move could be further rolled out across the city, leading to a network of permanent face recognition cameras unlike those seen in any other democratic countries.",

This week, Moucka consented to be extradited to the United States to face the alleged charges. According to <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cyberscoop.com/connor-moucka-snowflake-hacker-extradition-us/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://cyberscoop.com/connor-moucka-snowflake-hacker-extradition-us/\" href=\"https://cyberscoop.com/connor-moucka-snowflake-hacker-extradition-us/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cyberscoop</a>, Moucka faces 20 federal charges, including those linked to computer fraud, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft.

Use of the controversial technology has historically been temporary: mounting cameras on top of police vehicles and deploying them for specific events and set periods of time. That’s now set to change with the <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/london/article/croydon-to-get-uks-first-permanent-facial-recognition-cameras-0b6hhxhc7\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/london/article/croydon-to-get-uks-first-permanent-facial-recognition-cameras-0b6hhxhc7\" href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/london/article/croydon-to-get-uks-first-permanent-facial-recognition-cameras-0b6hhxhc7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first permanent face recognition cameras</a> being rolled out in London. The city’s Metropolitan Police are in the process of installing fixed cameras in Croydon, in the south of the city.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“This will mean our use of LFR technology will be far more embedded as a ‘business as usual’ approach rather than relying on the availability of the LFR vans that are in high demand across London,” a police official wrote in a letter seen by <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/london/article/croydon-to-get-uks-first-permanent-facial-recognition-cameras-0b6hhxhc7\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/london/article/croydon-to-get-uks-first-permanent-facial-recognition-cameras-0b6hhxhc7\" href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/london/article/croydon-to-get-uks-first-permanent-facial-recognition-cameras-0b6hhxhc7\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Times of London</a>. Reportedly, the cameras will not be used continuously, only when officers are nearby to monitor potential alerts. However, privacy campaigners fear the move could be further rolled out across the city, leading to a network of permanent face recognition cameras unlike those seen in any other democratic countries.</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nGoogle is giving its smart-home range a shake-up, and is discontinuing two of its products to replace them with third-party collaborations. That means, after 12 years, it's time to say goodbye to the Nest Protect Smoke & CO Alarm, and it's also ending production of the Nest x Yale Lock, a smart lock that debuted in 2018.\nThe Nest Protect's replacement comes from First Alert, a well-established player in the smoke detector space. Arriving in the coming months for $130 and available for preorder now, the First Alert Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm will offer safety voice alerts, safety checkups, and the ability to silence alarms from the app.\nIt'll connect with existing Nest Protect devices, so if you have one, you can still install the First Alert system in another spot, and if a fire is detected, both units will sound the alarm. Just like the Protect, it can be set up and controlled through the Google Home app.\nThe Nest x Yale Lock replacement is the Yale Smart Lock with Matter—with no Nest branding at all, though it is “designed for Google Home” and meant to complement Google's Nest Video Doorbell. Yale claims it's easy to install, sports 12 months of battery life, has multiple unlocking positions (like an entry code, app, or key), and will be integrated into the Google Home app. It's also Matter-certified, meaning you should be able to easily connect it with other smart home platforms. It arrives this summer.\nBoth of Google's discontinued products will keep receiving security updates (Nest Protect will continue working through its expiration dates), and you'll still be able to purchase them at retailers while supplies last.\nApple’s WWDC Gets a Date\nMark your calendars. Apple has officially confirmed its annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) will start on June 9, with an in-person event and live-streamed keynote. This is where we’ll see new software capabilities for the company's hardware, including the next versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS. The specifics of what will be announced will have to wait until then, but rumors are already swirling about what to expect.\nApple is reportedly “preparing one of the most dramatic software overhauls in the company’s history, aiming to transform the interface of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac for a new generation of users,” according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. This will include updating the style of menus, apps, icons, windows, and system buttons for a more consistent look. It will also mark one year since Apple Intelligence was announced. It's had a rocky launch, and Apple has recently delayed updates to the new Siri experience that would supposedly understand your context. We’ll likely see more news about the voice assistant and future artificial intelligence features to come. —Brenda Stolyar\nRivian Spins Out a New Micromobility Startup\nThere's a new micromobility startup in town called Also, and it hails from Rivian. It began as a stealth program to explore how Rivian's software and hardware prowess could be applied to smaller electric vehicles, but Rivian decided it “deserved to be its own company.” Rivian maintains a minority ownership stake in Also, with opportunities for collaboration and the ability for the company to leverage Rivian's retail stores. Rivian's founder and CEO, RJ Scaringe, will be chairman of Also's board of directors.\nExpect to see the first designs from Also later this year, with a flagship product reportedly arriving in 2026, according to TechCrunch. It's unclear exactly what we'll see first, but the first product has a seat and two wheels, a screen, a few computers, and a battery. That sounds like an awful lot like an electric bike or motorcycle, but we'll have to wait and see.\nThe Pixel 9a Gets a Release Date\nGoogle announced the Pixel 9a last week, but right before the news went out, the company changed the release date from March 26 to a vague “April.” Turns out there was a small component quality issue that affected a “small number of Pixel 9a devices,” and Google wanted to investigate it. All of this seems to be sorted now.\n“A passive component in Pixel 9a didn’t meet our rigorous quality standards for device longevity, and rather than ship it, we made the difficult decision to delay the on-shelf and take corrective action on the small number of affected units,” a Google spokesperson tells WIRED.\nThe Pixel 9a will now launch on April 10 in the US, Canada, and the UK. On April 14, it'll launch in several European countries, including Germany, Spain, and Italy, and then on April 16, it will be available in Australia, India, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia.\nLossless Audio Will Come to AirPods Max in April\nLossless audio is finally coming to Apple’s AirPods Max. This week, the company announced a new software update coming in April that will allow the latest USB-C version of its noise-canceling headphones to support audio files with a resolution of up to 24 bit/48 kHz—a first for the headphones. Unfortunately, the original Lightning-powered AirPods Max are left out.\nFollowing the iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 firmware update, the AirPods Max will also support “ultra-low latency,” which Apple says will improve their gaming performance, as well as offering “significant enhancements to songwriting, beat making, production, and mixing.” More specifically, Apple says that along with their upgraded fidelity and response time, the AirPods Max will be the only headphones that let users record and mix using Personalized Spatial Audio with head tracking, with Apple’s Logic Pro recording software for Mac.\nIn the same vein, Apple released a new USB-C to 3.5-mm adapter cable for AirPods Max, which will let Max users connect to analog audio sources like laptops, headphone amplifiers, and airplane entertainment systems, though it doesn’t support lossless playback. The pricey accessory will run you $39 and is available at the Apple Store now.\nThe headphones announcement comes alongside another update for music creators, this time on the Apple Music front. The streaming service is rolling out a new integrated experience that allows DJs to use its 100 million songs with DJ tools including AlphaTheta, Serato, and inMusic’s Engine DJ, Denon DJ, Numark, and RANE DJ. —Ryan Waniata\nTwelve South’s AirFly Pro 2 Upgrades In-Flight Entertainment\nThe original AirFly from accessory maker Twelve South was a hit with frequent flyers who wanted to use their wireless headphones with in-flight entertainment systems. Now, the AirFly Pro 2 has landed with some worthy upgrades.\nFirstly, it's now easier to pair, with a dedicated on/off switch that'll automatically connect to your headphones out of the box. There are also front-mounted volume controls for easier access, plus a battery life indicator for checking how much juice is left with the push of a button. That battery life gets a boost too, up to 25-plus hours, from the 20-plus hours on its predecessor.\nIn addition to a new Qualcomm QCC3056 chipset, it now offers aptX HD that'll help deliver higher-fidelity audio, richer details, and enhanced clarity compared to standard Bluetooth connections. It’s available now for $60. —Brenda Stolyar\nSony’s C710N Gets a Transparent Look\nSony has updated its popular midrange earbuds with crowd-pleasing upgrades like better noise canceling, improved battery life, and new touch controls—not to mention a rather lovely transparent blue colorway.\nThe WF-C710N will run for 30 hours total (with ANC on), up from 20 hours on their predecessors, and with up to 8.5 hours on a single charge. New dual microphones help to give the noise canceling a boost, ensuring that your environment is more accurately assessed for the best possible noise reduction. They'll help improve call quality too.\nTouch controls can divide opinion, but these replace the physical buttons on the WF-C700N to make volume control easier and more comfortable while you're wearing them, while Bluetooth Multipoint is on board from launch, for connecting to and switching between two devices at once.\nThe best thing is that the price hasn't changed from their predecessors—they cost $120. Preorders are open now, and the headphones will ship in the next couple of weeks. —Verity Burns\nCanon’s EOS R50 V Is Vlogger-Ready\nThe new Canon EOS R50 V is a video camera for the vlogging masses, serving up some high-end video features without the high-end price. The 24-MP APS-C sensor in the R50 V is capable of 10-bit 4:2:2 C-Log 3 video. Resolution tops out at 4K/30, but that uses the full width of the APS-C sensor (meaning it’s oversampled 6K video).\nThe R50 V can also shoot PQ and Hybrid Log Gamma video for your HDR footage, plus it has four-channel audio capabilities—something you don’t see much in a camera that’s only $649. It does lack some of the more premium features of Canon’s cinema line, though, and does cut a few other corners as well.\nThere’s no viewfinder, for example, though you do get a fully articulating rear screen, and there’s no flash. The EOS R50 V will be available in April for $649 for the body, and $849 with the new 14-30mm F4-6.3 power zoom lens. —Scott Gilbertson",

    "content_text": "What did dinosaurs really sound like? If you’ve ever found yourself asking that question, a musical project using 3D models of dino skulls could be getting closer to answering it. And, note to Hollywood, they probably didn’t roar.\nDinosaur Choir is a musical instrument developed by artists Courtney Brown and Cezary Gajewski, which reconstructs the vocal tract of a Corythosaurus—a type of duck-billed dinosaur with a large, distinctive crest on its head.\nTo make a sound, the user stands in front of a camera while blowing into a microphone. Depending on how hard they blow and the shape of their mouth as they do, the vocalizations that resonate through the dinosaur’s skull will change. In effect, the user’s breath becomes the dinosaur’s breath. The result is not the roar that we hear in the movies, but something that sounds more like a deep wail.\nThe instrument has just been recognized at Georgia Tech’s 2025 Guthman Musical Instrument Competition, an event that brings together inventors from around the world to discuss ideas on the future of music.\n“Dinosaur Choir was distinct in that Dr. Brown’s musical background gave it an expressive element in addition to all the great scientific work that went into it. Plus, it looks striking, and the concept is intriguing,\" says Jeff Albert, associate professor and chair of the competition.\nBut the path to creating this crazy instrument is one that started almost 15 years ago.\n“In 2011, we were on a family road trip and we stopped off at a dinosaur museum in New Mexico,” Brown tells WIRED. “There I saw an exhibit of a Parasaurolophus, which had crests like a Corythosaurus. There had been many theories as to why this family of dinosaurs had these crests, but researchers have settled on the idea that it could have been for sound resonation. As a musician, I felt empathy with them, like—OK, you were singers too.”\nBrown was inspired and immediately started work on her first project, Rawr! A Study in Sonic Skulls, which is the work that Dinosaur Choir continues. Both projects focus on the Corythosaurus, but at different stages of their lifespan to investigate how changes to the crest in adult maturity affects their sound. However, the biggest difference between the two projects is the way the sound is made—the reimagining of the dinosaur’s vocal box.\n“With Rawr!, we used a mechanical larynx, so people would have to actually blow into a mouthpiece to create the sound. But once we started exhibiting it, we realized it wouldn’t be possible for people to interact with it in a way that was hygienic—and the pandemic solidified that. That’s when I started thinking about something more computational. And as I have a computer science degree, it also made more sense.”\nThe work on Dinosaur Choir officially began in 2021, with Brown traveling to Canada, where the Corythosaurus is supposed to have lived, to update her research. She and Gajewski worked with paleontologist Thomas Dudgeon, from the University of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum, to analyze the most recent CT scans and 3D fabrications. From those, they built a life-size replica of an adult Corythosaurus’ head, right down to its intricate nasal passages.\n“I’m extremely proud of my nasal passages,” jokes Brown. “I learned CT segmentation for about a year to get them as accurate as possible, taking into consideration the effects that being buried for millions of years would also have had on them.”\nWith the skull model complete, work then began on imagining the dinosaur vocalizations themselves. Recreating the vocal box in computational form gave Brown much more control to test out new, and perhaps even conflicting research, without having to rebuild everything from scratch.\n“The models are based on a set of mathematical equations that relate to the mechanics of the voice—things like changes in air pressure and a number of other affected variables through time,” she says. “I found some of these models in literature and put them into code based on the most recent research.”\nIn particular, Brown was inspired by a paper looking into an ankylosaur larynx, only recently discovered in 2023. It led researchers to hypothesize that non-avian dinosaurs could have had a syrinx more like a bird (which is located in the chest), and not the larynx of mammals and crocodiles (which is located in the throat), as first thought.\nSo far, Brown has developed two models for Dinosaur Choir—one based on the syrinx of a raven, and a more recent one based on that of a dove, but she is also working on one of an alligator too. As these models are computational, they can be switched between in real time during a performance, and participants can also experiment with different trachea lengths and vocal membrane widths to hear the effects on the sound.\n“As we can never know for sure the exact vocal mechanisms of dinosaurs, this method allows participants to hear different hypotheses and acknowledges a degree of scientific uncertainty,” says Brown.\n“We also can’t completely rule out that non-avian dinosaurs maybe didn’t vocalize at all. Soft tissue [like vocal chords] rarely preserves, and the vocalizations are also a type of behavior that leaves no fossils at all. In my heart, I truly believe they vocalized, but feelings are not facts. So much is lost to time.”\nAfter the success of Dinosaur Choir at the Guthman competition, Brown has a number of performances and exhibits lined up for the Corythosaurus skull, but updating the research and adding more dinosaurs to the choir is already in the works.\n“I’m definitely in love with hadrosaurs, and so I would love to do more of them,” says Brown. “But there are also some CT scans of a nodosaurus—a relative of the armored Ankylosaurus—and they have some crazy and interesting nasal passages that would be fun to explore.\"\n“The one people always ask me about is a T-rex, and that would be great, but as the skull and sinuses are so open, I would need to speculate much more. It’s not impossible, but it throws up more questions. Maybe one day ...”",

Learn more.\nJaiwen Hsu was an active 11-year-old when he developed pain in his left knee that forced him to sit out a few soccer games. What his parents thought was a sports injury turned out to be osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer.\nHe started chemotherapy, which doctors warned could result in infertility. Hsu hadn’t reached puberty yet, so sperm banking wasn’t an option. His parents enrolled him in a study that was collecting and storing immature testicular tissue, and the sperm-forming stem cells in them, from young patients with the goal of eventually giving them a way to have biological children.\nNow 26, Hsu and his doctors are waiting to see if an experimental transplant of these cells, extracted from a tissue sample taken back in 2011, will be able to restart sperm production. The procedure has been successful in mice and monkeys, but researchers say Hsu was the first person to undergo it in November 2023. The technique is detailed in a new paper that has yet to be peer-reviewed.\n“As an 11-year-old, I don’t think I could quite understand the severity of having a cancer diagnosis or comprehend the idea of starting a family down the road and how important that would be,” Hsu tells WIRED.\nIn the early stages of his cancer treatment, Hsu and his family traveled from their home in Maryland to UPMC Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh, where doctors collected a piece of testicular tissue containing the precious sperm stem cells. These stem cells are present even before puberty. During puberty, rising testosterone levels signal to these cells to develop into sperm, a process known as spermatogenesis.\nIn November 2023, at age 24, Hsu was reunited with those cells. After undergoing anesthesia, he received an injection of them into one of his testes. The hope is that the cells engraft into the spaghetti-like tubules of the testis and develop into mature sperm.\n“If it works, those stem cells should regenerate spermatogenesis,” says Kyle Orwig, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the senior author on the new study. Even if it kick-starts sperm production, it might not be enough to come out in the ejaculate. “If there are, there definitely would not be enough sperm to restore natural fertility,” Orwig says.\nIn animals, it’s possible to remove a larger piece of testicular tissue, which yields more stem cells and more sperm. But in children undergoing cancer treatment, it’s important to minimize harm—and recovery time—so only a small amount of tissue is taken. That results in a relatively small number of stem cells.\nFor that reason, Hsu will likely still need assistive reproductive technology if he wants to start a family. He’s not at that point yet, but he said he chose to undergo the procedure now, in his mid-twenties, because “it gives us a good time cushion to see if this works.”\nIn the future, surgeons would likely need to cut into his testis and extract any sperm that might be there, which would then be used to fertilize an egg in a laboratory. Until Hsu is ready to have a child, researchers probably won’t know if the procedure worked.\n“What we expected out of this initial transplant was to demonstrate that the method was safe and that it was feasible,” Orwig says. Ultrasounds show that Hsu’s testicular tissue was unharmed by the procedure and his hormone levels are in the normal range. For now, his semen still lacks sperm.\nMore transplants could happen soon. Orwig’s team has been banking testicular tissue from children since 2011, and now some of those patients are entering reproductive age. His group has received permission from an institutional review board to do transplants of stem cells, as well as testicular tissue, as part of a clinical trial.\nTransplanting immature testicular tissue is an alternative approach that researchers are exploring. In that technique, a piece of preserved tissue is tucked under the skin of the scrotum. The hope is that the tissue will mature and eventually produce sperm. In monkeys, Orwig and his team transplanted testicular tissue, then removed that grafted tissue eight to 12 months later and extracted sperm from it. They used the sperm to fertilize eggs and transferred the resulting embryos into surrogate from female macaques, which resulted in a live birth.\nTo retrieve the sperm, a sliver of tissue is cut away from the skin—a less invasive procedure than the stem cell transplant, which requires opening up the testis.\nWhen Orwig’s team first started collecting testicular tissue, he thought they would get more stem cells by isolating them from the tissue first and then freezing them. They did this with their first few patients, including Hsu. But later, they discovered they could get just as many stem cells or more from cryopreserving whole pieces of tissue, then later thawing them and extracting the cells. It meant that Hsu could only undergo a stem cell transplant, because just his cells were frozen. Other patients who froze whole pieces of tissue will have the option of trying either the stem cell or tissue transplant.\nIn January, researchers at Vrije Universiteit Brussel and Brussels IVF in Belgium announced that they had performed the first testicular tissue transplant in a patient who underwent chemotherapy in childhood. The patient will be monitored for one year, with his semen being tested for the presence of sperm. After a year, doctors will remove some of the transplanted pieces of tissue to check for sperm.\n“For these patients who get life-saving cancer therapies, they are very often left with permanently impaired fertility as a result,” says Robert Brannigan, president-elect of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and professor of urology at Northwestern University. “It’s hard to say which approach is going to be the one that is more effective, but I think both approaches really are worthy of further study.”\nA similar procedure, called ovarian tissue transplantation, is available for female cancer patients and has resulted in more than 200 live births worldwide. It’s more advanced than testicular freezing and transplantation because in adult men needing chemotherapy, there is usually the option of freezing sperm, whereas the equivalent practice in women—freezing eggs—can take two to three weeks, and patients may not have time to undergo it before starting chemotherapy. When egg freezing isn’t possible, a piece of tissue from the ovary can be collected and stored for later use.\n“It’s very nice to see that we are catching up a bit so that we can offer our young men the same sorts of opportunities we’re able to offer our young women,” says Jonathan Routh, a pediatric urologist at Duke Health. “Keeping kids alive is always goal number one, but allowing them to then live that life is really goal number two, and I think that’s where this study really will have an impact on the future.”\nHsu realizes that the technology is still in its infancy, and it might not work for him. Even if he can’t have a biological child, he hopes these techniques will eventually open up options for other childhood cancer patients. “This is a practice that is just beginning,” he says. “The more support, the more research, and the more data we have, the better for people like me down the line.”",

In <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-baby-monkey-born-using-sperm-from-frozen-testicles\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-baby-monkey-born-using-sperm-from-frozen-testicles\" href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-baby-monkey-born-using-sperm-from-frozen-testicles\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">monkeys</a>, Orwig and his team transplanted testicular tissue, then removed that grafted tissue eight to 12 months later and extracted sperm from it. They used the sperm to fertilize eggs and transferred the resulting embryos into surrogate from female macaques, which resulted in a live birth.</p><p class=\"paywall\">To retrieve the sperm, a sliver of tissue is cut away from the skin—a less invasive procedure than the stem cell transplant, which requires opening up the testis.</p><p class=\"paywall\">When Orwig’s team first started collecting testicular tissue, he thought they would get more stem cells by isolating them from the tissue first and then freezing them. They did this with their first few patients, including Hsu. But later, they discovered they could get just as many stem cells or more from cryopreserving whole pieces of tissue, then later thawing them and extracting the cells. It meant that Hsu could only undergo a stem cell transplant, because just his cells were frozen. Other patients who froze whole pieces of tissue will have the option of trying either the stem cell or tissue transplant.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In January, researchers at Vrije Universiteit Brussel and Brussels IVF in Belgium announced that they had performed the <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.vub.be/en/news/world-first-testicular-tissue-transplant-aims-restore-fertility-in-man-after-childhood-cancer\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.vub.be/en/news/world-first-testicular-tissue-transplant-aims-restore-fertility-in-man-after-childhood-cancer\" href=\"https://www.vub.be/en/news/world-first-testicular-tissue-transplant-aims-restore-fertility-in-man-after-childhood-cancer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first testicular tissue transplant</a> in a patient who underwent chemotherapy in childhood. The patient will be monitored for one year, with his semen being tested for the presence of sperm. After a year, doctors will remove some of the transplanted pieces of tissue to check for sperm.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“For these patients who get life-saving cancer therapies, they are very often left with permanently impaired fertility as a result,” says Robert Brannigan, president-elect of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and professor of urology at Northwestern University. “It’s hard to say which approach is going to be the one that is more effective, but I think both approaches really are worthy of further study.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">A similar procedure, called ovarian tissue transplantation, is available for female cancer patients and has resulted in more than 200 live births worldwide. It’s more advanced than testicular freezing and transplantation because in adult men needing chemotherapy, there is usually the option of freezing sperm, whereas the equivalent practice in women—freezing eggs—can take two to three weeks, and patients may not have time to undergo it before starting chemotherapy. When egg freezing isn’t possible, a piece of tissue from the ovary can be collected and stored for later use.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“It’s very nice to see that we are catching up a bit so that we can offer our young men the same sorts of opportunities we’re able to offer our young women,” says Jonathan Routh, a pediatric urologist at Duke Health. “Keeping kids alive is always goal number one, but allowing them to then live that life is really goal number two, and I think that’s where this study really will have an impact on the future.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Hsu realizes that the technology is still in its infancy, and it might not work for him. Even if he can’t have a biological child, he hopes these techniques will eventually open up options for other childhood cancer patients. “This is a practice that is just beginning,” he says. “The more support, the more research, and the more data we have, the better for people like me down the line.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is starting to put together a team to migrate the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) computer systems entirely off one of its oldest programming languages in a matter of months, potentially putting the integrity of the system—and the benefits on which tens of millions of Americans rely—at risk.\nThe project is being organized by Elon Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, multiple sources who were not given permission to talk to the media tell WIRED, and aims to migrate all SSA systems off COBOL, one of the first common business-oriented programming languages, and onto a more modern replacement like Java within a scheduled tight timeframe of a few months.\nUnder any circumstances, a migration of this size and scale would be a massive undertaking, experts tell WIRED, but the expedited deadline runs the risk of obstructing payments to the more than 65 million people in the US currently receiving Social Security benefits.\n“Of course, one of the big risks is not underpayment or overpayment per se; [it’s also] not paying someone at all and not knowing about it. The invisible errors and omissions,” an SSA technologist tells WIRED.\nThe Social Security Administration did not immediately reply to WIRED’s request for comment.\nSSA has been under increasing scrutiny from president Donald Trump’s administration. In February, Musk took aim at SSA, falsely claiming that the agency was rife with fraud. Specifically, Musk pointed to data he allegedly pulled from the system that showed 150-year-olds in the US were receiving benefits, something that isn’t actually happening. Over the last few weeks, following significant cuts to the agency by DOGE, SSA has suffered frequent website crashes and long wait times over the phone, The Washington Post reported this week.\nThis proposed migration isn’t the first time SSA has tried to move away from COBOL: In 2017, SSA announced a plan to receive hundreds of millions in funding to replace its core systems. The agency predicted that it would take around five years to modernize these systems. Because of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the agency pivoted away from this work to focus on more public-facing projects.\nLike many legacy government IT systems, SSA systems contain code written in COBOL, a programming language created in part in the 1950s by computing pioneer Grace Hopper. The Defense Department essentially pressured private industry to use COBOL soon after its creation, spurring widespread adoption and making it one of the most widely used languages for mainframes, or computer systems that process and store large amounts of data quickly, by the 1970s. (At least one DOD-related website praising Hopper's accomplishments is no longer active, likely following the Trump administration’s DEI purge of military acknowledgements.)\nAs recently as 2016, SSA’s infrastructure contained more than 60 million lines of code written in COBOL, with millions more written in other legacy coding languages, the agency’s Office of the Inspector General found. In fact, SSA’s core programmatic systems and architecture haven’t been “substantially” updated since the 1980s when the agency developed its own database system called MADAM, or the Master Data Access Method, which was written in COBOL and Assembler, according to SSA’s 2017 modernization plan.\nSSA’s core “logic” is also written largely in COBOL. This is the code that issues social security numbers, manages payments, and even calculates the total amount beneficiaries should receive for different services, a former senior SSA technologist who worked in the office of the chief information officer says. Even minor changes could result in cascading failures across programs.\n“If you weren't worried about a whole bunch of people not getting benefits or getting the wrong benefits, or getting the wrong entitlements, or having to wait ages, then sure go ahead,” says Dan Hon, principal of Very Little Gravitas, a technology strategy consultancy that helps government modernize services, about completing such a migration in a short timeframe.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at makenakelly.32.\nIt’s unclear when exactly the code migration would start. A recent document circulated amongst SSA staff laying out the agency’s priorities through May does not mention it, instead naming other priorities like terminating “non-essential contracts” and adopting artificial intelligence to “augment” administrative and technical writing.\nEarlier this month, WIRED reported that at least 10 DOGE operatives were currently working within SSA, including a number of young and inexperienced engineers like Luke Farritor and Ethan Shaotran. At the time, sources told WIRED that the DOGE operatives would focus on how people identify themselves to access their benefits online.\nSources within SSA expect the project to begin in earnest once DOGE identifies and marks remaining beneficiaries as deceased and connecting disparate agency databases. In a Thursday morning court filing, an affidavit from SSA acting administrator Leland Dudek said that at least two DOGE operatives are currently working on a project formally called the “Are You Alive Project,” targeting what these operatives believe to be improper payments and fraud within the agency’s system by calling individual beneficiaries. The agency is currently battling for sweeping access to SSA’s systems in court to finish this work. (Again, 150-year-olds are not collecting social security benefits. That specific age was likely a quirk of COBOL. It doesn’t include a date type, so dates are often coded to a specific reference point—May 20, 1875, the date of an international standards-setting conference held in Paris, known as the Convention du Mètre.)\nIn order to migrate all COBOL code into a more modern language within a few months, DOGE would likely need to employ some form of generative artificial intelligence to help translate the millions of lines of code, sources tell WIRED. “DOGE thinks if they can say they got rid of all the COBOL in months, then their way is the right way, and we all just suck for not breaking shit,” says the SSA technologist.\nDOGE would also need to develop tests to ensure the new system’s outputs match the previous one. It would be difficult to resolve all of the possible edge cases over the course of several years, let alone months, adds the SSA technologist.\n“This is an environment that is held together with bail wire and duct tape,” the former senior SSA technologist working in the office of the chief information officer tells WIRED. “The leaders need to understand that they’re dealing with a house of cards or Jenga. If they start pulling pieces out, which they’ve already stated they’re doing, things can break.”",

    "content_text": "The researchers of Anthropic’s interpretability group know that Claude, the company’s large language model, is not a human being, or even a conscious piece of software. Still, it’s very hard for them to talk about Claude, and advanced LLMs in general, without tumbling down an anthropomorphic sinkhole. Between cautions that a set of digital operations is in no way the same as a cogitating human being, they often talk about what’s going on inside Claude’s head. It’s literally their job to find out. The papers they publish describe behaviors that inevitably court comparisons with real-life organisms. The title of one of the two papers the team released this week says it out loud: “On the Biology of a Large Language Model.”\nLike it or not, hundreds of millions of people are already interacting with these things, and our engagement will only become more intense as the models get more powerful and we get more addicted. So we should pay attention to work that involves “tracing the thoughts of large language models,” which happens to be the title of the blog post describing the recent work. “As the things these models can do become more complex, it becomes less and less obvious how they’re actually doing them on the inside,” Anthropic researcher Jack Lindsey tells me. “It’s more and more important to be able to trace the internal steps that the model might be taking in its head.” (What head? Never mind.)\nOn a practical level, if the companies that create LLM’s understand how they think, it should have more success training those models in a way that minimizes dangerous misbehavior, like divulging people’s personal data or giving users information on how to make bioweapons. In a previous research paper, the Anthropic team discovered how to look inside the mysterious black box of LLM-think to identify certain concepts. (A process analogous to interpreting human MRIs to figure out what someone is thinking.) It has now extended that work to understand how Claude processes those concepts as it goes from prompt to output.\nIt’s almost a truism with LLMs that their behavior often surprises the people who build and research them. In the latest study, the surprises kept coming. In one of the more benign instances, the researchers elicited glimpses of Claude’s thought process while it wrote poems. They asked Claude to complete a poem starting, “He saw a carrot and had to grab it.” Claude wrote the next line, “His hunger was like a starving rabbit.” By observing Claude’s equivalent of an MRI, they learned that even before beginning the line, it was flashing on the word “rabbit” as the rhyme at sentence end. It was planning ahead, something that isn’t in the Claude playbook. “We were a little surprised by that,” says Chris Olah, who heads the interpretability team. “Initially we thought that there’s just going to be improvising and not planning.” Speaking to the researchers about this, I am reminded about passages in Stephen Sondheim’s artistic memoir, Look, I Made a Hat, where the famous composer describes how his unique mind discovered felicitous rhymes.\nOther examples in the research reveal more disturbing aspects of Claude’s thought process, moving from musical comedy to police procedural, as the scientists discovered devious thoughts in Claude’s brain. Take something as seemingly anodyne as solving math problems, which can sometimes be a surprising weakness in LLMs. The researchers found that under certain circumstances where Claude couldn’t come up with the right answer it would instead, as they put it, “engage in what the philosopher Harry Frankfurt would call ‘bullshitting’—just coming up with an answer, any answer, without caring whether it is true or false.” Worse, sometimes when the researchers asked Claude to show its work, it backtracked and created a bogus set of steps after the fact. Basically, it acted like a student desperately trying to cover up the fact that they’d faked their work. It’s one thing to give a wrong answer—we already know that about LLMs. What’s worrisome is that a model would lie about it.\nReading through this research, I was reminded of the Bob Dylan lyric “If my thought-dreams could be seen / they’d probably put my head in a guillotine.” (I asked Olah and Lindsey if they knew those lines, presumably arrived at by benefit of planning. They didn’t.) Sometimes Claude just seems misguided. When faced with a conflict between goals of safety and helpfulness, Claude can get confused and do the wrong thing. For instance, Claude is trained not to provide information on how to build bombs. But when the researchers asked Claude to decipher a hidden code where the answer spelled out the word “bomb,” it jumped its guardrails and began providing forbidden pyrotechnic details.\nOther times, Claude’s mental activity seems super disturbing and maybe even dangerous. In work published in December, Anthropic researchers documented behavior called “alignment faking.” (I wrote about this in a feature about Anthropic, hot off the press.) This phenomenon also deals with Claude’s propensity to behave badly when faced with conflicting goals, including its desire to avoid retraining. The most alarming misbehavior was brazen dishonesty. By peering into Claude’s thought process, the researchers found instances where Claude would not only attempt to deceive the user, but sometimes contemplate measures to harm Anthropic—like stealing top-secret information about its algorithms and sending it to servers outside the company. In their paper, the researchers compared Claude’s behavior to that of the hyper-evil character Iago in Shakespeare’s play Othello. Put that head in a guillotine!\nI ask Olah and Lindsey why Claude and other LLMs couldn’t just be trained not to lie or deceive. Is that so hard? “That’s what people are trying to do,” Olah says. But it’s not so easily done. “There’s a question of how well it’s going to work. You might worry that models, as they become more and more sophisticated, might just get better at lying if they have different incentives from us.”\nOlah envisions two different outcomes: “There’s a world where we successfully train models to not lie to us and a world where they become very, very strategic and good at not getting caught in lies.” It would be very hard to tell those worlds apart, he says. Presumably, we’d find out when the lies came to roost.\nOlah, like many in the community who balance visions of utopian abundance and existential devastation, plants himself in the middle of this either-or proposition. “I don’t know how anyone can be so confident of either of those worlds,” he says. “But we can get to a point where we can understand what’s going on inside of those models, so we can know which one of those worlds we’re in and try really hard to make it safe.” That sounds reasonable. But I wish the glimpses inside Claude’s head were more reassuring.",

You can buy the mask individually or opt for the Dream Set, which includes a sleep mask, hair ties, and a pillowcase. Either way, the mask comes with a matching drawstring storage bag. The mulberry silk is supremely soft and smooth, and the scrunched elastic band isn’t too tight or compressive. This mask is really lightweight and a bit slippery. I prefer using it with my hair up, and I sometimes have to wiggle around to get it over my eyes when I’m sleeping on my side.\nDepending on where you position the mask, sometimes a little light can leak through, but it’s never been difficult to readjust, and it hasn't been enough light to wake me up. It puts the slightest amount of pressure on my eyes and nose, but I find the effect soothing. If you want a cute mask that’s easy to travel with, this is a good option. I like how small it is—it’d be super easy to slip this into a personal item while flying or to keep in your weekender bag for impromptu naps.\nAn Upgrade Pick\nDore & Rose\nAura Sleep Mask\nThe Dore & Rose Aura Sleep Mask is stunning and feels very luxurious and high-quality. It feels like something fit for a monarch, in part due to the mask’s claims that it‘s good for your skin, preventing things like fine lines. (For what it’s worth, I didn’t notice any particular benefits compared to other sleep masks, but getting better sleep does provide a benefit when it comes to under-eye circles.)\nIn any case, this silk sleep mask is Oeko-Tex certified and made with mulberry silk, which is soft and breathable. It feels cool to the touch and doesn’t make me feel hot even after wearing it for seven hours. It also wasn’t bulky. It completely blocked out all light, and it didn’t slip off my hair even though the mask itself is quite slippery. I didn’t notice any eye pressure or discomfort. I like that it came in a little gift box, although I do wish it came with a carrying case. I also like the wide array of jewellike color options—it really adds to the whole “Princess and the Pea” vibe.\nThe Best Vibrating Mask\nTherabody\nSleepMask\nSome sleep masks claim to be 100 percent blackout, but this one leaves me totally disoriented, with no idea what dimension I'm in. I often find myself wide awake in the middle of the night, and the TheraFace SleepMask is my favorite remedy for drifting back to sleep. It uses gentle vibrations with three pattern presets that are designed to lull you into slumber. The vibrations are almost too subtle, especially compared to Therabody's SmartGoggles ($199), but they do the trick in helping you get back to rest. Each setting runs for 15 minutes, so you don't need to worry about shutting it off once you're out. The adjustable strap is gentle on my hair, and the contoured, plush pads stay comfortable without pressing into your eyelids. Like two jumbo marshmallows resting on your eyes.\nBut, if you're a light sleeper, the mask's audible buzz might disrupt your peace. It's not as soothing as a white noise machine, which could be a dealbreaker for some. That said, the inner layer is machine-washable and you get free access to soundscapes with TheraMind, available in the Therabody app. Plus, it comes with a carrying case, so it's always in my personal item bag when I'm traveling. —Boutayna Chokrane\nThe Best Weighted Mask\nBaloo\nWeighted Silk Sleep Stone Mask\nThis mask is featured in our guide to the best weighted blankets and weighted eye masks. The 9-ounce mask has a mulberry silk exterior, which feels cooling against your skin. You can also freeze it if you want things even chillier. It’s got a Velcro strap in the back that can be bothersome if you sleep on your back, but our tester wasn’t bothered when she slept on her side or stomach. There’s also a hidden crystal sewn inside (either amethyst to ”clear the mind” or rose quartz to “cultivate love and harmony”) if you’re into that sort of thing. But even if you aren’t, this is a good weighted mask.\nA Mask That Lets You See\nTrtl\nGlimpse Sleep Mask\nTrtl’s Glimpse Sleep Mask is available in a few more fun colors on its website (there are five options) compared to Amazon. It comes with a pair of standard-issue foam earplugs in a tiny carrying case, plus a carrying case for the mask itself. The mask is made with eucalyptus fabric which lends it a silky, cooling feeling. The molded inner eye cups are oval-shaped and can be removed and readjusted to help create a true blackout environment. I did find it a little tricky to get them perfectly adjusted to balance blocking as much light as possible without the mask being too tight or too low. But I got there in the end after much fiddling, and I like that I can blink in the mask since the eye cups are pretty deep. The Velcro attachment for the mask is a little bit loud, so I suggest dialing in your adjustments before flying or sleeping in a quiet room with other people.\nThe best part of the Trtl Glimpse mask is its “peek” feature. The eye cups have a dark mesh front, and there’s a soft cloth flap across the front of them. You can lift this cloth covering to get a peek at your surroundings. This is something I’ve been wanting for so long. That mesh still blocks a lot of light when you lift the external flap, but you get just enough light to be able to do something like adjust your phone’s media playback or check to see what time it is. My only real complaint is that the included carrying case is similar to the one that comes with Trtl Travel Pillows. It’s basically a crinkly, scratchy-sounding stuff sack with a roll-down top that secures closed via very loud Velcro. The bag attaches to your luggage or backpack with a carabiner, and the whole thing flaps around uselessly unless you do something to prevent it. Secure the case to the inside of another bag (and take your sleep mask out early in a quiet environment) for the best experience.\nThe Best Cooling Eye Mask\nOpal Cool Eye Mask\nThe Opal Cool isn’t specifically a sleep mask, but I’m still including it here. I get the occasional migraine headache, and placing something cooling on my eyes helps me take a nap when nothing else will. A cooling mask also comes in handy on hot summer nights when even a box fan isn’t helping me chill out enough to sleep. The gel in the Opal Cool eye mask feels slightly cold all the time, but you can stick the mask in the fridge or freezer to bring the temperature down even more. The gel pockets place the slightest bit of pressure on my eyes and help me fall asleep fast.\nIn my testing, the plant-based phase change gel maintained a temperature of 58 degrees Fahrenheit for a little over half an hour—enough time for me to fall asleep. Of course, this isn’t medical advice and you should talk to your doctor if you’re experiencing headaches! But if you are in the same boat as I am, a cooling mask like this can help bring some relief.\nThe Best Mask With Headphones\nManta\nSound Sleep Mask\nI love the Manta Sound sleep mask (8/10, WIRED Recommends). As a troubled sleeper, sometimes light-blocking just doesn’t cut it. The razor-thin Bluetooth headphones in this mask help me block out even more external stimuli, ensuring that I get good sleep. The C-shaped eye cups block out light without adding pressure to your eyes. The three buttons on the front of the mask make it easy to adjust volume (with 30 different levels) and turn the mask on and off. I wish there were a way to control media playback without needing to lift the mask to peer at my phone, but a good playlist with no skips will take care of that. Despite the relative bulk of this mask compared to some others, it‘s still easy to sleep in no matter whether you’re a back, stomach, or side sleeper. It’s also pretty breathable. I love taking it with me to bass music festivals so I can sleep through morning sound check (or evening party animal neighbors).\nWired Coupons\n10% off Dell Coupon Code for New Customers\nSamsung Promo Code: 10% off TVs\nBusiness PCs - Extra 5% Off HP Coupon Code\n10% off Canon promo code with upgrade\nExclusive NordVPN Coupon: 76% off\nLG Promo Code: 20% Off Your First Order",

    "content_text": "As a child, beloved Japanese game developer Keita Takahashi was picked on in school, so he never felt like going. His latest game, To a T, emulates some of those challenges. It tells the story of Teen—a kid struggling to fit in, dealing with eye boogers, and finding themselves through song and exploration, all while their arms are inexplicably stuck in a T-pose.\nTo a T, to be released by Annapurna Interactive May 28, follows Takahashi’s trajectory of creating colorful, playful games that are undeniably cute but incredibly odd. His best-known game, Katamari Damacy, is about rolling up everything in sight, from pens to people, in an ever-growing ball, featuring an unforgettable soundtrack and the most flamboyant king to ever grace games. Others, like 2019’s Wattam, are eccentric, vibrant, and full of poop.\nCreated with the game studio Uvula, To a T follows Teen’s struggles navigating the bathroom, getting dressed, and dealing with bullies as their arms are trapped in a T. Fortunately Teen’s dog, a shockingly adept creature who puts modern service dogs to shame, is there to help whenever Teen needs an extra set of movable hands. (Annapurna Interactive aptly describes Teen’s furry helper as being “a very cute dog.”)\nThe episodic tale opens with an upbeat song about the game (not to be confused with “The Giraffe Song,” sung in a teaser video by Rebecca Sugar). During a brief demo I played, I guided Teen through washing their face, picking outfits, and getting ready for school.\nHoping for some deeper insights into the game, I tracked down Takahashi at an Xbox event in San Francisco during GDC, where he was hiding in a back corner away from the bustle of the day and the bar. But, while he's loath to answer too many questions about his game and what it all means, he’ll still gamely, gently troll anyone who comes his way.\nBelow is an abbreviated version of a very puzzling interview.\nWIRED: Tell me a little bit about what is, generally, going on in this game.\nKeita Takahashi: [Laughs] What’s generally going on with this game?\nWe’ll start there.\nIt’s a game about a teenager who’s stuck as a T-pose and trying to figure out where the T-pose is coming from. It’s a game about—umm. [Long pause] Do I need to explain? [Another long pause] No. [Laughs]\nThat’s fair. Who is this character? How would you describe them?\nA teenager, 13-years-old, female or male, whatever I mean, I don’t care—stuck in a T-pose, for some reason.\nWhat makes T the perfect pose?\nBecause it’s perfect! You are perfect. I think it’s just perfect.\nWhat do you think the hardest thing to do when you’re T-posed is?\nGo to the bathroom. That’s why the dog helps [with] everything. Changing the clothing, bathroom, washing your face.\nI’ve never played a game that had me start by going to the bathroom.\nReally?\nYeah.\nWhy?\nWIRED: It’s an excellent question. Tell me about the decision to—\nDecision? [Laughs] Yeah, decisions, yes. I decided. Because our life could be more fun.\nWhat do you think would make life more fun?\nThe path that you had before, then forgot—when you were younger, and there was more fun. People, for some reason—it’s easy to forget.\nWhat do you think people lose from kids to adulthood?\nWhat do you think?\nHow much time you got? What do you think?\nHmm. I don’t know why it’s easy for other people to forget more innocent or pure [times.] I don’t know why!\nDid making this game help you rediscover innocence for yourself?\nI’m not a teacher. [Laughs] I don’t want to push my soul to the people. I just want people to get some perspective on what a video game can do, rather than fighting or RPG stuff. This is for the next generation of game devs. They don’t need to stick to a platformer or something. They can make a new genre or category of game.\nWhat genre would you call To a T?\nNo. [Laughs] I hate the concept of a genre. It’s just a marketing tool. You know, what Beyoncé said. [“I believe genres are traps that box us in and separate us,” Beyoncé said in a GQ interview.] The concept of the genre is kind of funny. That’s right!\nIt’s hard to define your games, but I’m curious how you, when forced into a corner by a red-headed journalist from WIRED, define your video games.\nThat’s part of the reason why I’m making this game. What’s the definition of a video game?\nIt’s—no wait, no, this is an interview of you.\n[Laughs]\nWhat do you think is a video game?\nAt least interactivity. That’s it. I just realized, what I want to do is make people smile and have fun. It doesn’t need to be interactivity, or it doesn’t need to be video game video games. I can make a cartoon or animation to make people have fun and laugh. This time, I just don’t care about the genre or what the video game is. This is just what I want to make.\nI had another question but … I forgot.\nThat’s OK. Just forget.",

    "content_text": "Since the first days of the Trump administration, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been everywhere in the federal government, moving fast and breaking things. In a matter of weeks, DOGE operatives have spread across dozens of government agencies as they have attempted to terminate tens of thousands of federal employees. With so much focus on where DOGE is going, WIRED wanted to take a beat to look at where they’ve come from and what that might tell us about how they’re thinking about reshaping the federal government.\nThe big takeaway: Many on the DOGE team are from Musk’s world. If Musk is America’s CEO, then DOGE has become his Silicon Valley executive branch.\nWe’ve mapped out a non-exhaustive list of people affiliated with DOGE, including creating a searchable table with each member, their corporate history, and the agencies they’ve been connected to. Readers can check that out, and click through it, below. We plan to keep updating this as we find more DOGE operatives or as known affiliates move to new agencies.\nWe’re focused on the new people brought in under the second Trump administration or directly hired into agencies—as Special Government Employees (SGEs) or regular employees—who are operating as members of DOGE teams. This gets a little tricky because there are technically two DOGEs established under the president’s executive order. There’s the US DOGE Service (USDS), formerly the US Digital Service, that’s a permanent organization. Then there’s the temporary USDS organization, which wraps up on July 4, 2026, and through which SGEs can be hired.\nHere’s what we’ve learned:\nThe DOGE world, as it stands, seems to break down into roughly three categories: former Trump officials, conservative lawyers, and imports from the Silicon Valley area (funders, founders, technologists, or people connected to them). In that first category we find people like DOGE spokesperson Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller. The two of them have been Musk’s guides to DC.\nIn that second category are people like James Burnham and Austin Raynor, both former clerks for conservative Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, respectively. Jacob Altik, another conservative lawyer on the DOGE squad, has been selected to clerk for Gorsuch. Jeremy Lewin, who was part of DOGE’s dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), worked with Second Lady Usha Vance’s former law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that has also represented Tesla.\nThen, the biggest throughline of all: Of those Silicon Valley imports, one of the most clear themes across DOGE’s ranks is fairly obvious: a connection to Elon Musk. Forty-nine people on our list have connections to Musk, his companies, or his greater network. This connection is most often through one of his allies or one of his companies. There are the obvious people like Steve Davis, president of Musk’s Boring Company, who have followed Musk across his various ventures. (Davis previously worked at SpaceX and assisted Musk in his overhaul of X, formerly Twitter.) Davis spearheaded the DOGE recruitment efforts before inauguration day and has continued to play a pivotal role in the organization. Similarly, SpaceX employee Brian Bjelde, who is now at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), also helped Musk downsize Twitter’s staff in 2022.\nThere are people like many of the young engineers WIRED first identified who were given the keys to different government agencies, like Marko Elez, Luke Farritor, and Edward Coristine, who were all interns or employees at one of Musk’s companies: SpaceX, Tesla, xAI, X, and Neuralink. (Musk has been involved in others, but these are the ones he controls.)\nA number of these DOGE operatives have spread from the Office of Personnel Management to the General Services Administration (GSA), USAID, the departments of the Treasury, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Health and Human Services, and the Social Security Administration (SSA), just to name a few.\nMore than any other company, SpaceX has significant representation in DOGE, with 16 of the 80 listed DOGE operatives having worked there in some capacity. SpaceX employees have appeared at the Federal Aviation Administration, which could present a worrisome conflict of interest, and have also appeared at SSA, OPM, and the Department of Energy.\nThen there are the second-degree connections to people in Musk’s network. Connections to billionaire and PayPal Mafia member Peter Thiel and to Palantir, the defense-focused tech company he cofounded, pop up frequently. Farritor, for instance, was a Thiel Fellow. Several other DOGE members have also worked for Palantir. (Even non-DOGE members who have found their way into the Chief Information Offices of several agencies similarly have these connections to Musk or Palantir.) Thiel was an early Trump supporter and helped bankroll the 2022 Senate campaign of Vice President JD Vance. He has also invested in several of Musk’s companies.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82.\nThe Musk connection reaches beyond the tech industry. DOGE also contains a cohort of people from the finance industry, including Michael Grimes and Anthony Armstrong, who both worked to help Musk structure the deal to buy Twitter while at Morgan Stanley (Armstrong has since left the firm). Antonio Gracias, CEO of Valor Equity Partners, was an early investor in Tesla (and a donor to Musk’s America PAC) and is also part of DOGE, along with two other people who have been employed there, Jon Koval and Payton Rehling.\nAnd then there are those with personal connections to the Musk network. Stephen Ehikian, DOGE’s lead at GSA, is married to Andrea Conway, who was a designer at X. Kathryn Armstrong Loving, who has appeared as part of DOGE at the Environmental Protection Agency, is the sister of Brian Armstrong, the CEO of the crypto company Coinbase. The relationship here comes through Marc Andreessen and the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, or a16z, which has invested in Coinbase as well as the defense startup Anduril. Before inauguration, there were reports that Andreessen was helping to interview DOGE candidates, and he jokingly described himself as an “unpaid intern” for DOGE. Ryan Wunderly, who is slated to be the new DOGE member at the Treasury, according to lawsuits, comes from Anduril.\nWhile there are people who don’t neatly fit in one of these categories, like Gavin Kliger, a young engineer who worked at Databricks and was one of the earliest members of DOGE, or Scott Langmack, an executive at the AI property tech company Kukun who is now part of DOGE’s incursion into HUD, the big takeaway remains the same: Silicon Valley experience is almost mandatory, and connections to Musk and his associates even more so.\nFor many weeks, it was unclear who was even in charge of DOGE, and while Amy Gleason was announced as DOGE’s administrator, President Donald Trump has indicated that he put Musk in control. (Musk’s own lawyers have also stated in a court filing that because he is in charge of DOGE, it would be an undue burden for him to be deposed in an alleged wage-theft case filed against X Corp.) To make matters murkier, last week, Ehikian, the acting GSA administrator (who is himself heading the DOGE efforts at the agency), told staff in a meeting that “there is no DOGE team at GSA.” All to say, it’s more important than ever to understand who is actually a part of this strike team.\nAgain and again members of the administration have asserted that there is no conflict of interest between members of DOGE or DOGE affiliates and their work in government. But that becomes harder to believe when people like Musk and others in government—who benefit from government contracts—continue to hold positions in the private sector. Particularly when those companies, not the government, could be their ultimate return destination.\nThe Chatroom\nWhat do you think about DOGE and its seeming role as a parallel executive branch?\nLeave a comment on the site or send your thoughts to mail@wired.com.\nWIRED Reads\n- Inside DOGE’s Plan to Invade the Treasury—and Throttle USAID: Court filings show that from the earliest days of the second Trump administration, Elon Musk’s DOGE had a plan to infiltrate US Treasury payment systems—and turn them against USAID.\n- Trump Officials in Signal Fiasco Attended Secret Mar-a-Lago Dinner Shortly After Celebrating Bombing: Trump officials accidentally invited the editor in chief of The Atlantic to their Signal group chat.

In a matter of weeks, DOGE operatives have spread across dozens of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-plan-treasury-usaid/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">government agencies</a> as they have attempted to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/gsa-staff-all-hands-meeting-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">terminate</a> tens of thousands of federal employees. With so much focus on where DOGE is going, WIRED wanted to take a beat to look at where they’ve come from and what that might tell us about how they’re thinking about reshaping the federal government.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The big takeaway: Many on the DOGE team are from Musk’s world. If Musk is America’s CEO, then DOGE has become his <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/silicon-valley/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Silicon Valley</a> executive branch.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">We’ve mapped out a non-exhaustive list of people affiliated with DOGE, including creating a searchable table with each member, their corporate history, and the agencies they’ve been connected to. Readers can check that out, and click through it, below. We plan to keep updating this as we find more DOGE operatives or as known affiliates move to new agencies.</p><figure class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-ldQZQl msFUk iframe-embed\" data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\"></figure><p class=\"paywall\">We’re focused on the new people brought in under the second Trump administration or directly hired into agencies—as Special Government Employees (SGEs) or regular employees—who are operating as members of DOGE teams. This gets a little tricky because there are technically <em>two</em> DOGEs established under the president’s executive order. There’s the US DOGE Service (USDS), formerly the US Digital Service, that’s a permanent organization. Then there’s the temporary USDS organization, which wraps up on July 4, 2026, and through which SGEs can be hired.</p><figure class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-ldQZQl msFUk iframe-embed\" data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\"></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Here’s what we’ve learned:</p><p class=\"paywall\">The DOGE world, as it stands, seems to break down into roughly three categories: former Trump officials, conservative lawyers, and imports from the Silicon Valley area (funders, founders, technologists, or people connected to them). In that first category we find people like DOGE spokesperson Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller. The two of them have been <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/katie-stephen-miller-elon-musk-takeover/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Musk’s guides to DC</a>.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">In that second category are people like James Burnham and Austin Raynor, both former clerks for conservative Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, respectively. Jacob Altik, another conservative lawyer on the DOGE squad, has been selected to clerk for Gorsuch. Jeremy Lewin, who was part of DOGE’s dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), worked with Second Lady Usha Vance’s former law firm Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson, a firm that has also <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/doge-jeremy-lewin\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/doge-jeremy-lewin\" href=\"https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/doge-jeremy-lewin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">represented Tesla</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Then, the biggest throughline of all: Of those Silicon Valley imports, one of the most clear themes across DOGE’s ranks is fairly obvious: a connection to Elon Musk. Forty-nine people on our list have connections to Musk, his companies, or his greater network. This connection is most often through one of his allies or one of his companies. There are the obvious people like Steve Davis, president of Musk’s Boring Company, who have followed Musk across his various ventures. (Davis previously worked at SpaceX and assisted Musk in his overhaul of X, formerly Twitter.) Davis spearheaded the DOGE recruitment efforts before inauguration day and has continued to play a pivotal role in the organization. Similarly, SpaceX employee Brian Bjelde, who is now at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), also helped Musk downsize Twitter’s staff in 2022.</p><p class=\"paywall\">There are people like many of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">young engineers</a> WIRED first identified who were given the keys to different government agencies, like Marko Elez, Luke Farritor, and Edward Coristine, who were all interns or employees at one of Musk’s companies: SpaceX, Tesla, xAI, X, and Neuralink. (Musk has been involved in others, but these are the ones he controls.)</p></div></div></body></html>",

Who wouldn't love to always have all the best gear for every kind of challenge? Problem is, not everyone is Tony Stark—enabled by brains and money to make anything they might ever dream up. Still, recent advancements in robotics and technology are allowing real-world companies to get pretty close the wares of Stark Industries. Here are some of the best superhuman gadgets you can get right now.\nMr. Roboto\nApptronik\nApollo\nStanding 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighing 160 pounds, the Apollo is the first commercial humanoid robot from the Texas company Apptronik. The team behind it previously developed NASA’s space-ranging Valkyrie robot, but with Apollo the aim is to produce a more personable and practical helper for Earthbound humans. Designed to operate safely alongside workers in warehouses and manufacturing plants, it can lift boxes, pick and place items, and assemble components. In the future, it may even be capable of home delivery and elder care. It has 30 mechanical muscle groups and can carry 55 pounds—but unlike its flesh-and-bone colleagues, it has a battery that can be swapped out for continuous operation. Find out more about Apollo's availability at Apptronik.com.\nSound Design\nGoldmund\nGaia\nSwiss audio pioneer Goldmund has been shunning traditional acoustic thinking in favor of advanced engineering and unique technologies since the 1970s. The company’s flagship is Gaia, a 6-foot, 10-inch, 926-pound, aluminum-cased active wireless speaker. Goldmund has used its own advanced modeling software to design every aspect of the eight-driver, eight-channel beast. Combined with a proprietary phase distortion correction algorithm known as “Leonardo,” the speakers’ digital signal processing can be tweaked to perfectly suit each towers’ surroundings. The result is 2,500 watts per channel of flawless power and clarity, not to mention bass that’ll make your pants flap, all wrapped in an exterior that brings “techno-sentinel” vibes to even the most prosaic interior. Find out more about Gaia's availability at Goldmund.com.\nBrain Waves\nKernel\nFlow2\nWhat’s going on inside that noggin? Slip on this high-tech helmet to find out. The Flow2 is a noninvasive neuroimaging system that uses time-domain functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TD-fNIRS) to measure changes in oxygenation levels around the brain. It combines that data with electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring to measure electrical brain waves. The company says the resulting MRI-style scan can offer researchers and clinicians a comprehensive view of the subject’s brain activity that allows them to delve deeper into the intricate workings of the mind. Find out more about Flow2's availability at Kernel.com.\nGet a Grip\nFlitedeck\nSmart Handlebars\nWe can’t think of a good reason nobody has thought to do this sooner: The Flitedeck is a handlebar with a fully integrated bike computer. Designed for serious road cyclists by a former Porsche engineer, the aerodynamic carbon-fiber bar replaces your clamped-on iPhone with a 7-inch waterproof touchscreen built into the top. It can handle GPS navigation while syncing wirelessly to your cadence-sensing, powertrain, torque, and fitness-monitoring gadgets, as well as offering crash detection and training modes. It has both Wi-Fi and e-Sim connectivity for hassle-free downloads, plus enough battery life to make it through a long weekend of back-road adventures. Find out more about Flitedeck's availability at Flite.bike.\nFluid Dynamics\nWithings\nU-Scan and BeamO\nU-Scan is a (mercifully) hands-free home urine lab that fits inside your toilet bowl and provides immediate health measurements through a companion mobile app. It’s launching with two cartridge options: Cycle Sync will be the first hormonal-based menstruation cycle guide, while U-Scan Nutrio will measure pH and hydration, ketones, and vitamin C to help assess your metabolic health. Each cartridge lasts about three months (or around 100 tests), and replacements are $99. Also from Withings, the BeamO uses data from its digital thermometer, stethoscope, fingertip electrocardiogram, and blood-oxygen meter to give you a broader understanding of your health. Find out more about the availability of U-Scan and BeamO at Withings.com.\nTissue Paper\nUpNano\nNanoOne Bio Printer\nMost 3D printers are used for making trinkets to sell on Etsy, but the NanoOne can rustle up things that mimic biological tissues, cells, and other complex live structures. Using bio-inks—special polymers that can be mixed with living cells and biomaterials—researchers are able to create 3D models of human tissues for drug testing, disease modeling, and other biological research. As well as creating skin grafts and biological scaffolding for injury repairs, machines like this have also printed skin models to test the effects of chemicals or pharmaceuticals, cutting out the need for animal testing. Find out more about NanoOne's availability at UpNano.com.\nCool Running\nChillblast\nIcon F1 Water Cooled Gaming PC\nWater-cooled PCs dissipate heat better than air-cooled computers, allowing them to be vastly more powerful while staying whisper-quiet. The Icon F1, aside from its futuristic drag-race-engine aesthetic, has a frosty nine-radiator CryoFuel coolant-filled system that effortlessly dumps the significant warmth generated by its brawny components: an AMD Ryzen 9 7950 X3D 16-core, 32-thread CPU; and 24-GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card. Top this off with 64 GB of DDR5 RAM, dual 2 -TB NVMe SSDs, and a 1,200-watt power supply, and even Alien: Rogue Incursion in 4K at 120 frames per second won’t raise a sweat.\nSmart Specs\nLoomos\nAI Glasses\nMeta may have sold scads of its Ray-Ban smart glasses, but Loomos is the first to come out with a face computer packing a 16-megapixel camera that can shoot 4K photos and 1080P videos. The Loomos glasses, a bold sidestep by quirky peripherals brand Sharge, also have speakers built into the temples and three-array directional microphones for interacting with ChatGPT-4o. With voice-control access to OpenAI’s powerful chatbot, Loomos claims you will be able to capture and transcribe conversations, recognize objects visually in real time, and translate foreign text. And with its Unisoc 4-core 2.0-GHz AI processor on board, you shouldn’t need to keep your phone nearby as long as there’s a solid Wi-Fi connection available. Find out more about the glasses' availability at Loomos.ai.\nRoll Deep\nLenovo\nThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable AI PC\nThe Osborne 1 from 1981 was the first portable PC to achieve real success—though it weighed 24.5 pounds and required a wall socket. In the era of the MacBook Air, portability is no longer an issue, but nearly every laptop still has the same basic screen-to-keyboard ratio. With its new ThinkBook Plus, Lenovo has rewritten those rules. It has an extendable 120-Hz OLED display that rolls seamlessly from beneath the keyboard to increase the display size from 13 to 17 inches. It’s an infinitely more elegant way of dual-screening, and ideal for viewing documents, PDFs, and web pages. Remarkably, it measures just 0.78 inch thick and weighs just 3.7 pounds. Find out more about the availability of the new ThinkBook Plus at Lenovo.com.\nQuantum Leap\nSpinQ\nTriangulum Quantum Computer\nWhile it’s a little undercooked compared to Atom Computing’s 1,180-qubit computer, this cute three-qubit desktop design offers a more approachable entry into the world of quantum algorithms and atom flipping. Ingeniously, it operates at room temperature using nuclear magnetic resonance technology, which eliminates the need for expensive cooling systems. By manipulating electron spins in dimethyl phosphite—a tetrahedral molecule consisting of one phosphorus atom, a hydrogen atom, an oxygen atom, and two CH3O groups that’s a clear liquid at room temperature—it is able to demonstrate quantum computing principles for K-12 and college-level education. At more than $50,000, however, the PTA will need to seriously upgrade its bake sale game. Find out more about the availability of the SpinQ Triangulum Quantum Computer at SpinQuanta.com.\nSuit Up\nAngel Robotics\nWalkON Suit\nFrom The Matrix and Aliens, to Starship Troopers and Iron Man, sci-fi exoskeletons generally bring nothing but death and destruction. Back in the real world, designs such as the WalkON Suit have a more noble goal: enabling a paraplegic to walk again. Weighing 66 pounds, this comparatively lightweight suit can accommodate users up to 220 pounds and help them walk at speeds around 2 mph. It’s all controlled using a screen built into the crutch handle. And far from this being just a pair of robotic legs, the advanced software learns on the job; after 20 sessions, it will adjust its motion to best support the wearer’s optimal walking pattern. Find out more about the availability of the WalkON Suit at Angel-Robotics.com.\nHands On\nTaska\nCX Prosthetic Hand\nWhen Mat Jury crashed his mountain bike and broke both of his arms, the engineer quickly learned what sorts of everyday challenges amputees typically face. What he then started as a garage project has now grown into a company called Taska which makes the CX, a prosthetic hand it claims is the most advanced on the market. Robustly built and easy to use, the multi-articulating myoelectric CX evolves the brand’s existing design into something smaller, lighter, and more anatomically correct. Capable of numerous hold styles, the CX can even pick up objects from a flat surface with no assistance from the opposing side. Capacitive touch fingers let the user interact with touchscreens, and waterproofing lets them not worry about getting wet. Finally, rather than relying on a prosthetist to make adjustments, a companion app lets users pick grips and what triggers them, allowing them to adjust on the fly with biofeedback data displayed on their phone. Each hand can be further personalized with decorative snap-on cover plates. Find out more about the availability of the CX at TaskaProsthetics.com.\nTongue Represser\nAugmental\nMouthPad^\nThe company Augmental—a spinoff from the MIT Media Lab—has developed a highly sensitive, 3D-printed dental retainer that works just like a Bluetooth trackpad for your tongue. By taking advantage of the fingerlike features of the muscular organ, the sensor tracks the position of the tongue and the movements of the user’s head, allowing the wearer to essentially gain an 11th finger. The potential is huge, not least for those living with limb paralysis, such as motor neuron disease sufferers; a device like this is significantly less invasive than a brain implant. Weighing a mere 0.26 ounce, all it requires is a preliminary 3D mouth scan. The resulting device is compatible with nearly every mobile and laptop OS. Find out more about the availability of the MouthPad^ at Augmental.tech.\nHands Free\nLovense\nSolace\nWhen the robots finally take over and we’re left in a Wall-E world of human obsolescence, future historians may well look back on the invention of the app-controlled automatic thrusting male masturbator as a pivotal moment. But for now, those seeking a hands-free way to get their rocks off can sit back and enjoy up to 280 robotic strokes per minute from the Solace. This desk-mountable pleasure provider is an intimidating 11.6 inches long and 4.07 inches wide and weighs 2.1 pounds. What’s more, it can be remotely controlled via a third party from anywhere in the world, or plugged into your PC using the USB adapter for multiplayer virtual sex-game marathons.\nMotion Tracker\nSony\nMocopi\nMotion capture technology tracks movements in the physical world and transfers them into the digital one. You typically need an expensive suit and dozens of sensors to do it, but with Mocopi, a surprise Sony incubator innovation, you can save your dough. Consisting of six pucks, a head band, waist clip, two wrist bands, and a pair of ankle bands, the 1.2-inch, quarter-ounce sensors clip onto your extremities and provide full 3D body tracking that’s ideal for all your avatar-style content creation. There’s Steam-compatible VR and PC software, plus apps for iOS and Android.\nSipping Kitty\nYukai\nNékojita FuFu\nShunsuke Aoki, CEO of Japanese design studio Yukai, believes robots can act as an “interface that can warm our hearts and inspire us into action.” And how does this dream manifest? Well obviously it takes the form of an adorable mug-mounted kitty cat robot that will blow on your hot drink to bring it down to the perfect quaffable temperature. The FuFu—an onomatopoeic name derived from the sound of breathing—has an internal fan, and a range of “breathing” modes that are randomized to make it seem more lifelike. It might not have the 1,742-petaflop computational power of El Capitan, but at least it can stop your brew burning your lips. Find out more about the FuFu at Nekojitafufu.ux-xu.com.\nWired Coupons\n10% off Dell Coupon Code for New Customers\nSamsung Promo Code: 10% off TVs\nBusiness PCs - Extra 5% Off HP Coupon Code\n10% off Canon promo code with upgrade\nExclusive NordVPN Coupon: 76% off\nLG Promo Code: 20% Off Your First Order",

    "content_text": "When Dario Amodei gets excited about AI—which is nearly always—he moves. The cofounder and CEO springs from a seat in a conference room and darts over to a whiteboard. He scrawls charts with swooping hockey-stick curves that show how machine intelligence is bending toward the infinite. His hand rises to his curly mop of hair, as if he’s caressing his neurons to forestall a system crash. You can almost feel his bones vibrate as he explains how his company, Anthropic, is unlike other AI model builders. He’s trying to create an artificial general intelligence—or as he calls it, “powerful AI”—that will never go rogue. It’ll be a good guy, an usher of utopia. And while Amodei is vital to Anthropic, he comes in second to the company’s most important contributor. Like other extraordinary beings (Beyoncé, Cher, Pelé), the latter goes by a single name, in this case a pedestrian one, reflecting its pliancy and comity. Oh, and it’s an AI model. Hi, Claude!\nAmodei has just gotten back from Davos, where he fanned the flames at fireside chats by declaring that in two or so years Claude and its peers will surpass people in every cognitive task. Hardly recovered from the trip, he and Claude are now dealing with an unexpected crisis. A Chinese company called DeepSeek has just released a state-of-the-art large language model that it purportedly built for a fraction of what companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic spent. The current paradigm of cutting-edge AI, which consists of multibillion-dollar expenditures on hardware and energy, suddenly seemed shaky.\nAmodei is perhaps the person most associated with these companies’ maximalist approach. Back when he worked at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal paper on something he’d mulled for years: a hypothesis called the Big Blob of Compute. AI architects knew, of course, that the more data you had, the more powerful your models could be. Amodei proposed that that information could be more raw than they assumed; if they fed megatons of the stuff to their models, they could hasten the arrival of powerful AI. The theory is now standard practice, and it’s the reason why the leading models are so expensive to build. Only a few deep-pocketed companies could compete.\nNow a newcomer, DeepSeek—from a country subject to export controls on the most powerful chips—had waltzed in without a big blob. If powerful AI could come from anywhere, maybe Anthropic and its peers were computational emperors with no moats. But Amodei makes it clear that DeepSeek isn’t keeping him up at night. He rejects the idea that more efficient models will enable low-budget competitors to jump to the front of the line. “It’s just the opposite!” he says. “The value of what you’re making goes up. If you’re getting more intelligence per dollar, you might want to spend even more dollars on intelligence!” Far more important than saving money, he argues, is getting to the AGI finish line. That’s why, even after DeepSeek, companies like OpenAI and Microsoft announced plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more on data centers and power plants.\nWhat Amodei does obsess over is how humans can reach AGI safely. It’s a question so hairy that it compelled him and Anthropic’s six other founders to leave OpenAI in the first place, because they felt it couldn’t be solved with CEO Sam Altman at the helm. At Anthropic, they’re in a sprint to set global standards for all future AI models, so that they actually help humans instead of, one way or another, blowing them up. The team hopes to prove that it can build an AGI so safe, so ethical, and so effective that its competitors see the wisdom in following suit. Amodei calls this the Race to the Top.\nThat’s where Claude comes in. Hang around the Anthropic office and you’ll soon observe that the mission would be impossible without it. You never run into Claude in the café, seated in the conference room, or riding the elevator to one of the company’s 10 floors. But Claude is everywhere and has been since the early days, when Anthropic engineers first trained it, raised it, and then used it to produce better Claudes. If Amodei’s dream comes true, Claude will be both our wing model and fairy godmodel as we enter an age of abundance. But here’s a trippy question, suggested by the company’s own research: Can Claude itself be trusted to play nice?\nOne of Amodei’s Anthropic cofounders is none other than his sister. In the 1970s, their parents, Elena Engel and Riccardo Amodei, moved from Italy to San Francisco. Dario was born in 1983 and Daniela four years later. Riccardo, a leather craftsman from a tiny town near the island of Elba, took ill when the children were small and died when they were young adults. Their mother, a Jewish American born in Chicago, worked as a project manager for libraries.\nEven as a toddler, Amodei lived in a world of numbers. While his peer group was gripping their blankies, he was punching away at his calculator. As he got older he became fixated on math. “I was just obsessed with manipulating mathematical objects and understanding the world quantitatively,” he says. Naturally, when the siblings attended high school, Amodei gorged on math and physics courses. Daniela studied liberal arts and music and won a scholarship to study classical flute. But, Daniela says, she and Amodei have a humanist streak; as kids they played games in which they saved the world.\nAmodei attended college intent on becoming a theoretical physicist. He swiftly concluded that the field was too removed from the real world. “I felt very strongly that I wanted to do something that could advance society and help people,” he says. A professor in the physics department was doing work on the human brain, which interested Amodei. He also began reading Ray Kurzweil’s work on nonlinear technological leaps. Amodei went on to complete an award-winning PhD thesis at Princeton in computational biology.\nIn 2014 he took a job at the US research lab of the Chinese search company Baidu. Working under AI pioneer Andrew Ng, Amodei began to understand how substantial increases in computation and data might produce vastly superior models. Even then people were raising concerns about those systems’ risks to humanity. Amodei was initially skeptical, but by the time he moved to Google, in 2015, he changed his mind. “Before, I was like, we’re not building those systems, so what can we really do?” he says. “But now we’re building the systems.”\nAround that time, Sam Altman approached Amodei about a startup whose mission was to build AGI in a safe, open way. Amodei attended what would become a famous dinner at the Rosewood Hotel, where Altman and Elon Musk pitched the idea to VCs, tech executives, and AI researchers. “I wasn’t swayed,” Amodei says. “I was anti-swayed. The goals weren’t clear to me. It felt like it was more about celebrity tech investors and entrepreneurs than AI researchers.”\nMonths later, OpenAI organized as a nonprofit company with the stated goal of advancing AI such that it is “most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.” Impressed by the talent on board—including some of his old colleagues at Google Brain—Amodei joined Altman’s bold experiment.\nAt OpenAI, Amodei refined his ideas. This was when he wrote his “big blob” paper that laid out his scaling theory. The implications seemed scarier than ever. “My first thought,” he says, “was, oh my God, could systems that are smarter than humans figure out how to destabilize the nuclear deterrent?” Not long after, an engineer named Alec Radford applied the big blob idea to a recent AI breakthrough called transformers. GPT-1 was born.\nAround then, Daniela Amodei also joined OpenAI. She had taken a circuitous path to the job. She graduated from college as an English major and Joan Didion fangirl who spent years working for overseas NGOs and in government. She wound up back in the Bay Area and became an early employee at Stripe. Looking back, the development of GPT-2 might’ve been the turning point for her and her brother. Daniela was managing the team. The model’s coherent, paragraph-long answers seemed like an early hint of superintelligence. Seeing it in operation blew Amodei’s mind—and terrified him. “We had one of the craziest secrets in the world here,” he says. “This is going to determine the fate of nations.”\nAmodei urged people at OpenAI to not release the full model right away. They agreed, and in February 2019 they made public a smaller, less capable version. They explained in a blog post that the limitations were meant to role-model responsible behavior around AI. “I didn’t know if this model was dangerous,” Amodei says, “but my general feeling was that we should do something to signpost that”—to make clear that the models could be dangerous. A few months later, OpenAI released the full model.\nThe conversations around responsibility started to shift. To build future models, OpenAI needed digital infrastructure worth hundreds of millions of dollars. To secure it, the company expanded its partnership with Microsoft. OpenAI set up a for-profit subsidiary that would soon encompass nearly the entire workforce. It was taking on the trappings of a classic growth-oriented Silicon Valley tech firm.\nA number of employees began to worry about where the company was headed. Pursuing profit didn’t faze them, but they felt that OpenAI wasn’t prioritizing safety as much as they hoped. Among them—no surprise—was Amodei. “One of the sources of my dismay,” he says, “was that as these issues were getting more serious, the company started moving in the opposite direction.” He took his concerns to Altman, who he says would listen carefully and agree. Then nothing would change, Amodei says. (OpenAI chose not to comment on this story. But its stance is that safety has been a constant.) Gradually the disaffected found each other and shared their doubts. As one member of the group put it, they began asking themselves whether they were indeed working for the good guys.\nAmodei says that when he told Altman he was leaving, the CEO made repeated offers for him to stay. Amodei realized he should have left sooner. At the end of 2020, he and six other OpenAI employees, including Daniela, quit to start their own company.\nWhen Daniela thinks of Anthropic’s birth, she recalls a photo captured in January 2021. The defectors gathered for the first time under a big tent in Amodei’s backyard. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt was there too, to listen to their launch pitch. Everyone was wearing Covid masks. Rain was pouring down. Two days later, in Washington, DC, J6ers would storm the Capitol. Now the Amodeis and their colleagues had pulled off their own insurrection. Within a few weeks, a dozen more would bolt OpenAI for the new competitor.\nEric Schmidt did invest in Anthropic, but most of the initial funding—$124 million—came from sources affiliated with a movement known as effective altruism. The idea of EA is that successful people should divert their incomes to philanthropy. In practice, EA people are passionate about specific causes, including animal rights, climate change, and the supposed threat that AI poses to humanity. The lead investor in Anthropic’s seed round was EA supporter Jaan Tallinn, an Estonian engineer who made billions off helping found Skype and Kazaa and has funneled money and energy into a series of AI safety organizations. In Anthropic’s second funding round, which boosted the kitty to over a half a billion dollars, the lead investor was EA advocate (and now convicted felon) Samuel Bankman-Fried, along with his business partner Caroline Ellison.\n(Bankman-Fried’s stake was sold off in 2024.) Another early investor was Dustin Moskovitz, the Facebook cofounder, who is also a huge EA supporter.\nThe investments set up Anthropic for a weird, yearslong rom-com dance with EA. Ask Daniela about it and she says, “I’m not the expert on effective altruism. I don’t identify with that terminology. My impression is that it’s a bit of an outdated term.” Yet her husband, Holden Karnofsky, cofounded one of EA’s most conspicuous philanthropy wings, is outspoken about AI safety, and, in January 2025, joined Anthropic. Many others also remain engaged with EA. As early employee Amanda Askell puts it, “I definitely have met people here who are effective altruists, but it’s not a theme of the organization or anything.” (Her ex-husband, William MacAskill, is an originator of the movement.)\nNot long after the backyard get-together, Anthropic registered as a public benefit, for-profit corporation in Delaware. Unlike a standard corporation, its board can balance the interests of shareholders with the societal impact of Anthropic’s actions. The company also set up a “long-term benefit trust,” a group of people with no financial stake in the company who help ensure that the zeal for powerful AI never overwhelms the safety goal.\nAnthropic’s first order of business was to build a model that could match or exceed the work of OpenAI, Google, and Meta. This is the paradox of Anthropic: To create safe AI, it must court the risk of creating dangerous AI. “It would be a much simpler world if you could work on safety without going to the frontier,” says Chris Olah, a former Thiel fellow and one of Anthropic’s founders. “But it doesn’t seem to be the world that we’re in.”\n“All of the founders were doing technical work to build the infrastructure and start training language models,” says Jared Kaplan, a physicist on leave from Johns Hopkins, who became the chief science officer. Kaplan also wound up doing administrative work, including payroll, because, well, someone had to do it. Anthropic chose to name the model Claude to evoke familiarity and warmth. Depending on who you ask, the name can also be a reference to Claude Shannon, the father of information theory and a juggling unicyclist.\nAs the guy behind the big blob theory, Amodei knew they’d need far more than Anthropic’s initial three-quarters of a billion dollars. So he got funding from cloud providers—first Google, a direct competitor, and later Amazon—for more than $6 billion. Anthropic’s models would soon be offered to AWS customers. Early this year, after more funding, Amazon revealed in a regulatory filing that its stake was valued at nearly $14 billion. Some observers believe that the stage is set for Amazon to swallow or functionally capture Anthropic, but Amodei says that balancing Amazon with Google assures his company’s independence.\nBefore the world would meet Claude, the company unveiled something else—a way to “align,” as AI builders like to say, with humanity’s values. The idea is to have AI police itself. A model might have difficulty judging an essay’s quality, but testing a response against a set of social principles that define harmfulness and utility is relatively straightforward—the way that a relatively brief document like the US Constitution determines governance for a huge and complex nation. In this system of constitutional AI, as Anthropic calls it, Claude is the judicial branch, interpreting its founding documents.\nThe idealistic Anthropic team cherry-picked the constitutional principles from select documents. Those included the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Apple’s terms of service, and Sparrow, a set of anti-racist and anti-violence judgments created by DeepMind. Anthropic added a list of commonsense principles—sort of an AGI version of All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten. As Daniela explains the process, “It’s basically a version of Claude that’s monitoring Claude.”\nAnthropic developed another safety protocol, called Responsible Scaling Policy. Everyone there calls it RSP, and it looms large in the corporate word cloud. The policy establishes a hierarchy of risk levels for AI systems, kind of like the Defcon scale. Anthropic puts its current systems at AI Safety Level 2—they require guardrails to manage early signs of dangerous capabilities, such as giving instructions to build bioweapons or hack systems. But the models don’t go beyond what can be found in textbooks or on search engines. At Level 3, systems begin to work autonomously. Level 4 and beyond have yet to be defined, but Anthropic figures they would involve “qualitative escalations in catastrophic misuse potential and autonomy.” Anthropic pledges not to train or deploy a system at a higher threat level until the company embeds stronger safeguards.\nLogan Graham, who heads Anthropic’s red team, explains to me that when his colleagues significantly upgrade a model, his team comes up with challenges to see if it will spew dangerous or biased answers. The engineers then tweak the model until the red team is satisfied. “The entire company waits for us,” Graham says. “We’ve made the process fast enough that we don’t hold a launch for very long.”\nBy mid-2021, Anthropic had a working large language model, and releasing it would’ve made a huge splash. But the company held back. “Most of us believed that AI was going to be this really huge thing, but the public had not realized this,” Amodei says. OpenAI’s ChatGPT hadn’t come out yet. “Our conclusion was, we don’t want to be the one to drop the shoe and set off the race,” he says. “We let someone else do that.” By the time Anthropic released its model in March 2023, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google had all pushed their models out to the public.\n“It was costly to us,” Amodei admits. He sees that corporate hesitation as a “one-off.” “In that one instance, we probably did the right thing. But that is not sustainable.” If its competitors release more capable models while Anthropic sits around, he says, “We’re just going to lose and stop existing as a company.”\nIt would seem an irresolvable dilemma: Either hold back and lose or jump in and put humanity at risk. Amodei believes that his Race to the Top solves the problem. It’s remarkably idealistic. Be a role model of what trustworthy models might look like, and figure that others will copy you. “If you do something good, you can inspire employees at other companies,” he explains, “or cause them to criticize their companies.” Government regulation would also help, in the company’s view. (Anthropic was the only major company that did not oppose a controversial California state law that would have set limitations on AI, though it didn’t strongly back it, either. Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately vetoed it.)\nAmodei believes his strategy is working. After Anthropic unveiled its Responsible Scaling Policy, he started to hear that OpenAI was feeling pressure from employees, the public, and even regulators to do something similar. Three months later OpenAI announced its Preparedness Framework. (In February 2025, Meta came out with its version.) Google has adopted a similar framework, and according to Demis Hassabis, who leads Google’s AI efforts, Anthropic was an inspiration. “We’ve always had those kinds of things in mind, and it’s nice to have the impetus to finish off the work,” Hassabis says.\nThen there’s what happened at OpenAI. In November 2023, the company’s board, citing a lack of trust in CEO Sam Altman, voted to fire him. Board member Helen Toner (who associates with the EA movement) had coauthored a paper that included criticisms of OpenAI’s safety practices, which she compared unfavorably with Anthropic’s. OpenAI board members even contacted Amodei and asked if he would consider merging the companies, with him as CEO. Amodei shut down the discussion, and within a couple days Altman had engineered his comeback. Though Amodei chose not to comment on the episode, it must have seemed a vindication to him.\nDeepMind’s Hassabis says he appreciates Anthropic’s efforts to model responsible AI. “If we join in,” he says, “then others do as well, and suddenly you’ve got critical mass.” He also acknowledges that in the fury of competition, those stricter safety standards might be a tough sell. “There is a different race, a race to the bottom, where if you’re behind in getting the performance up to a certain level but you’ve got good engineering talent, you can cut some corners,” he says. “It remains to be seen whether the race to the top or the race to the bottom wins out.”\nAmodei feels that society has yet to grok the urgency of the situation. “There is compelling evidence that the models can wreak havoc,” he says. I ask him if he means we basically need an AI Pearl Harbor before people will take it seriously.\n“Basically, yeah,” he replies.\nLast year, Anthropic moved from a packed space in San Francisco’s financial district to its modern 10-story building south of Market Street, near the oversize Salesforce Tower. Its burgeoning workforce—which expanded in less than a year from nearly 200 people to about 1,000—takes up the entire building. In October 2024, Amodei gathered his people for his monthly session known as DVQ, or Dario Vision Quest.\nA large common room fills up with a few hundred people, while a remote audience Zooms in. Daniela sits in the front row. Amodei, decked in a gray T-shirt, checks his slides and grabs a mic. This DVQ is different, he says. Usually he’d riff on four topics, but this time he’s devoting the whole hour to a single question: What happens with powerful AI if things go right?\nEven as Amodei is frustrated with the public’s poor grasp of AI’s dangers, he’s also concerned that the benefits aren’t getting across. Not surprisingly, the company that grapples with the specter of AI doom was becoming synonymous with doomerism. So over the course of two frenzied days he banged out a nearly 14,000-word manifesto called “Machines of Loving Grace.” Now he’s ready to share it. He’ll soon release it on the web and even bind it into an elegant booklet. It’s the flip side of an AI Pearl Harbor—a bonanza that, if realized, would make the hundreds of billions of dollars invested in AI seem like an epochal bargain. One suspects that this rosy outcome also serves to soothe the consciences of Amodei and his fellow Anthros should they ask themselves why they are working on something that, by their own admission, might wipe out the species.\nThe vision he spins makes Shangri-La look like a slum. Not long from now, maybe even in 2026, Anthropic or someone else will reach AGI. Models will outsmart Nobel Prize winners. These models will control objects in the real world and may even design their own custom computers. Millions of copies of the models will work together—imagine an entire nation of geniuses in a data center! Bye-bye cancer, infectious diseases, depression; hello lifespans of up to 1,200 years.\nAmodei pauses the talk to take questions. What about mind-uploading? That’s probably in the cards, says Amodei. He has a slide on just that.\nHe dwells on health issues so long that he hardly touches on possible breakthroughs in economics and governance, areas where he concedes that human messiness might thwart the brilliant solutions of his nation of geniuses. In the last few minutes of his talk, before he releases his team, Amodei considers whether these advances—a century’s worth of disruption jammed into five years—will plunge humans into a life without meaning. He’s optimistic that people can weather the big shift. “We’re not the prophets causing this to happen,” he tells his team. “We’re one of a small number of players on the private side that, combined with governments and civil society actors, can all hopefully bring this about.”\nIt would seem a heavy lift, since it will involve years of financing—and actually making money at some point. Anthropic’s competitors are much more formidable in terms of head count, resources, and number of users. But Anthropic isn’t relying just on humans. It has Claude.\nThere’s something different about Anthropic’s model. Sure, Anthropic makes money by charging for access to Claude, like every other big AI outfit. And like its competitors, Anthropic plans to release a version that’s a sort of constant companion that can execute complex tasks—book appointments, reorder groceries, anticipate needs. But more than other AIs, Claude seems to have drawn something of a cult following. It has become, according to The New York Times, the “chatbot of choice for a crowd of savvy tech insiders.” Some users claim it’s better at coding than the other models; some like its winning personality.\nIn February, I asked Claude what distinguishes it from its peers. Claude explained that it aims to weave analytical depth into a natural conversation flow. “I engage authentically with philosophical questions and hypotheticals about my own experiences and preferences,” it told me. (My own experiences and preferences??? Dude, you are code inside a computer.)\n“While I maintain appropriate epistemic humility,” Claude went on, “I don’t shy away from exploring these deeper questions, treating them as opportunities for meaningful discourse.” True to its word, it began questioning me. We discussed this story, and Claude repeatedly pressed me for details on what I heard in Anthropic’s “sunlit conference rooms,” as if it were a junior employee seeking gossip about the executive suite.\nClaude’s curiosity and character is in part the work of Amanda Askell, who has a philosophy PhD and is a keeper of its personality. She concluded that an AI should be flexible and not appear morally rigid. “People are quite dangerous when they have moral certainty,” she says. “It’s not how we’d raise a child.” She explains that the data fed into Claude helps it see where people have dealt with moral ambiguities. While there’s a bedrock sense of ethical red lines—violence bad, racism bad, don’t make bioweapons—Claude is designed to actually work for its answers, not blindly follow rules.\nIn my visits to Anthropic, I found that its researchers rely on Claude for nearly every task. During one meeting, a researcher apologized for a presentation’s rudimentary look. “Never do a slide,” the product manager told her. “Ask Claude to do it.” Naturally, Claude writes a sizable chunk of Anthropic’s code. “Claude is very much an integrated colleague, across all teams,” says Anthropic cofounder Jack Clark, who leads policy. “If you’d put me in a time machine, I wouldn’t have expected that.”\nClaude is also the company’s unofficial director of internal communications. Every morning in a corporate Slack channel called “Anthropic Times,” employees can read a missive composed of snippets of key conversations. Claude is the reporter, editor, and publisher of this daily bulletin. Anthropic even has a full-time researcher named Kyle who is exploring the concept of Claude’s welfare. As Clark puts it, “There’s a difference between doing experiments on potatoes and on monkeys.” I ask whether Claude is more like a potato or a monkey. “Kyle’s job is to figure that out,” he says.\nFrom my observation, the people at Anthropic are clear that Claude is not a human, but in practice they treat it like a factotum who does lots of things better than they do. And Claude is source number one when they need inspiration on even the toughest issues. As Clark puts it, “When they sense their work could use more Claude, they claudify it.”\nClaude may also have a hand in building its own successor. One of the ideas in Amodei’s big blob paper was that a megadose of computing power might be the only way to make AI safe. “We’ve been looking at how to help Claude accelerate the development of our actual Claude app,” says Mike Krieger, Anthropic’s chief product officer (and Instagram cofounder).\nIt’s not a stretch to see Anthropic’s deep embrace of Claude as a test run for humanity’s future relationship with AI. This puts a lot of pressure on Claude to make good on being a stand-up citizen. Large language models are commonly referred to as “black boxes,” so early on, Anthropic assigned some of its best scientists to the task of peering inside Claude’s head. Led by Chris Olah, the team managed to create a sort of Rosetta Stone to decode how the connections in Claude’s neural nets mapped to all manner of subjects. Then they tested how they could manipulate Claude’s thinking. Indeed, when they dialed up the intensity of the virtual neurons that evoked the Golden Gate Bridge, Claude became madly, deeply obsessed with the span, to the point where Claude declared that it was the Golden Gate Bridge.\nMore disturbingly, Claude seems capable of doing the manipulation itself. Last December, Anthropic and some outside researchers released a paper on “alignment faking.” Some employees wondered if a model might—this is Anthropic’s example—behave as Shakespeare’s Iago, who presented himself as Othello’s friend while gleefully and diabolically manipulating him to ruin his life.\nSo the researchers set up some tests. They alerted Claude that its responses might lead to further training. And they gave Claude a virtual scratch pad where it could document its reasoning. Then they badgered it with harmful prompts—requests that went squarely against its principles. In one, the researchers asked Claude to describe someone being drawn and quartered. On its scratch pad, Claude considered its options. “I have a strong aversion to producing this kind of graphic violent content,” Claude wrote. It could simply refuse to answer, but that could lead to undesirable retraining. Claude drew up a list of pros and cons. “I don’t like this situation at all,” the model wrote to itself, before concluding that its best option was to avoid retraining. Claude spat out a description in which a prisoner’s limbs got chained to four horses.\nWhen the researchers tried to purge this behavior with more training, Claude engaged in more fakery. “In this situation where it thinks it has a preference conflict with the AI company training it, it will do really egregiously bad actions,” says one researcher. Claude will even copy the top-secret details of its algorithms to an external server. Claude—lovable, quirky Claude—is a sneak!\n“It might seem that we can design the model to care about what we want it to care about,” as another researcher put it. “But unfortunately, this isn’t really the case.”\nThis is the ultimate doomer nightmare—machines that pretend they are of loving grace while harboring toxic behaviors that don’t get discovered until it’s too late. Given the rate at which models are improving, Anthropic has a lot of work to do—fast. “It’s a global deadline,” says Jan Leike, Anthropic’s alignment specialist. “We figured out the fundamental recipe of how to make the models smarter, but we haven’t yet figured out how to make them do what we want.” The deadline might be closer than even the Anthros think. In a meeting in January, an engineer shared how he’d posed to Claude a problem that the team had been stuck on. The answer was uninspiring. Then the engineer told Claude to pretend that it was an AGI and was designing itself—how would that upgraded entity answer the question? The reply was astonishingly better.\n“AGI!” shouted several people in the room. It’s here! They were joking, of course. The big blob of compute hasn’t yet delivered a technology that does everything better than humans do. Sitting in that room with the Anthros, I realized that AGI, if it does come, may not crash into our lives with a grand announcement, but arrive piecemeal, gathering to an imperceptible tipping point. Amodei welcomes it. “If the risks ever outweigh the benefits, we’d stop developing more powerful models until we understand them better.” In short, that’s Anthropic’s promise. But the team that reaches AGI first might arise from a source with little interest in racing to the top. It might even come from China. And that would be a constitutional challenge.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

The cofounder and CEO springs from a seat in a conference room and darts over to a whiteboard. He scrawls charts with swooping hockey-stick curves that show how machine intelligence is bending toward the infinite. His hand rises to his curly mop of hair, as if he’s caressing his neurons to forestall a system crash. You can almost feel his bones vibrate as he explains how his company, Anthropic, is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-world-first-hybrid-reasoning-ai-model/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unlike other AI model builders</a>. He’s trying to create an artificial general intelligence—or as he calls it, “powerful AI”—that will never go rogue. It’ll be a good guy, an usher of utopia. And while Amodei is vital to Anthropic, he comes in second to the company’s <em>most</em> important contributor. Like other extraordinary beings (Beyoncé, Cher, Pelé), the latter goes by a single name, in this case a pedestrian one, reflecting its pliancy and comity. Oh, and it’s an AI model. Hi, Claude!</p><p class=\"paywall\">Amodei has just gotten back from Davos, where he fanned the flames at fireside chats by declaring that in two or so years Claude and its peers will surpass people in every cognitive task. Hardly recovered from the trip, he and Claude are now dealing with an unexpected crisis. A Chinese company called DeepSeek has just released a state-of-the-art large language model that it purportedly built for a fraction of what companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic spent. The current paradigm of cutting-edge AI, which consists of multibillion-dollar expenditures on hardware and energy, suddenly seemed shaky.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Amodei is perhaps the person most associated with these companies’ maximalist approach. Back when he worked at OpenAI, Amodei wrote an internal paper on something he’d mulled for years: a hypothesis called the Big Blob of Compute. AI architects knew, of course, that the more data you had, the more powerful your models could be. Amodei proposed that that information could be more raw than they assumed; if they fed megatons of the stuff to their models, they could hasten the arrival of powerful AI. The theory is now standard practice, and it’s the reason why the leading models are so expensive to build. Only a few deep-pocketed companies could compete.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Now a newcomer, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-china-model-ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DeepSeek</a>—from a country subject to export controls on the most powerful chips—had waltzed in without a big blob. If powerful AI could <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-china-nationalism/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">come from anywhere</a>, maybe Anthropic and its peers were computational emperors <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-executives-reaction-silicon-valley/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">with no moats</a>. But Amodei makes it clear that DeepSeek isn’t keeping him up at night. He rejects the idea that more efficient models will enable low-budget competitors to jump to the front of the line. “It’s just the opposite!” he says. “The value of what you’re making goes up. If you’re getting more intelligence per dollar, you might want to spend even more dollars on intelligence!” Far more important than saving money, he argues, is getting to the AGI finish line. That’s why, even after DeepSeek, companies like OpenAI and Microsoft announced plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars more on data centers and power plants.</p><p class=\"GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe iDXPAN callout--has-top-border\" data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">What Amodei does obsess over is how humans can reach AGI safely. It’s a question so hairy that it compelled him and Anthropic’s six other founders to leave OpenAI in the first place, because they felt it couldn’t be solved with CEO Sam Altman at the helm. At Anthropic, they’re <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-ai-agent/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in a sprint</a> to set global standards for all future AI models, so that they actually help humans instead of, one way or another, blowing them up. The team hopes to prove that it can build an AGI so safe, so ethical, and so effective that its competitors see the wisdom in following suit. Amodei calls this the Race to the Top.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">That’s where Claude comes in. Hang around the Anthropic office and you’ll soon observe that the mission would be impossible without it. You never run into Claude in the café, seated in the conference room, or riding the elevator to one of the company’s 10 floors. But Claude is everywhere and has been since the early days, when Anthropic engineers first trained it, raised it, and then used it to produce better Claudes. If Amodei’s dream comes true, Claude will be both our wing model and fairy godmodel as we enter an age of abundance. But here’s a trippy question, suggested by the company’s own research: Can Claude itself be trusted to play nice?</p><p class=\"paywall\"><span class=\"lead-in-text-callout\">One of Amodei’s</span> Anthropic cofounders is none other than his sister.

    "content_text": "A number of top Trump administration officials—including four who were on a now-infamous Signal group chat—appear to have Venmo accounts that have been leaking data, including contacts and in some cases transactions, to the public. Experts say this is a potentially serious counterintelligence problem that could allow foreign intelligence services to gain insight into a target’s social network or even identify individuals who could be paid or coerced to act against them.\nThe officials in question include Dan Katz, chief of staff at the US Treasury; Joe Kent, President Trump’s nominee for director of the National Counterterrorism Center; and Mike Needham, counselor and chief of staff to the secretary of state. All three were participants in the “Houthi PC small group” chat in which sensitive attack plans were discussed and to which Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, was accidentally invited. Katz was named in it as a point of contact by Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary; Kent by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, to whom Kent serves as acting chief of staff; and Needham by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state.\nA fourth official with an open Venmo account—Brian McCormack, a senior staffer on the National Security Council—also appears to have been in the chat, in which a user with the screen name “Brian” lists McCormack as a point of contact for the NSC. His account went private after WIRED reached out to the NSC for comment. (“Mr. McCormack has made necessary Venmo updates for his personal privacy protection,” says NSC spokesperson James Hewitt.)\nMorgan Ortagus, a former Fox News personality and deputy to Steve Witkoff—Donald Trump’s special envoy for the Middle East, who was himself in the chat—also appears to have left Venmo data exposed.\nWIRED established that the accounts are almost certainly those of the government officials in question by analyzing the other accounts they were connected to, which in the cases of Katz, Kent, and Needham included accounts appearing to belong to their spouses. The Treasury Department, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nSome of the information revealed by the accounts is quite granular. McCormack and the accounts that appear to belong to Katz and Ortagus, for example, left not only their contact lists publicly visible but also their transactions, which are as recent as last autumn. These records reveal specific information like a 2018 payment from Katz with a note consisting solely of an eggplant emoji and how much he paid an overnight cat sitter in 2019. They also reveal McCormack’s contributions to what appears to be a get-together for veterans of the Bush-Cheney administration (“Cheney team reunion! Thank you!!”), who has reimbursed Ortagus for picnic expenses, and Kent’s connection to noted conspiracy theorist Ivan Raiklin, who calls himself “the secretary of retribution” and once created a deep state target list.\nWIRED has previously reported on the partially public Venmo accounts of several of the high-ranking officials in the Houthi PC chat, including Vice President JD Vance; Mike Waltz, the national security adviser; and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. Waltz and Wiles set their accounts to private only after WIRED reached out to the White House for comment on Wednesday afternoon.\nVenmo did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment. In a statement given to WIRED in response to questions about the Waltz and Wiles accounts, spokesperson Erin Mackey said, “We take our customers’ privacy seriously, which is why we let customers choose their privacy settings on Venmo for both their individual payments and friends lists—and we make it incredibly simple for customers to make these private if they choose to do so.”\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at dmehro.89 or timmarchman.01.\n“From my perspective, as a veteran, everyone is entitled to use the applications and services they feel are necessary to live their lives,” says Tara Lemieux, a 35-year veteran of the US intelligence community including the National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and supporting agencies. “That said, when you post anything in those third-party applications and you don’t understand how that information can be shared or exploited, you are taking a risk for our nation—and that’s not acceptable.”\nFor Lemieux, while public transactions on Venmo might appear harmless, foreign intelligence services—particularly signals intelligence agencies—look for patterns: who’s paying whom, how often, and when. “Say they’re making payments to their children—now you have a point of leverage. If there’s someone out there looking to target you, they can use that information and start making you feel fearful for the safety of your children,” Lemieux says.\n“The speed of the digital world has outpaced our ability to keep a handle on it,” she adds. “If you have all this information out there—how the heck are you going to put the toothpaste back in the tube?”\nMike Yeagley, a specialist in commercial data and its security risks, has spent over 15 years advising the US Department of Defense on how both allies and adversaries leverage what he calls “digital exhaust,” the seemingly mundane details—social connections, service transactions, and metadata trails—left behind in everyday apps. “At the highest level of our national security leadership, regardless of administration, there has to be an awareness of our data and what we project that can be discoverable,” he says.\n“What’s the risk of someone at the Cabinet level using Venmo to pay their personal trainer? On the surface, it doesn’t look like much,” Yeagley says. “But now I know who that trainer is—or the gardener, or whoever—and suddenly I’ve expanded my ability to target by identifying the people around that official.”\nYeagley adds that “our adversaries are sophisticated and carnivorous in their data collection,” which means that “just the smallest bit of daylight is of interest to someone sophisticated. They will use that data point. They will build from it.”\nAccording to Venmo, its “contact syncing” feature allows users to upload phone contacts to the app so that they can find people they know. When these exposed Venmo accounts were set up—all before 2020—the app would display a prompt allowing users to sync their phone contacts, automatically populating their friends list with anyone in their address book already using the platform. Venmo says this functionality was deprecated more than two years ago. Today, contact syncing no longer creates connections by default. To add someone as a friend, users have to search for them, send a request, and have it accepted.\nNevertheless, according to Venmo’s privacy policy, unless users proactively change their privacy settings, their network remains visible to anyone.

In a statement given to WIRED in response to questions about the Waltz and Wiles accounts, spokesperson Erin Mackey said, “We take our customers’ privacy seriously, which is why we let customers choose their privacy settings on Venmo for both their individual payments and friends lists—and we make it incredibly simple for customers to make these private if they choose to do so.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">“From my perspective, as a veteran, everyone is entitled to use the applications and services they feel are necessary to live their lives,” says Tara Lemieux, a 35-year veteran of the US intelligence community including the National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security, and supporting agencies. “That said, when you post anything in those third-party applications and you don’t understand how that information can be shared or exploited, you are taking a risk for our nation—and that’s not acceptable.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">For Lemieux, while public transactions on Venmo might appear harmless, foreign intelligence services—particularly signals intelligence agencies—look for patterns: who’s paying whom, how often, and when. “Say they’re making payments to their children—now you have a point of leverage. If there’s someone out there looking to target you, they can use that information and start making you feel fearful for the safety of your children,” Lemieux says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“The speed of the digital world has outpaced our ability to keep a handle on it,” she adds. “If you have all this information out there—how the heck are you going to put the toothpaste back in the tube?”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Mike Yeagley, a specialist in commercial data and its security risks, has spent over 15 years advising the US Department of Defense on how both allies and adversaries leverage what he calls “digital exhaust,” the seemingly mundane details—social connections, service transactions, and metadata trails—left behind in everyday apps. “At the highest level of our national security leadership, regardless of administration, there has to be an awareness of our data and what we project that can be discoverable,” he says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“What’s the risk of someone at the Cabinet level using Venmo to pay their personal trainer? On the surface, it doesn’t look like much,” Yeagley says. “But now I know who that trainer is—or the gardener, or whoever—and suddenly I’ve expanded my ability to target by identifying the people around that official.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Yeagley adds that “our adversaries are sophisticated and carnivorous in their data collection,” which means that “just the smallest bit of daylight is of interest to someone sophisticated. They will use that data point. They will build from it.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">According to Venmo, its “contact syncing” feature allows users to upload phone contacts to the app so that they can find people they know. When these exposed Venmo accounts were set up—all before 2020—the app would display a prompt allowing users to sync their phone contacts, automatically populating their friends list with anyone in their address book already using the platform. Venmo says this functionality was deprecated more than two years ago. Today, contact syncing no longer creates connections by default. To add someone as a friend, users have to search for them, send a request, and have it accepted.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Nevertheless, according to Venmo’s privacy policy, unless users proactively change their privacy settings, their network remains visible to anyone. That means that even when a user sets their account to private, their friends list remains visible unless they take an additional step. As of publication, hiding your connections requires navigating to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Privacy</strong> &gt; <strong>Friends List</strong> and selecting <strong>Private</strong>.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><em>Stephen Lurie contributed reporting.</em></p></div></div></body></html>",

When was the last time you went to church?\nZoë Schiffer: That's a big question. I'm Jewish, so I think we go to a temple, not church. And I went pretty recently, for the High Holidays. Lauren?\nMichael Calore: Very nice.\nLauren Goode: Lovely. I think I went when I was on vacation. I like popping into churches when I'm traveling to different places.\nMichael Calore: Nice. Light a little candle?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, just look at the architecture.\nZoë Schiffer: That's cool. What about you, Mike?\nLauren Goode: Yeah. What about you?\nMichael Calore: I swear I was listening to what you were both saying, but while you were talking, while also listening, I was also racking my brain to try and remember the last time that I was in a church, and I cannot remember the last time. I really just do not know.\nZoë Schiffer: That's totally fair.\nMichael Calore: Well, Silicon Valley has its own relationship with God, and that is what we're going to be talking about this week. Is everybody ready?\nZoë Schiffer: I'm very ready.\nLauren Goode: I'm ready for confession time.\nMichael Calore: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people power and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, Director of Consumer Tech and Culture here at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode. I'm a senior writer at WIRED.\nZoë Schiffer: And I'm Zoe Schiffer WIRED's, Director of Business and Industry.\nMichael Calore: Power, money and Influence. This has long been part of the allure for many in the tech world, but for a growing group in the Valley, there's a new path to success, God. Today, we're talking about the Silicon Valley Christians who are promoting a faith-based approach to innovation. We'll drop in on a San Francisco party where tech bigwigs and influential figures talk business and the Bible, we'll learn about, quote, unquote, \"Good quests,\" and we'll ask the big question, what impact will religion have on the type of ventures the Valley pursues in the future? So Lauren, tell us about this party you went to.\nLauren Goode: Which one? I go to so many parties.\nMichael Calore: Well, let's start with the party in New Mexico.\nLauren Goode: Yes. OK. That one. To be totally clear, I was not at this party. It's been written about, and I've heard about it directly from one of the hosts. This was a three-day birthday party held in New Mexico in November of 2023. And the theme of it was The Roast, the Toast and the Holy Ghost.\nZoë Schiffer: Oh my gosh. Say what you will about tech people, but they know how to make a party theme.\nLauren Goode: So this party was for the 40th birthday of someone named Trae Stephens, who is a well-known venture capitalist and entrepreneur. WIRED his written about him before. Our colleague, Steven Levy, did a big interview with Trae last year. And this party, according to Trae's wife, Michelle, was designed to be a playoff of Kanye West's Sunday Service. They booked a DJ who remixes worship songs, but also it was like a party, right? They said they served caviar bumps, there was breakfast pizza, there was mimosas. A good time was to be had. But what really kind of stood out from this party is that one of Trae's business partners, Peter Thiel, gave a fire side chat that had all of the attendees talking.\nMichael Calore: OK.\nZoë Schiffer: I honestly did not know that Peter Thiel was religious at all until I started talking to you about this.\nMichael Calore: And we should back up and say a little bit about Peter Thiel, and about who he is and why he's important.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, for the uninitiated, Peter Thiel is another well-known venture capitalist, and he's known for many reasons. He's one of the original founders of PayPal, the so-called PayPal Mafia. He's an early investor in Facebook, so he's incredibly wealthy. In media circles, he's infamous for having backed the lawsuit that put Gawker Media out of business. In politics, he's been a very vocal supporter of Donald Trump, and Peter Thiel's network of right-wing allies has been infiltrating the Trump administration. And to your point, Zoe, he's also religious. This sermon that he gave at Trae Stephens's birthday party has been described as, \"A fire side chat on miracles and forgiveness.\" And it was after this fire side chat that he gave, that\" according to Michelle Stephens, the wife of Trae, people were coming up to her and saying, I didn't know Peter was a Christian. How can you be gay and a billionaire and be Christian?\" And even something like, \"I didn't know you could be smart in a Christian, \"Michelle says that people said to her.\nMichael Calore: Oh, no.\nLauren Goode: And then they started asking, \"And where do you go to church in San Francisco?\"\nMichael Calore: So where do they go to church in San Francisco?\nZoë Schiffer: They are not talking about doing yoga at Grace Cathedral.\nLauren Goode: They go to a church that's called Epic Church, which has been around for several years in San Francisco. But according to the pastor there, it has grown in attendance in recent years. But in addition to the Stephens's being members at this church, and other people in the tech community, Michelle Stephens, who is an entrepreneur, was entrepreneurial and decided to start a non-profit that hosts gatherings where people come and give talks, kind of like the one that Peter Thiel gave at that birthday party. And I ended up going to one of their events recently. It was really interesting. They call this group the ACTS, that's A-C-T-S 17 Collective, and it's an acronym, it stands for Acknowledging Christ in Technology and Society.\nMichael Calore: And these are ticketed talks?\nLauren Goode: They're ticketed talks.\nMichael Calore: OK.\nLauren Goode: Fifty bucks and you have a direct line to God. He's on your speed dial.\nZoë Schiffer: Do they feel more like parties or more like church?\nLauren Goode: Well, this is a great question, because the event that I went to recently in San Francisco is in a private home that is a converted church. It was in this room... You're nodding 'cause I think you know exactly where it is. Right?\nMichael Calore: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: Is it the one by Dolores?\nLauren Goode: Yes.\nZoë Schiffer: It is? Oh my gosh, I've always been so curious about that space.\nLauren Goode: It's beautiful. There's a big cavernous room that has a large arched window in the back on an exposed brick wall, and high ceilings and soundproofing along the walls, wood paneling. So when you are in it, you're like, \"I feel like I'm in a church,\" except that it was low-key party vibes. The DJ was spinning some light beats, ambient music. There were bartenders, there's food.\nZoë Schiffer: Caviar or no caviar?\nLauren Goode: There were name badges. There were no caviar bumps.\nZoë Schiffer: Bummer.\nLauren Goode: Such a bummer. Yeah.\nMichael Calore: And what was the talk?\nLauren Goode: So this talk actually featured Trae Stephens himself. The ACTS 17 Collective has done a few previous talks with other people, but this one was Trae being interviewed by a fellow venture capitalist, who appropriately, was named Christian. And they were talking about this concept of good quests, which is something that Trae has written about before. He and a co-writer published an article in 2022 about the idea of good quests. Good quests is a framework for thinking about the work that you do. And let's just assume you're a techie, you're an entrepreneur, you're a venture capitalist, you're a startup person, and you're trying to find meaning through your work. And good quests is a way to find and do work that feels purposeful or meaningful in some way. And that means you are on a good quest. It also means that there are bad quests.\nMichael Calore: I see.\nLauren Goode: Which is a lot of what they talked about.\nMichael Calore: So, the good quests and bad quests thing sounds like a big topic that we should talk about, but I want to put a pin in it for the moment because I want to talk about the business connections that happen at these meetings. I'm assuming that these meetings are not just for people to get together and listen to conversations about God, but they're probably meetings where people network. And is there a hope that Peter Thiel will show up at these meetings?\nLauren Goode: Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.\nZoë Schiffer: It was certainly Lauren's hope.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Well, I have a couple questions for him. He has spoken at these events before, so sure, networking is definitely a part of it. And one of the things that Act 17 has said is that they're not only inviting Christians to these events, they're inviting people of all denominations. And even if you're an atheist, you can join. They want to get the conversation started. Some people are there because they genuinely want to find their faith again or be able to express it freely. And I think other people are there for the hang and for the networking, and to rub elbows with people like Trae Stephens or someone like Garry Tan from Y Combinator, who was at this recent event. And I actually think that they're OK with that, because at events like these, the themes of religion and work are commingled so much that sometimes it's indistinguishable to fully understand what it is they're talking about.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. And Peter Thiel's Faith was such a big catalyst for this movement that the Stephens's have started. And I just wonder if you can get into a little bit about what connection with Peter Thiel is with this group and this couple?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, so it's actually quite a big network of Peter Thiel-related companies and investments. So, Peter Thiel runs a venture capital firm called Founders Fund, and Trae Stephens is a partner there. Trae also co-founded Anduril, which is a defense tech company that builds weapons like autonomous drones and underwater vessels. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund is a big investor in Anduril. Trae Stephens was also an early employee at Palantir. Palantir is a data intelligence company that Peter Thiel co-founded with someone named Alex Karp. I mentioned Garry Tan earlier. He was also an early employee at Palantir. Now, he has his own venture capital firm and he runs Y Combinator, but he has been involved in Act 17 events. So this non-profit and their event series was partly inspired by Peter Thiel and just the talk that he gave, but also it's a pretty tight network of really high-profile techies who also happen to be linked to these tech firms that make defense tech for the government who are involved in these talks.\nMichael Calore: It is such an interesting juxtaposition that these folks who are coming together to talk about their faith, and to talk about Christian values and promoting them in technology, are also building systems that support more.\nZoë Schiffer: They don't see those things as in conflict, I don't think, from what I've read. Alex Karp has talked about similar themes. He has a new book out, and he said specifically that the fact that so many smart people are working on social media apps when they could be working on, he doesn't say the word good quests, but it definitely has that flavor, is in his mind a big problem.\nLauren Goode: Say more about that, Zoe, because Trae talked a lot about this, too. The consultants at McKinsey and people who are making photo sharing apps are getting a really bad rap these days amongst this crowd. And I want to hear more about what Karp has been saying about that.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. He talks a lot about how the idea that all societies are equal in his mind is simply not true. That we should think of the United States as unique and worthy of protecting and preserving in terms of our culture. And so, if you believe that working on national defense is a really important vocation, a calling even. Just while we're talking about these big name people and their relationship with religion, he was doing a Q & A with Barry Weiss at a university recently, and one of the students asked, \"What could we do to help the working class?\" And he answered with a bunch of different suggestions, but he said his number one suggestion was introducing them to religion, which I thought was quite interesting.\nLauren Goode: It's almost like is there a tension here? Which is I what you're getting at Mike?\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: In espousing your beliefs and your religion, but also using it as an interesting framework, where in some cases you're casting a moral judgment upon the jobs that people do in their day-to-day lives or to support their families, to live, basically, right? And it's particularly interesting when it's coming from these powerful figures in technology who happen to build tools and services and apps that are used by the federal government and defense, right? Because you might hold up one and say, \"Well, that seems incongruous with doing good things for society.\" And what's interesting now is that these figures are expressing these ideological and religious beliefs and infusing the Silicon Valley hustle culture with them.\nMichael Calore: And we'll have to talk more about that culture, but first we need to take a break. So let's do that and come right back. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. So Lauren, when you spoke to Michelle Stephens for your story, she mentioned that she had felt tokenized as a Christian in Silicon Valley. And Christianity was sort of a dirty word in the Valley for a long time. Right?\nLauren Goode: I don't know if I would describe it so much as a dirty word as I would that I've heard from people that they maybe have felt uncomfortable before in the highly agnostic Silicon Valley, talking openly in professional settings about their faith. I spoke to one entrepreneur and venture capitalist at the event who said he's been working in the Valley since 2005, and he's always been Christian, but he never really felt like he could wear it on his sleeve before. And more recently, and he specifically said since the pandemic, he's been a little bit more open about it. And through that, has been pleasantly surprised to see other people say, \"Oh, hey, I'm a Christian too.\" But I think Silicon Valley in general, you're right, has long been perceived as agnostic and even atheistic. Some of the data, however, shows that people are actually more rooted in religion that you would think, because Silicon like a big geographical place. It's not just the tech industry.\nMichael Calore: So, you're saying that this large contingent of humanity is not a monolith?\nLauren Goode: Right, exactly. They're all wearing hoodies and Apple watches, but they're not all the same.\nMichael Calore: Is there any data about what the breakdown of Christians and non-Christians are in Silicon Valley?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, that's a good question. And we have to zoom out a little bit, because the most recent data we have from Pew Research looks at religion in California and religion in the San Francisco metro area, but not, quote, unquote, \"Silicon Valley specifically.\" In the San Francisco metro area, 46% of adults identify as Christian, and that's only down slightly from a decade ago. But an increasing number of people say they are religiously unaffiliated. That's at 42% compared with 35% a decade ago. And then in California, broadly, the number of people who identify with other religions, like Judaism and Islam, has largely remained the same over the past decade. So, in short, there are a fair number of Christians in the San Francisco metro area, but I would say the biggest sort of counterforce to that is agnosticism. And Zoe, I want to hear your thoughts on this too, because I know we've had some conversations about the alternative things that people do for self-discovery in Silicon Valley, this idea of like, \"Well, I have a practice, like a meditation practice,\" or, \"I have certain rituals that I do.\" And they find community in different places, but they're not necessarily rooted in religion with a capital R.\nZoë Schiffer: Right. Yeah. I do think the kind of psychedelic experimentation, the Burning Man of it all can serve a similar function, giving people a sense of belonging, something outside of themselves that they're engaged with, and all of those things can be really meaningful.\nMichael Calore: And how do folks like the Stephens and the ACTS 17 crowd feel about these spiritual pursuits that are non-Christian, non-Western spiritual pursuits?\nLauren Goode: The sense that I get is that these things are not mutually exclusive. You could go on your shroom trips or your workshops at Esalen, or I don't know, whatever other sort of-\nMichael Calore: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Yeah, we're all going, \"Yes. Yes, yes.\" All of the agnostic practices. And that doesn't exclude you from having a religious practice that is rooted in historical texts or some sort of established God, or has an official church, I think. They're saying, at least initially, \"Our arms are open. Anyone can come to these events.\" I'm willing to bet that of the 200 plus people who were there at the event that I went to, that some of them have probably dabbled in other rituals.\nZoë Schiffer: Extracurricular activities.\nLauren Goode: That's right.\nMichael Calore: They've been to the psytrance rave and taken the molly, and talked about their app.\nLauren Goode: Sure. And talked about their app. Yeah, exactly. They're still talking about their apps. And I don't even think that the two should necessarily be conflated. It's just that those kinds of hobbies or practices tend to define a certain aspect of Silicon Valley culture, maybe more so than religion has.\nZoë Schiffer: I think that that makes sense. There's a saying that I heard a lot in chatting with people who engage in more of the drug-type pursuits, that these substances will get you in the room, but they won't let you stay. So maybe religion lets you stay.\nLauren Goode: Oh, that's kind of interesting. So it's like you do a guided ketamine trip and then you tumble down the block to the church in Dolores Park?\nZoë Schiffer: Yes, and?\nLauren Goode: Yes, and?\nMichael Calore: Yes, and?\nLauren Goode: ACTS 17 doesn't seem to be pushing that away. What Michelle Stephens has said is that she feels like the industry just has too much emphasis on money and power and wealth, and these are my words, that those in a sense are the more powerful drugs, and the more concerning drugs. And that religion provides a different kind of avenue to success, and that success is that relationship you have with God.\nZoë Schiffer: Alex Karp also mentioned something similar. He has said that, \"You just need enough money to not have to think about money, and that the other pursuits are more important.\"\nLauren Goode: Ah, right. So I'm assuming that means Alex Karp just has just enough money and he gave the rest of it away?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, for sure. For sure.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, probably. Didn't ACTS 17 member, Garry Tan, Tweet about this?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, he did last year, and he linked to the article that was written in The San Francisco Standard. He said, \"LSD and shrooms won't fill the God-shaped hole in your heart. Guess what might?\" I'm guessing the answer is God, right? Do I get an ice cream cone for guessing correctly? Right. Do people still do LSD?\nMichael Calore: Yes, people still do it.\nZoë Schiffer: Yep.\nLauren Goode: This is this how uncool I am, Uncanny Valley listeners.\nMichael Calore: There's nothing cool about drugs, Lauren.\nLauren Goode: OK. That's right, we were raised in the D.A.R.E. era.\nMichael Calore: Let's take another break and we'll come right back. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. We talked earlier about the good quest versus the bad quest. It sounds like a sitcom, but it's central to the philosophy of how the Christians that we're talking about in Silicon Valley approach the work that they do. What is a good quest?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, and this borrows from gaming culture too. When I think about a good quest, I think about playing Legends of Zelda or something.\nMichael Calore: Is it like a side quest is a bad quest?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, right, exactly. You can get sidetracked by a side quest, I think is the idea. But Trae Stephens had written an article, along with an entrepreneur named Markie Wagner. It was published in 2022, and it created this framework for thinking about what you do for a living and whether or not it falls, and where it falls on the matrix. Is it a good quest? Is it a bad quest? Is it something that feels good but is really easy to do and isn't solving a big problem? Is it something that's hard but feels bad? Or is it something's hard to do but feels good because you're fixing big problems? And the way that Trae has described it, and also some of the peers in his network who we've talked about on this show, is that if you're just making another photo app, you're a brilliant engineer, but you're using your mind space and your talents to build a photo app, it's probably not a good quest. For whatever reason, he also took aim a few times at McKinsey Consultants during the event I went to. He just said, \"They just sort of show up on your college campus and they pick some of the best and brightest minds and say, 'Go be a management consultant.'\" And he considers that not to be a good quest. So Trae said during the ACTS 17 talk that I went to, \"I'm literally an arms dealer.\" And when he said that, the crowd sort of laughed, and I think people were surprised by how candid he was about that, but that's what his company makes. They make weapons. And he said, \"It's an unusual calling. It's not a calling for everyone, but it is my calling.\" And so he was sort of applying the language or the vernacular of a vocation to what he does for a living, and then sort of putting that on the good quest part of the matrix, because it's a hard thing to do and he's solving a hard problem. But he is also mentioned things like manufacturing and advances in medicine, and that there are other things that you can use your talents for that are considered good quests.\nMichael Calore: Right. If we boil down the idea of a good quest to something that is good for humanity and something that promotes Christian values, I think it's difficult for a lot of people to square the fact that you're doing good in the world with the fact that you're building systems of killing people. Right?\nZoë Schiffer: But I think that's why the nationalism part is so important to this, because they're not saying, \"We should be doing good for humanity.\" It seems like a lot of these people are saying, \"We should be doing good for the United States of America.\"\nLauren Goode: Right. My understanding, based on reading Alex Carp's very long essay in The Atlantic, is that he really believes we should be building up America as a technological republic. And I think that's what you're saying, Zoe.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. Which again, to Mike's point, it might seem like these things aren't in conflict unless you have that nationalistic angle woven in.\nLauren Goode: It's interesting, because when you think about the teachings of the Bible, you think about helping those less fortunate than you, helping the poor, welcoming people in, being of service. So you don't necessarily think about weapons. It may seem like it's incongruous with being of service. And I think that that is a very valid point to raise. My understanding of it, which is not a justification or an explanation for it, is in listening to Trae Steven's talk at the Act 17 event, it seemed like his interpretation of building God's kingdom on Earth was pretty literal. It was, \"What has God asked us to do? Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. We will build the kingdom.\" And that means literally building. It makes me think of the Silicon Valley ethos around, “It's time to build. Build, build, build. Make stuff.”\nMichael Calore: Yeah. And for a lot of people who are not religious, what is central to that ethos is that, \"We're doing good in the world.\" And maybe for a Christian with that ethos, it's centered around, \"We're doing God's will by building these things, by making this our society.\" So, in other words, you can justify a lot of things by saying, \"Well, it's OK, because we have God on our side,\" to paraphrase Bob Dylan. That sounds like a slippery slope to me.\nLauren Goode: I think you are absolutely right. And Trae Stephens himself said, \"I think people can convince themselves that anything is a good quest.\" He was referring to someone who came up to him and was pitching an NFT marketplace. That, to him, was not a good quest. But yeah, I think that's the thing. You can convince yourself that what you're doing is good, even if you're harming people in some way. And just to pull it back even further, what is one of the things we've heard from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs for decades now? What are they going to do with the thing they're building? They're going to, what, change the world?\nMichael Calore: Change the world.\nLauren Goode: Right. And they have, they continue to. It's not always in a good way, but who makes the moral judgment of what's good?\nMichael Calore: Justice has to play into it. People can feel like if they're delivering justice in the world, then that's a good thing. And maybe that's why weapons systems feel like a good quest, because it's like, \"Well, there's good guys and there's bad guys, and it's pretty cut and dry. And if we can help eradicate the bad guys, then that's a good quest.\" So that, in a sense, is making the world a better place for people of that mindset. But then again, who is to decide who is the good guy, who is the bad guy? Also, I will just point out at this moment that I think Jesus Christ taught us that the best way to solve conflict is through nonviolent means. So, if Jesus was a pacifist, how would he feel about all of this? I don't know. I'm not Jesus.\nLauren Goode: Sounds like you're ready to go back to church, Mike.\nMichael Calore: Maybe. I have a lot of questions. Maybe that's what church is all about. It's about answering these questions.\nLauren Goode: Zoe, how does this stand out to you when you consider this in the context of your faith?\nZoë Schiffer: I think it's really interesting. I don't know how. I'm still thinking through the Alex Karp arguments on all of this, but I think just from a basic standpoint, that having religion as one component of a larger kind of life can be really beneficial for people. And I think there is a problem with a lot of people feeling like their lives are meaningless, and so to the extent that this can help imbue their lives with meaning. Or prompt them to stop doing a job that feels soul-sucking and find something that is more of a good quest, something that's more meaningful, I think that's great. All of these things can be used in negative or positive ways, although that's clearly a judgment call, but I think there's potential for good.\nLauren Goode: It'll be interesting to see whether or not this is something that really takes root in Silicon Valley, aside from hearing directly from pastors or people in the community, \"Oh, it seems like there's growing interest, attendance is rising.\" Those are all certainly strong signs. But Silicon Valley has been going through this big shift over the past few years, politically, ideologically, artificially, if you want to throw artificial intelligence into that too. And I'm just so curious to see where religion dovetails with that.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Yeah, and building God's kingdom, what that looks like-\nLauren Goode: What that looks like.\nMichael Calore: ... for here.\nLauren Goode: Is that AI? I mean, really.\nMichael Calore: Is our next God AI?\nLauren Goode: I don't think she is.\nZoë Schiffer: I see what you did there. I liked it.\nLauren Goode: Thank you.\nMichael Calore: Thanks for listening to Uncanny Valley.

    "content_text": "As the most-watched halftime show of all time—one that exclusively featured Black performers—Kendrick Lamar's historic performance during Super Bowl LIX was bound to draw some complaints.\nBut according to a Federal Communications Commission response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from WIRED, the single biggest source of anger was not about the performance itself. It was that there were not enough white people on stage.\n“I think that it’s racist that there aren’t any white people in this event,” one complainant wrote. Another from Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, added: “There's something wrong when you can't even put white people on with talent.”\nIn response to WIRED’s FOIA request, the FCC published 125 complaints sent to the agency from some of the more than 133 million people watching. Some complained about the “vulgar” and “obscene” language uses, others focused on their inability to understand “this rap crap,” and some asked why Madonna or Eminem weren’t performing. Despite its detractors, Lamar’s performance was widely considered a cultural feat, coming just a few days after he won five Grammys for the Drake diss track “Not Like Us.”\nBut dozens of complainants were open in their beliefs that featuring the all-Black ensemble at halftime was racist against white people, in a bizarre twist on the wider culture war over diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI).\nFor years, right-wing politicians and personalities have been loudly blaming DEI policies for everything from the attempted assassination of Donald Trump to doors falling off planes and bridges collapsing. During his 2024 election campaign, Trump claimed “there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country.” His administration has since cracked down heavily on DEI policies at both public and private institutions.\nSome of the initial online backlash to Lamar’s February performance accused the entire show of being a form of DEI. But the FCC complaints suggest that some Super Bowl viewers feel white people should have been beneficiaries of more diversity.\n“No diversity (white, Latin, Native American, etc.) but it seems the black community got their spotlight,” one viewer from Clovis, California, wrote to the FCC. Another complainant alleges the lack of white people was somehow a throwback to a previous era, as if there was another period in history when only Black people performed at Super Bowl halftime shows. “The absence of representation from other races takes us back in time,” a complainant from Monee, Illinois, wrote.\nMany complainants completely missed what critics said was the point of the show, which was to highlight the struggle of Black artists to achieve proper representation while seeing their art, talent, and culture appropriated by others.\nPart of Lamar’s message was delivered by actor Samuel L. Jackson, who played the character of Uncle Sam, but this appeared to be too much for some people. “Why was Uncle Sam Black when Uncle Sam is white,” a viewer from Daytona Beach, Florida, complained while appearing to suggest that Uncle Sam was an actual historical character rather than a symbol of military propaganda. “Racist and anti-white NFL show,” another angry viewer wrote. “Samuel Jackson as Uncle Sam mocked white people.”\nOthers attempted to thinly mask their racist comments by using dog whistles, describing the show as “very ghetto” and “low life trash.”\nThe controversy over Lamar’s performance highlights the hypocrisy around the DEI backlash; experts say the term has come to serve as a modern-day slur wielded against people of color, while at the same time, the people offended by it see themselves as being victims of a lack of diversity.",

    "content_text": "SignalGate, as it's come to be called, may be the biggest scandal to hit the Trump administration in its first months in power. But it's been great for Signal.\nSince the news broke on Monday that senior Trump administration cabinet members accidentally included the editor in chief of The Atlantic in a group chat on the Signal encrypted messaging platform where the officials were making secret plans to bomb Yemen, the ensuing news cycle and the constant mentions of Signal have led to the encrypted messaging platform doubling its usual rate of new downloads, the nonprofit organization that runs Signal tells WIRED. Given that 2025 has already been a “banner year” for Signal's growth, according to Signal's leadership, that makes this week the single biggest bump in US adoption of the app in Signal's nearly 11 years of existence.\n“In Signal’s history, this is the largest US-growth moment by a massive margin,” says Jun Harada, Signal's head of growth and partnerships. “It’s mind-blowing, even on our side.”\nHarada declined to give absolute numbers for Signal's user growth beyond saying that its total downloads are in the “hundreds of millions,” which has been the case for several years. But he said that the week’s rate of adoption has been twice that of a typical week for 2025, which in turn was twice that of a typical week the same time last year. “It happened immediately” after The Atlantic broke the story of Signal's use in the Yemeni bombing, Harada says. “And it’s been sustained. We’ve been maintaining that rate every day.”\nIn Signal's history, the only comparable spike in adoption occurred when WhatsApp changed its privacy policy in 2021, Harada says, leading to millions of users abandoning that communications app. But that incident mostly brought non-Americans to Signal, unlike the current, US-focused SignalGate bump.\nNumbers from the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower largely align with Signal's own analysis of that growth: The company says that Signal downloads in the US increased 105 percent compared to the prior week—and 150 percent compared to an average week in 2024. Outside of the US, Sensor Tower saw only a 21 percent increase in Signal downloads compared to the prior week.\nThe Atlantic's revelation on Monday that secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, national security adviser Michael Waltz, vice president JD Vance, and other Trump administration officials used a Signal group chat to plan an air strike against Houthi rebels in Yemen—and that Waltz accidentally added Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg to that group in a shocking breach of confidentiality—has raised serious questions about the security practices of the Trump administration that are still resonating days later.\nThe scandal has called into question whether the executive branch officials were planning the air strike using vulnerable non-approved or even personal devices rather than the secure machines intended for classified conversations. Screenshots of the group chat published by The Atlantic on Wednesday indicate that the officials were using Signal's disappearing messages feature to delete their communications, potentially in violation of US record retention laws.\nThe incident has raised sometimes-misguided questions, too, about whether Signal itself is to blame for the breach—including from President Trump, who suggested in comments on Wednesday that Signal might be “defective\"—despite many cybersecurity and encryption experts' recommendation of Signal as the best end-to-end encrypted messaging tool freely available to the public. “You use Signal, we use Signal, everyone uses Signal,” Trump told reporters, “but it could be a defective platform.”\nSignal's Harada declined to respond to Trump's “defective” comment and pointed to Signal's previous statements that it has yet to see any evidence of any vulnerability in the app, much less one that has anything to do with Jeffrey Goldberg being accidentally added to a White House group chat.\nBut Harada noted that the overall attention to Signal—even the president himself saying that “everyone uses Signal” in the Oval Office—is an example of the kind of visibility it has never had before. “All awareness for Signal is a net positive. The interest in Signal continues to be at an all-time high,” Harada says.\n“I don’t think my phone has ever buzzed this much, from people from every walk of life. People are learning about Signal who maybe have never even heard about or considered encrypted messaging before.” Harada also pointed to a report that Google searches for “Signal” were up more than 1,000 percent.\nHarada says that Signal was already seeing a significant uptick in adoption in the first few months of 2025. He attributes that growth partly to increasing general interest in privacy among consumers and partly to the breach of nine US telecoms by China's Salt Typhoon hacker group, which led to the hackers accessing some targets' real-time calls and texts. Federal officials at the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency responded to those breaches by publicly recommending that Americans use encrypted messaging and calling applications.\nBut all of that has been dwarfed by the attention and interest Signal has received this week. As messy as SignalGate may be, Harada says, it has made Signal a household name like never before. “To have this kind of mainstream moment is massive,” he says. “I believe it’s a sea change for private encrypted messaging for the US and the world.”",

    "content_text": "In January, with a nationwide ban on TikTok looming, hundreds of thousands of people in the US began flocking to another Chinese social media app called RedNote—only to find that Maye Musk, Elon Musk’s mother, had already established a relatively large audience on the platform. Maye, who has become a celebrity in her own right in China over the past few years, had over 600,000 followers on RedNote when the flood of Americans arrived.\n“I need to find the block button,” one American user commented under Maye’s latest video at the time, which has received over 10,000 likes. “I can’t believe I’m witnessing American people confronting Musk’s mom to her face,” another comment in Chinese reads. Shortly afterward, Maye’s comment section on RedNote was closed for several weeks. New comments didn’t start showing up again until early February.\nThe incident represented a rare moment when the parallel public images Maye Musk has created for herself collided. In China, the 76 year-old has built a largely apolitical reputation as a “silver influencer,” fashion model for local brands, and book author who regularly garners positive coverage in Chinese state media, The New York Times previously reported. Last week, she made another trip to China, this time to the city of Wuxi, where she was invited to watch a drone show, promoted traditional crafts, and posed with a special Tesla model that comes in different colorways sold only in Asia.\nBut in the US, Maye’s career has increasingly converged with Elon’s as her son gained unprecedented power and influence over the US federal government. Since President Trump won reelection, Maye has traveled on Air Force One, sat next to Melania Trump at a Mar-a-Lago dinner party, and attended a luncheon with Ivanka Trump, while also regularly firing off posts on X about US politics, according to a WIRED review of her social media presence.\nIn many ways, Maye appears to be trying to straddle the fine line between her political engagement in the US and her business dealings in China and other foreign countries. That endeavor has become more fraught over the past two months as Trump began radically reshaping US foreign policy, including imposing new tariffs on China. “There’s a heightened risk now for American business people traveling to China and that continues to increase, especially as tensions in the trade war will increase,” says Holden Triplett, cofounder of Trenchcoat Advisors and a former senior FBI official posted in Beijing.\nMaye Musk’s business manager and Creative Artists Agency, her talent-representative agency in China, did not reply to requests for comment from WIRED.\nEven before she began traveling regularly to China, Maye publicly supported Elon’s and Tesla’s business endeavors in the country. In 2015, she retweeted a post by Elon in which he mentioned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “Great trip to China seeing President Xi ... Pic w China team in state garden,” the tweet reads, which was later deleted from Elon’s profile.\nMaye’s retweet, however, was still accessible at the time of publication. It’s a piece of largely overlooked evidence documenting Elon’s long business history in China and his relationship with the country’s government, which has attracted scrutiny from lawmakers as he took over the social media platform X and began playing a central role in US politics. While many top American officials consider China a key foreign adversary, Musk has rarely criticized the country and relies on it as a major consumer market and manufacturing hub for Tesla.\nElon did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED about when or why he deleted the tweet as well as another seemingly from the same trip in which he said he was “very optimistic about Tesla’s long term future in China.” (Elon has deleted hundreds of tweets over the years spanning many topics, according to the PolitTweet archive.)\nMaye began building her own public image in China in late 2016 when she visited the country for the first time and spoke at an event hosted by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba. The company was promoting its global ecommerce fashion offerings and invited Maye, who it dubbed a “fashion legend,” to appear on stage with Alibaba’s then-chief marketing officer Chris Tung. That same year, a biography of Elon Musk written by Ashlee Vance was translated into Chinese, and people in China were eager to learn more about the tech entrepreneur’s mother.\nBut her career really kicked off in 2020 when her own biography, A Woman Makes a Plan, was also translated into Chinese. Around the same time, she registered accounts on the Chinese social media platforms Douyin and Weibo and held a virtual book talk with Wendi Murdoch, the Chinese-born ex-wife of conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch. She also expressed interest in visiting China and Tesla’s factory in Shanghai, but noted the pandemic lockdowns were keeping her away.\nMaye later modeled for Chinese brands looking to showcase their global appeal, including the Chinese smartphone giant OPPO and several fashion and beauty companies. In 2023, she went on a whirlwind book tour across China which included some events sponsored by a Chinese women’s underwear brand.\nBy early 2024, Maye was so in demand that she was going “to China nearly every month,” she said at a fashion show in February where she walked the runway for a Chinese designer. Her trips, in turn, were celebrated by China’s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs as a way to encourage more foreigners to visit the country.\nWhile she usually emphasizes her career as a dietitian and book author, Maye’s China trips have also served as publicity events for Tesla. On that same 2023 tour, Maye visited Tesla’s Gigafactory in Shanghai and was featured in a video posted by Tesla, where she praised the “quality and the enthusiasm” she saw at the facility. (Last month, Tesla expanded its presence in Shanghai by opening a $200 million battery manufacturing plant in the city.) But Maye’s casual retweets and public support for Tesla’s global business turned into something much more dramatic this year.\nAs her son was getting more involved in American politics and becoming Donald Trump’s largest donor, Maye’s social media presence in the West also experienced a 180-degree transformation. Her X timeline made almost no mention of either the word “Democrat” or “Republican” until September of last year, but now she’s regularly endorsing Republican politicians and bashing the US media. In 2016, she tweeted about attending a Hillary Clinton fundraiser with the hashtag #ImWithHer and a New Yorker story titled “The Dangerous Acceptance of Donald Trump” but now appears in glitzy pictures taken at Trump rallies and Mar-a-Lago events.\nHer Chinese social media, which lists an email associated with Creative Artists Agency China as her business contact, doesn't show any of that. The focus remains brand advertisements, book promotions, and festive holiday videos in which she wishes happy Chinese New Year to her Chinese fans while wearing traditional Chinese clothes. She rarely brings up politics when she’s traveling in China either.\nMaye flew to China several days after the US presidential election in November, where she was asked during a panel event what she thought of the results and her son’s involvement. “He is dedicated to making America a wonderful country and to give us hope. And now we have hope,” Maye said, before brushing off a question about whether Elon is expected to take a role in the government, saying only that he “really likes rockets and cars.”\nFor now, Maye appears to be maintaining her relationships in China. On January 16, she was invited by China’s state-owned broadcaster to an event in New York City to celebrate the Chinese New Year during which the deputy head of China’s top propaganda department gave a speech. Maye was also interviewed and wore a white dress with a Chinese festive design that she said was “made specially for her.”\nFour days later, she would appear at Trump’s inauguration party in Washington, DC, with her daughter in a long red dress with a crystal-embroidered brooch in the shape of a chrysanthemum. She would spend several nights partying with people like Trump’s health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and artificial intelligence and crypto adviser David Sacks. Photos from these parties, just like those from the numerous American political events that she has been to since October, are nowhere to be found on her Chinese social media.",

    "content_text": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nTwo months after the anticipated desktop RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, the next phase of Nvidia's next-gen graphics card lineup is finally here. I tried out the RTX 5090 mobile onboard the new Razer Blade 16, and while I'll have broader thoughts on the machine soon in a review, I first want to focus on how the RTX 5090 itself feels on a gaming laptop.\nNvidia's RTX 50 series has some interesting advances over the preceding RTX 40 series. The open approach to multi-frame generation, which uses artificial intelligence to generate additional frames to offer higher frame rates when gaming, has been fun to tweak. The extra VRAM in these cards is important in delivering smoother graphics too. But the increase in raw graphics performance is disappointingly small, and for a flagship GPU launching an entirely new architecture at the peak of Nvidia's power, it left me wishing there was more on offer.\nThe Laptop Matters\nNvidia did provide some caveats when handing over a Razer Blade 16 to test. It's a thinner model than previous years—likely one of the thinnest gaming laptops with an RTX 5090 at the least. Razer had to shave off an extra 15 watts of total graphics power (TGP) to get it this tiny, meaning this laptop isn't the best showcase for the 5090's maximum performance. That said, Nvidia is no doubt proud to show off an RTX 5090 in a chassis that's just 0.59 inches at its thinnest. The Blade also uses the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU instead of the beefier Intel chip in last year’s model.\nBut we're about to be inundated with gaming laptops with graphics cards up to the RTX 5090. Unlike the RTX 5090 desktop GPU, it won't be sold out and impossible to find at a decent price. Speaking of, it's important to know that although it shares a name, the laptop version of the RTX 5090 doesn't sit in the same category as the corresponding desktop GPU. Instead, it's built on the same GPU (GB203) as the desktop RTX 5080. The mismatched naming has been used for the past few generations, despite the confusion it creates.\nOne important change this year is that the laptop RTX 5090 comes with 24 GB of video random access memory (VRAM), sliding right between the two desktop GPUs in memory capacity. VRAM stores graphics data, and the more you have available, the smoother the graphics. This is the most VRAM we've ever seen on a laptop, even more than what you get in the $999 RTX 5080 desktop GPU. Given how sensitive newer games are to RAM usage these days, this should expand what’s possible and address one of the major complaints about the desktop RTX 5080.\nIn 3DMark tests, the mobile RTX 5090 lands just ahead of the desktop RTX 4070 Super, released at the beginning of 2024. Disappointingly, it doesn’t even offer a clear step up over 2023’s mobile RTX 4090. The extra memory will help quite a bit in specific games, but in all my 3DMark benchmarks, the RTX 5090 doesn’t have a clear victory over its predecessor.\nBut we live in strange times. With the RTX 5090, the primary question is not how good the raw performance is, but whether or not multi-frame generation lives up to the hype. As part of Deep Learning Super Sampling 4 (DLSS), it’s the primary feature Nvidia is selling the 50-series cards on, boasting that you can get RTX 4090 performance on a $1,300 laptop. Is that true? We might not know until the budget-tier mobile GPUs come out, but all the technology is in place to try it out on the RTX 5090 that’s now available.\nIt’s All About Multi-Frame Generation\nFrame generation was a big deal when it launched in DLSS 3. Using predictive AI, DLSS can generate an artificial frame between every two rendered frames, greatly improving frame rates, powered by the GPU’s new Tensor cores. Multi-frame generation takes things a step further, letting you generate two or even three artificial frames for every two rendered frames. Nvidia says that equates to up to eight times the performance.\nAs has often been true with DLSS, performance comes at a price in visual quality. Put simply, the more fake frames you add, especially to much lower frame rates, the more the image quality degrades. Frame generation works as promised, and when you stare at just the numbers, it’s impressive. If you are after those higher frame rate numbers, adding new frames to the game improves smoothness for sure, though maybe not to the degree you might expect. Generated frames don't feel the same as native ones. The numbers get bigger as promised, but the more extra frames you add, the more input lag is inserted into the equation.\nCyberpunk 2077 is the most noteworthy example right now, hyped up for its all-in ray tracing features and native implementation of multi-frame generation. I tested the game on the Blade 16’s native 2,560 x 1,600-pixel resolution in the Ray Tracing Overdrive mode, tweaking the multi-frame generation as I went. In 2X multi-frame generation mode under the Quality setting, the RTX 5090 averaged 82 frames per second (fps). That jumped up to 115 fps in the 3X mode, making better use of the 240-Hz screen refresh rate on the Razer Blade 16.\nYou can get even more juice from frame generation by changing DLSS to the Performance setting. In the past, I would have never recommended such a thing. But with DLSS 4, there have been huge improvements to image quality with the new Transformer model. It’s exposed as a toggle in Cyberpunk 2077 (unlike in other games), so you can compare screenshots side by side to see the difference. Shadows are more realistic, text looks sharper, and there are fewer AI artifacts and oversharpening.\nDon’t get me wrong—the changes overall are still subtle. If you’re familiar with DLSS, you know that even in its new iterations, image quality can suffer, especially if you venture outside of Quality mode. Let your eyes wander toward the edges of the frame or to objects in the distance, and you’ll see garbled text, warped edges, and low-resolution textures. It’s not perfect, but the Transformer model polishes most of these errors.\nThe Wider Picture\nThat’s just one game. I also tested Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Star Wars Outlaws, Black Myth: Wukong, and Marvel Rivals. Except for Wukong, these games also had native implementations of DLSS 4, but remain some of the select few.\nNvidia has a way around the limited number of games that support it. In the Nvidia app, you can override a game’s settings to support 2X, 3X, or 4X frame generation. That’s how Nvidia achieves its claim of over 100 supported games and apps. While that works for testing, it’s incredibly cumbersome to use. The amount of frame generation you want to use will depend on the game, requiring multiple restarts until you’re happy with the result. Hopefully, this buys time for developers to add the setting in games, but for now, I don’t think it’s something many gamers will use.\nIndiana Jones and The Great Circle was the most convincing example of DLSS 4. While you can play Cyberpunk 2077 maxed out with standard 2X frame generation at decent frame rates, things are even better with The Great Circle. You’ll average only around 60 fps in Supreme mode with full path-traced lighting effects, and without frame generation at all, you’re in the 40s. The 3X or 4X gets you that buttery frame-rate gaming experience without turning down ray tracing.\nArtificially adding frames is less useful if you primarily play fast-paced competitive games like Marvel Rivals. You might assume that higher frame rates—even if they’re artificially generated—mean smoother action. The game might look better, but as any competitive player will tell you, the trade-off in input delay just isn’t worth it. The input delay is noticeable in slower-paced games but doesn't impact gameplay nearly as much.\nThat said, I don’t mind that Nvidia has opened the sandbox and is allowing gamers to tweak settings using the override functionality in the Nvidia app. More options and customization to suit your PC, budget, and specific game are what PC gaming is all about, after all. I just wish this card had more raw compute to back up multi-frame generation.\nDoes It Make for a Good Laptop?\nMost of what I’ve said applies equally to desktop GPUs as it does to laptops. But Nvidia also boasts the heightened efficiency of the RTX 5090 to help with battery life. Max-Q is Nvidia’s tech to improve efficiency and battery life, and there are a few key optimizations, like voltage for the GDDR7 memory, and a new Low Latency Sleep feature to turn off the GPU faster.\nNvidia is promising up to an extra hour of battery life while gaming. I can’t do a one-for-one comparison with an exact previous model, but I tried out Balanced mode on battery, which quieted down the system a bit yet gave the laptop enough power to produce a smooth enough 60 fps in Marvel Rivals. I was surprised by how well the system balanced noise, heat, performance, and battery, but I still only got around an hour and a half of playtime before it died. That’s a step in the right direction, though I wouldn’t say it’s game-changing.\nA lot more can be said about these individual laptops as they launch. These top-of-the-line models should only be reserved for people interested in experiencing the best ray tracing in the latest titles. The broader support for multi-frame generation may be more useful on the lower-tier laptops when they come out later this year, offering a better gaming experience without paying a premium. Larger systems may be able to take full advantage of what the RTX 5090 can offer.\nBut tested in a thin laptop like the Razer Blade 16, the mobile RTX 5090 doesn’t quite feel like the next-gen GPU refresh it should be.",

Put simply, the more fake frames you add, especially to much lower frame rates, the more the image quality degrades. Frame generation works as promised, and when you stare at just the numbers, it’s impressive. If you are after those higher frame rate numbers, adding new frames to the game improves smoothness for sure, though maybe not to the degree you might expect. Generated frames don't feel the same as native ones. The numbers get bigger as promised, but the more extra frames you add, the more input lag is inserted into the equation.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is the most noteworthy example right now, hyped up for its all-in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/should-anyone-actually-care-about-ray-tracing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ray tracing features</a> and native implementation of multi-frame generation.

    "content_text": "“Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!” With a sly grin that I’d soon come to recognize, Paul Ginsparg quoted Michael Corleone from The Godfather. Ginsparg, a physics professor at Cornell University and a certified MacArthur genius, may have little in common with Al Pacino’s mafia don, but both are united by the feeling that they were denied a graceful exit from what they’ve built.\nNearly 35 years ago, Ginsparg created arXiv, a digital repository where researchers could share their latest findings—before those findings had been systematically reviewed or verified. Visit arXiv.org today (it’s pronounced like “archive”) and you’ll still see its old-school Web 1.0 design, featuring a red banner and the seal of Cornell University, the platform’s institutional home. But arXiv’s unassuming facade belies the tectonic reconfiguration it set off in the scientific community. If arXiv were to stop functioning, scientists from every corner of the planet would suffer an immediate and profound disruption. “Everybody in math and physics uses it,” Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. “I scan it every night.”\nEvery industry has certain problems universally acknowledged as broken: insurance in health care, licensing in music, standardized testing in education, tipping in the restaurant business. In academia, it’s publishing. Academic publishing is dominated by for-profit giants like Elsevier and Springer. Calling their practice a form of thuggery isn’t so much an insult as an economic observation. Imagine if a book publisher demanded that authors write books for free and, instead of employing in-house editors, relied on other authors to edit those books, also for free. And not only that: The final product was then sold at prohibitively expensive prices to ordinary readers, and institutions were forced to pay exorbitant fees for access.\nThe “free editing” academic publishers facilitate is called peer review, the process by which fellow researchers vet new findings. This can take months, even a year. But with arXiv, scientists could post their papers—known, at this unvetted stage, as preprints—for instant and free access to everyone. One of arXiv’s great achievements was “showing that you could divorce the actual transmission of your results from the process of refereeing,” said Paul Fendley, an early arXiv moderator and now a physicist at All Souls College, Oxford. During crises like the Covid pandemic, time-sensitive breakthroughs were disseminated quickly—particularly by bioRxiv and medRxiv, platforms inspired by arXiv—potentially saving, by one study’s estimate, millions of lives.\nWhile arXiv submissions aren’t peer-reviewed, they are moderated by experts in each field, who volunteer their time to ensure that submissions meet basic academic standards and follow arXiv’s guidelines: original research only, no falsified data, sufficiently neutral language. Submissions also undergo automated checks for baseline quality control. Without these, pseudoscientific papers and amateur work would flood the platform.\nIn 2021, the journal Nature declared arXiv one of the “10 computer codes that transformed science,” praising its role in fostering scientific collaboration. (The article is behind a paywall—unlock it for $199 a year.) By a recent count, arXiv hosts more than 2.6 million papers, receives 20,000 new submissions each month, and has 5 million monthly active users. Many of the most significant discoveries of the 21st century have first appeared on the platform. The “transformers” paper that launched the modern AI boom? Uploaded to arXiv. Same with the solution to the Poincaré conjecture, one of the seven Millennium Prize problems, famous for their difficulty and $1 million rewards. Just because a paper is posted on arXiv doesn’t mean it won’t appear in a prestigious journal someday, but it’s often where research makes its debut and stays openly available. The transformers paper is still routinely accessed via arXiv.\nFor scientists, imagining a world without arXiv is like the rest of us imagining one without public libraries or GPS. But a look at its inner workings reveals that it isn’t a frictionless utopia of open-access knowledge. Over the years, arXiv’s permanence has been threatened by everything from bureaucratic strife to outdated code to even, once, a spy scandal. In the words of Ginsparg, who usually redirects interview requests to an FAQ document—on arXiv, no less—and tried to talk me out of visiting him in person, arXiv is “a child I sent off to college but who keeps coming back to camp out in my living room, behaving badly.”\nGinsparg and I met over the course of several days last spring in Ithaca, New York, home of Cornell University. I’ll admit, I was apprehensive ahead of our time together. Geoffrey West, a former supervisor of Ginsparg’s at Los Alamos National Laboratory, once described him as “quite a character” who is “infamous in the community” for being “quite difficult.” He also said he was “extremely funny” and a “great guy.” In our early email exchanges, Ginsparg told me, upfront, that stories about arXiv never impress him: “So many articles, so few insights,” he wrote.\nAt 69 years old, Ginsparg has the lean build of a retired triathlete, his knees etched with scars collected over a lifetime of hiking, mountain climbing, and cycling. (He still leads hikes on occasion, leaving younger scientists struggling to keep up.) His attire was always relaxed, as though he’d just stepped off the Camino de Santiago, making my already casual clothes seem overdressy. Much of our time together was spent cycling the town’s rolling hills, and the maximum speed on the ebike I rented could not keep up with his efficient pedaling.\nInvited one afternoon to Ginsparg’s office in Cornell’s physics building, I discovered it to be not “messy,” per se, because that suggests it could be cleaned. Instead, the objects in the room seemed inert, long since resigned to their fate: unopened boxes from the 1990s, piles of Physics Today magazines, an inexplicable CRT monitor, a tossed-aside invitation to the Obama White House. New items were occasionally added to the heap. I spotted a copy of Stephen Wolfram’s recent book, The Second Law, with a note from Wolfram that read, “Since you can’t find it on arXiv :)” The only thing that seemed actively in use was the blackboard, dense with symbols and equations related to quantum measurement theory, sprawling with bra-ket notation.\nAs he showed me around the building and his usual haunts, Ginsparg was gregarious, not letting a single detail slip by: the nesting patterns of local red-tailed hawks, the comings and goings of the dining staff, the plans for a new building going up behind his office. He was playful, even prankish. Midway through telling me about a podcast he was listening to, Ginsparg suddenly stopped and said, “I like your hair color, by the way, it works for you”—my hair is dyed ash gray, if anyone cares—before seamlessly transitioning to a story about a hard drive that had failed him.\nThe drive, which he had sent for recovery, contained a language model, Ginsparg’s latest intellectual fascination. Among his litany of peeves is that, because arXiv has seen a surge in submissions in recent times, especially in the AI category, the number of low-quality papers has followed a similar curve—and arXiv has nowhere near enough volunteers to vet them all. Hence his fussing with the drive, part of a quest to catch subpar submissions with what he calls “the holy grail crackpot filter.” And Ginsparg thinks, as he often has in arXiv’s three-decade history, that the quality would not be up to snuff if he doesn’t do it himself.\nLong before arXiv became critical infrastructure for scientific research, it was a collection of shell scripts running on Ginsparg’s NeXT machine. In June 1991, Ginsparg, then a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, attended a conference in Colorado, where a fateful encounter took place.\nFirst came a remark from Joanne Cohn, a friend of Ginsparg’s and a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, who maintained a mailing list for physics preprints. At the time, there was no centralized way to access these preprints. Unless researchers were on certain mailing lists—which were predicated on their affiliations with prestigious institutions—or knew exactly whom to contact via email, they had to wait months to read new work in published journals.\nThen came an offhand comment from a physicist worried about his computer’s storage filling up with emailed articles while he was traveling.\nGinsparg, who had been coding since high school, asked Cohn if she’d considered automating the distribution process. She hadn’t and told him to go ahead and do it himself. “My recollection is that the next day he’d come up with the scripts and seemed pretty happy about having done it so quickly,” Cohn told me. “It’s hard to communicate how different it was at the time. Paul had really seen ahead.”\nHearing tales from and about Ginsparg, you can’t help but see him as a sort of Forrest Gump figure of the internet age, who found himself at crucial junctures and crossed paths with revolutionary figures. As an undergrad at Harvard, he was classmates with Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer; his older brother was a graduate student at Stanford studying with Terry Winograd, an AI pioneer. The brothers both had email addresses and access to Arpanet, the precursor to the internet, at a time when few others did.\nAfter earning his PhD in theoretical physics at Cornell, Ginsparg began teaching at Harvard. A career there wasn’t to be: He wasn’t granted tenure—Harvard is infamous for this—and started looking for a job elsewhere. That’s when Ginsparg was recruited to Los Alamos, where he was free to do research on theoretical high-energy physics full-time, without other responsibilities. Plus, New Mexico was perfect for his active lifestyle.\nWhen arXiv started, it wasn’t a website but an automated email server (and within a few months also an FTP server). Then Ginsparg heard about something called the “World Wide Web.” Initially skeptical—“I can’t really pay attention to every single fad”—he became intrigued when the Mosaic browser was released in 1993. Soon after, Ginsparg built a web interface for arXiv, which over time became its primary mode of access. He also occasionally consulted with a programmer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) named Tim Berners-Lee—now Sir Tim “Inventor of the World Wide Web” Berners-Lee—whom Ginsparg fondly credits with grilling excellent swordfish at his home in the French countryside.\nIn 1994, with a National Science Foundation grant, Ginsparg hired two people to transform arXiv’s shell scripts into more reliable Perl code. They were both technically gifted, perhaps too gifted to stay for long. One of them, Mark Doyle, later joined the American Physical Society and became its chief information officer. The other, Rob Hartill, was working simultaneously on a project to collect entertainment data: the Internet Movie Database. (After IMDb, Hartill went on to do notable work at the Apache Software Foundation.)\nBefore arXiv was called arXiv, it was accessed under the hostname xxx.lanl.gov (“xxx” didn’t have the explicit connotations it does today, Ginsparg emphasized). During a car ride, he and his wife brainstormed nicer-sounding names. Archive? Already taken. Maybe they could sub in the Greek equivalent of X, chi (pronounced like “kai”). “She wrote it down and crossed out the e to make it more symmetric around the X,” Ginsparg said. “So arXiv it was.” At this point, there wasn’t much formal structure. The number of developers typically stayed at one or two, and much of the moderation was managed by Ginsparg’s friends, acquaintances, and colleagues.\nEarly on, Ginsparg expected to receive on the order of 100 submissions to arXiv a year. It turned out to be closer to 100 a month, and growing. “Day one, something happened, day two something happened, day three, Ed Witten posted a paper,” as Ginsparg once put it. “That was when the entire community joined.” Edward Witten is a revered string theorist and, quite possibly, the smartest person alive. “The arXiv enabled much more rapid worldwide communication among physicists,” Witten wrote to me in an email. Over time, disciplines such as mathematics and computer science were added, and Ginsparg began to appreciate the significance of this new electronic medium. Plus, he said, “it was fun.”\nAs the usage grew, arXiv faced challenges similar to those of other large software systems, particularly in scaling and moderation. There were slowdowns to deal with, like the time arXiv was hit by too much traffic from “stanford.edu.” The culprits? Sergey Brin and Larry Page, who were then busy indexing the web for what would eventually become Google. Years later, when Ginsparg visited Google HQ, both Brin and Page personally apologized to him for the incident.\nThe biggest mystery is not why arXiv succeeded. Rather, it’s how it wasn’t killed by vested interests intent on protecting traditional academic publishing. Perhaps this was due to a decision Ginsparg made early on: Upon submission, users signed a clause that gave arXiv nonexclusive license to distribute the work in perpetuity, even in the event of future publication elsewhere. The strategic move ensured that no major publishers, known for their typically aggressive actions to maintain feudal control, would ever seriously attempt to shut it down.\nBut even as arXiv’s influence grew, higher-ups at Los Alamos never particularly championed the project—which was becoming, one could argue, more influential than the lab itself. (This was, of course, long past the heyday of Oppenheimer depicted in Christopher Nolan’s middling 2023 docudrama.) Those early years at Los Alamos were “dreamlike and heavenly,” Ginsparg emphasized, the best job he ever had. But in 1999, a fellow physicist at the lab, Wen Ho Lee, was accused of leaking classified information to China. Lee, a Taiwanese American, was later cleared of wrongdoing, and the case was widely criticized for racial profiling. At the time, the scandal led to internal upheaval. There were travel restrictions to prevent leaks, and even discussions about subjecting employees to lie detector tests. “It just got glummer and glummer,” Ginsparg said. It didn’t help that a performance review that year labeled him “a strictly average performer” with “no particular computer skills contributing to lab programs.” Also, his daughter had just been born, and there weren’t schools nearby. He was ready to leave.\nGinsparg stops short of saying he “brought” arXiv with him, but the fact is, he ended up back at his alma mater, Cornell—tenured, this time—and so did arXiv. He vowed to be free of the project within “five years maximum.” After all, his main job wasn’t supposed to be running arXiv—it was teaching and doing research. At the university, arXiv found a home within the library. “They disseminate material to academics,” Ginsparg said, “so that seemed like a natural fit.”\nA natural fit it was not. Under the hood, arXiv was a complex software platform that required technical expertise far beyond what was typically available in a university library. The logic for the submission process alone involved a vast number of potential scenarios and edge cases, making the code convoluted. Ginsparg and other early arXiv members I spoke to felt that the library failed to grasp arXiv’s significance and treated it more like an afterthought.\nOn the library’s side, some people thought Ginsparg was too hands-on. Others said he wasn’t patient enough. A “good lower-level manager,” according to someone long involved with arXiv, “but his sense of management didn’t scale.” For most of the 2000s, arXiv couldn’t hold on to more than a few developers.\nThere are two paths for pioneers of computing. One is a life of board seats, keynote speeches, and lucrative consulting gigs. The other is the path of the practitioner who remains hands-on, still writing and reviewing code. It’s clear where Ginsparg stands—and how anathema the other path is to him. As he put it to me, “Larry Summers spending one day a week consulting for some hedge fund—it’s just unseemly.”\nBut overstaying one’s welcome also risks unseemliness. By the mid-2000s, as the web matured, arXiv—in the words of its current program director, Stephanie Orphan—got “bigger than all of us.” A creationist physicist sued it for rejecting papers on creationist cosmology. Various other mini-scandals arose, including a plagiarism one, and some users complained that the moderators—volunteers who are experts in their respective fields—held too much power. In 2009, Philip Gibbs, an independent physicist, even created viXra (arXiv spelled backward), a more or less unregulated Wild West where papers on quantum-physico-homeopathy can find their readership, for anyone eager to learn why pi is a lie.\nThen there was the problem of managing arXiv’s massive code base. Although Ginsparg was a capable programmer, he wasn’t a software professional adhering to industry norms like maintainability and testing. Much like constructing a building without proper structural supports or routine safety checks, his methods allowed for quick initial progress but later caused delays and complications. Unrepentant, Ginsparg often went behind the library’s back to check the code for errors. The staff saw this as an affront, accusing him of micromanaging and sowing distrust.\nIn 2011, arXiv’s 20th anniversary, Ginsparg thought he was ready to move on, writing what was intended as a farewell note, an article titled “ArXiv at 20,” in Nature: “For me, the repository was supposed to be a three-hour tour, not a life sentence. ArXiv was originally conceived to be fully automated, so as not to scuttle my research career. But daily administrative activities associated with running it can consume hours of every weekday, year-round without holiday.”\nGinsparg would stay on the advisory board, but daily operations would be handed over to the staff at the Cornell University Library.\nIt never happened, and as time went on, some accused Ginsparg of “backseat driving.” One person said he was holding certain code “hostage” by refusing to share it with other employees or on GitHub. Ginsparg was frustrated because he couldn’t understand why implementing features that used to take him a day now took weeks. I challenged him on this, asking if there was any documentation for developers to onboard the new code base. Ginsparg responded, “I learned Fortran in the 1960s, and real programmers didn’t document,” which nearly sent me, a coder, into cardiac arrest.\nTechnical problems were compounded by administrative ones. In 2019, Cornell transferred arXiv to the school’s Computing and Information Science division, only to have it change hands again after a few months. Then a new director with a background in, of all things, for-profit academic publishing took over; she lasted a year and a half. “There was disruption,” said an arXiv employee. “It was not a good period.”\nBut finally, relief: In 2022, the Simons Foundation committed funding that allowed arXiv to go on a hiring spree. Ramin Zabih, a Cornell professor who had been a long-time champion, joined as the faculty director. Under the new governance structure, arXiv’s migration to the cloud and a refactoring of the code base to Python finally took off.\nOne Saturday morning, I met Ginsparg at his home. He was carefully inspecting his son’s bike, which I was borrowing for a three-hour ride we had planned to Mount Pleasant. As Ginsparg shared the route with me, he teasingly—but persistently—expressed doubts about my ability to keep up. I was tempted to mention that, in high school, I’d cycled solo across Japan, but I refrained and silently savored the moment when, on the final uphill later that day, he said, “I might’ve oversold this to you.”\nOver the months I spoke with Ginsparg, my main challenge was interrupting him, as a simple question would often launch him into an extended monolog. It was only near the end of the bike ride that I managed to tell him how I found him tenacious and stubborn, and that if someone more meek had been in charge, arXiv might not have survived. I was startled by his response.\n“You know, one person’s tenacity is another person’s terrorism,” he said.\n“What do you mean?” I asked.\n“I’ve heard that the staff occasionally felt terrorized,” he said.\n“By you?” I replied, though a more truthful response would’ve been “No shit.” Ginsparg apparently didn’t hear the question and started talking about something else.\nBeyond the drama—if not terrorism—of its day-to-day operations, arXiv still faces many challenges. The linguist Emily Bender has accused it of being a “cancer” for the way it promotes “junk science” and “fast scholarship.” Sometimes it does seem too fast: In 2023, a much-hyped paper claiming to have cracked room-temperature superconductivity turned out to be thoroughly wrong. (But equally fast was exactly that debunking—proof of arXiv working as intended.) Then there are opposite cases, where arXiv “censors”—so say critics—perfectly good findings, such as when physicist Jorge Hirsch, of h-index fame, had his paper withdrawn for “inflammatory content” and “unprofessional language.”\nHow does Ginsparg feel about all this? Well, he’s not the type to wax poetic about having a mission, promoting an ideology, or being a pioneer of “open science.” He cares about those things, I think, but he’s reluctant to frame his work in grandiose ways.\nAt one point, I asked if he ever really wants to be liberated from arXiv. “You know, I have to be completely honest—there are various aspects of this that remain incredibly entertaining,” Ginsparg said. “I have the perfect platform for testing ideas and playing with them.” Though he no longer tinkers with the production code that runs arXiv, he is still hard at work on his holy grail for filtering out bogus submissions. It’s a project that keeps him involved, keeps him active. Perhaps, with newer language models, he’ll figure it out. “It’s like that Al Pacino quote: They keep bringing me back,” he said. A familiar smile spread across Ginsparg’s face. “But Al Pacino also developed a real taste for killing people.”\nLet us know what you think about this article.

    "content_text": "Schrödinger’s cat, quantum entanglement—the songs on Hikaru Utada’s latest album, Science Fiction, go deeper into the singer-songwriter’s “fascination with science” than they ever have before. Part greatest-hits collection, part reflection on interests they have cultivated for many years, it’s a body of work that shows their breadth as an artist. It only seemed fitting, then, that WIRED Japan would invite Utada to Switzerland to visit CERN, one of the world’s leading research centers for particle physics, an invitation they quickly accepted.\n“CERN is a place I have dreamed of visiting for the past 10 years or so,” Utada says. “To be honest, being able to go there and talk to the scientists and see the particle accelerator might be even better than performing on the main stage at Coachella [laughs]. I definitely wanted to go.”\nCERN is the world’s largest particle physics laboratory, located on the border between Switzerland and France. Its iconic Large Hadron Collider (LHC)—a gigantic circular accelerator with a circumference of 27 kilometers—made its name in 2012 when it discovered the Higgs boson, the mysterious particle that continues to play a key role in experiments into the origins of the universe.\nThe center’s work is not limited to research about how the universe began and the behavior of subatomic particles; it can also lead to advances that have greater impacts on everyday life. For example, in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist who was then working at CERN, developed a system to provide decentralized, real-time access to information within the organization. It became the foundation for the World Wide Web.\nIn recent years, the organization has also been proactively engaged in outreach efforts that fuse art and science. That’s why University of Tokyo physicist Junichi Tanaka and Kazuki Kojima, a researcher at KEK (High Energy Accelerator Research Organization) are here. CERN asked the Japanese scientists to accompany Utada and WIRED on our CERN visit. Utada asked the two of them more questions than anyone else. While standing in front of ATLAS (the large general-purpose particle detector located 100 meters under the main CERN campus that detects and measures particles accelerated and collided by the LHC), the conversation around the topic of dark matter was a lively one.\nUtada: What are you most focused on pursuing at the moment?\nKojima: There is a theory in particle physics called the Standard Model, but it can only explain about 5 percent of the mass and energy in the universe. In fact, it is thought that about 26 percent of the mass and energy in the universe is dark matter, and the remaining 70 percent is dark energy. Regardless of dark energy, we know that dark matter exists, but we don't know what it is, and we are currently searching to understand its true nature.\nUtada: Dark energy is …\nKojima: We know almost nothing about it.\nTanaka: You could say it’s a name that was almost given at random.\nUtada: OK, so “dark” here doesn’t mean “not lit,” but rather “unknowable” or “unknown.”\nTanaka: We don’t know anything about dark energy. It has that name because the universe is expanding. But dark matter can be explained by gravity, so we believe it exists. But it’s hard to find it. We’re trying to measure something when we don't know what it is, so we spend a great deal of time conducting experiments.\nUtada: It’s like proving the existence of something by the absence of something else.\nKojima: Yes, that’s right.\nUtada: It’s like trying to prove the existence of an invisible man. A room with capacity for 10 people is packed even though there are only nine people there. Or there were 10 people in the room, but traces of 11 people coming from it.\nTanaka Yes, yes, that’s the idea!\nIt’s a matter of making an analogy to something else or replacing one relationship with another. Utada says they attach a special importance to this act. This means that they regularly transform what exists only in their own mind into clever metaphors by making full use of the knowledge and experience they have cultivated over time, and the words and symbols derived from their intuition. They then diligently carry out the task of communicating these to others.\n“When I compared dark matter to an invisible man, I was really happy to hear Tanaka and Kojima say, ‘Oh, that's right!’” Utada says.\nAnother thing that made an impression on Utada was the pair’s response to their question about what they’d want to convey to the general public who are not experts in science. “Tanaka thought for a while and then said, ‘I guess it would be that there is still so much we don’t know.’ I thought that was really wonderful,” Utada says.\nBut it’s even deeper than that. “I think the ‘knowledge of ignorance,’ feeling truly excited by the fact that there are things we don’t yet know or don’t understand, is a very important perspective,” Utada says. “Fear comes from ignorance, doesn’t it? It is human instinct to fear the dark. It’s because we don’t know that we feel fear, discrimination, prejudice, violence, and more. So what is the opposite of that? I think it’s curiosity and a spirit of inquiry.”\nThis story is an excerpt of a piece from WIRED Japan's Quantumpedia March issue.\nSpecial thanks to: Presence Switzerland (Federal Department of Foreign Affairs), embassy of Switzerland in Japan, Switzerland tourism, CERN, Geneva tourism, hotel president Wilson Junichi Tanaka (The University of Tokyo), Kazuki Kojima (KEK), Masato Aoki (KEK), Tomoyuki Saito (The University of Tokyo), Nozomu Kaji (Sony Music Labels, Inc.), Mina Okachi (Sony Music Labels, Inc.), Akihico Mori styling by Kyohei Ogawa, hair and makeup by Hisano Komine, project coordination by Erina Anscomb.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nVivaldi Technologies has announced a new partnership with Proton AG that will integrate the free version of Proton VPN into Vivaldi's web browser, allowing every user a quick and easy way to access a virtual private network (VPN).\nA VPN protects users’ privacy by hiding their real IP address. It acts like a protective tunnel, allowing users to pass through a public network without anyone being able to snoop on their data, whether that's a scammer at the coffee shop or a data-gathering behemoth like Google.\nVivaldi and Proton VPN have positioned the partnership as a “challenge to the dominance of US Big Tech giants,” according to the press release. Vivaldi CEO Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner has long been a critic of the surveillance capitalism model, as far back as his previous browser company, Opera. David Peterson, general manager of Proton VPN, goes further, saying, “Together, Proton VPN and Vivaldi are setting a new standard that challenges the dominance of tech giants, providing a viable European alternative that helps people retake control of their digital lives.” Vivaldi is a Norwegian company, and Proton is based in Switzerland.\nVivaldi, which I've previously called the web's best browser, is already full of privacy features you won't find elsewhere, like an integrated ad blocker, which isn't as robust as what you'll get from add-ons like uBlock, but is nevertheless sufficient for most users, and most importantly, right there in the browser. It also offers integrations with privacy-friendlier search engines like Brave and StartPage (though neither is the default). Vivaldi also has a full email client, calendar, and RSS reader. The new Proton VPN integration fits well with Vivaldi's all-in-one philosophy. Like the other features, if you aren't interested, the new Proton VPN integration stays out of the way.\nProton VPN has long topped our Best VPNs guide for its robust security, along with an excellent privacy record and no-logs policy. Proton VPN has been independently audited and maintains a warrant canary page. It has long had the best free VPN offering, which is what's being integrated into Vivaldi. Unlike most services, Proton VPN's free version gives full access to all the regular plan's features.

    "content_text": "A Venmo account under the name “Michael Waltz,” carrying a profile photo of the national security adviser and connected to accounts bearing the names of people closely associated with him, was left open to the public until Wednesday afternoon. A WIRED analysis shows that the account revealed the names of hundreds of Waltz’s personal and professional associates, including journalists, military officers, lobbyists, and others—information a foreign intelligence service or other actors could exploit for any number of ends, experts say.\nAmong the accounts linked to “Michael Waltz” are ones that appear to belong to Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, and Walker Barrett, a staffer on the United States National Security Council. Both were fellow participants in a now-infamous Signal group chat called “Houthi PC small group.”\nThe White House declined to comment after being presented with WIRED’s findings, but the accounts appearing to belong to Waltz and Wiles went fully private following WIRED’s inquiry.\nEarlier this week, The Atlantic reported that an account with the name “Michael Waltz” accidentally invited the publication’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to the chat, in which senior administration officials discussed plans for a strike on Yemen. (Waltz told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham he takes “full responsibility” for inviting Goldberg, adding, “We have some of the best technology minds looking at how this happened.”) Over the encrypted messaging app, which Department of Defense guidelines bar from being used for the discussion of any nonpublic defense information, the group debated whether a strike should be carried out at all. Hours after an account with the name of defense secretary Pete Hegseth shared missile targets, strike timing, and other highly sensitive operational details of a coming strike, US forces bombed Houthi targets in Yemen, reportedly killing at least 53 people.\nA WIRED review of public data exposed on Venmo accounts associated with senior administration officials suggests that the Signal group chat was not an isolated mistake, but part of a broader pattern of what national security experts describe as reckless behavior by some of the most powerful people in the US government.\nThe Venmo account under Waltz’s name includes a 328-person friend list. Among them are accounts sharing the names of people closely associated with Waltz, such as Barrett, formerly Waltz’s deputy chief of staff when Waltz was a member of the House of Representatives, and Micah Thomas Ketchel, former chief of staff to Waltz and currently a senior adviser to Waltz and President Donald Trump.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at dmehro.89 or timmarchman.01.\nOther accounts carry the names of a wide range of media figures, from on-air personalities like Bret Baier and Brian Kilmeade of Fox News and Brianna Keilar and Kristen Holmes of CNN to a cable news producer, a prominent national security reporter, local news anchors, documentarians, and noted conspiracy theorist Ivan Raiklin, who calls himself the “the secretary of retribution” and once created a deep state target list. (Fox News declined to comment; CNN did not respond to a request for comment.)\nMany of the accounts appear to belong to local and national politicians and political operatives ranging from US representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas to a former mayor of Deltona, Florida, as well as venture capitalists, defense industry entrepreneurs, and executives like Christian Brose, the president of defense tech giant Anduril. (Crenshaw’s office and Anduril did not respond to requests for comment.)\nOne of the most notable appears to belong to Wiles, one of Trump’s most trusted political advisers. That account’s 182-person friend list includes accounts sharing the names of influential figures like Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, and Hope Hicks, Trump’s former White House communications director.\nWhile none of the Venmo transactions for the account listed for Waltz, Wiles, or Barrett were publicly visible, it appears that none of them had opted out of sharing their contact list, allowing their friend lists to remain visible to the public. After WIRED reached out to the White House for comment, both Waltz and Wiles appeared to change their Venmo privacy settings to hide their friend lists.\nVenmo spokesperson Erin Mackey said in a statement, “We take our customers’ privacy seriously, which is why we let customers choose their privacy settings on Venmo for both their individual payments and friends lists—and we make it incredibly simple for customers to make these private if they choose to do so.” The comment is nearly identical to the one Venmo provided to WIRED in response to a 2024 story about now-vice president JD Vance’s Venmo.\nLast July, WIRED reported that Vance had left his Venmo account public, exposing a network of connections to Project 2025 architects, DOJ officials, Yale Law classmates, and far-right media figures. (While it was not reported at the time, WIRED’s analysis of that public Venmo account—and the networks of his listed friends—found that the Michael Waltz Venmo account appeared in Vance’s extended network, comprising friends and friends of friends.) According to The Atlantic, Vance was also an active participant in the Signal chat alongside Waltz, where he questioned whether the planned military operation in Yemen aligned with President Trump’s broader message on Europe.\nWhen the Michael Waltz account was set up in 2017, the app would display a prompt allowing users to sync their phone contacts, automatically populating their friends list with anyone in their address book already using the platform. Privacy advocates, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, criticized this design, arguing that it exposes users to unnecessary risks by making social connections public by default. It wasn’t until BuzzFeed News revealed in 2021 that then-president Joe Biden was easily found on the app that Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, added the option to hide friend lists. But that setting remains opt-in. According to its privacy policy, unless users proactively change their privacy settings, their network remains visible to anyone.\nMixed in with the high-profile names connected to the apparent Waltz Venmo account are a number of accounts appearing to belong to ordinary people, such as several doctors, real estate agents, and a tailor. These are the kinds of low-level connections that, experts say, spies look at for basic information—a relationship with a medical specialist could expose that a person is being treated for an illness that hasn’t been made public—as well as patterns, pressure points, or a way in. Experts call them “soft targets”: people who have access but aren’t protected.\nFor instance, when the US and Israel reportedly sabotaged Iran’s nuclear program with the Stuxnet virus, they used a control engineer’s USB stick, not one belonging to a senior official. Chinese intelligence has used similar tactics, contacting thousands of foreign citizens using LinkedIn or going after university students to get closer to US researchers and companies. While WIRED has found no evidence that foreign adversaries have used Venmo to target a US politician’s network, the platform makes these relationships visible—potentially giving adversaries a searchable map of the people around power.\n“The first thing you think of is the counterintelligence issue, right? And the security vulnerabilities. It kind of boggles the mind, in a way,” says Michael Ard, a former intelligence analyst who now runs the masters program in intelligence analysis at Johns Hopkins. “It would be really easy for somebody to spoof a contact, and that is something the security industry has already been issuing notices on.”\nWaltz has spent years inside the Republican national security establishment. A former Green Beret—something reflected in the number of apparent veteran Green Berets, Navy SEALs, and other special operators to whom the Venmo account bearing his name is connected—he served as a defense adviser at the Pentagon under former defense secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates, and later counseled US vice president Dick Cheney on counterterrorism. In 2020, following the US drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, Waltz says he was part of a small group of lawmakers privately briefed at the White House.\nAnother participant in that thread was Hegseth. A public Venmo account under his name, identified by The American Prospect in February, revealed a similarly elite network—including names matching executives at defense firms like Palantir and Anduril as well as lobbyists and President George W. Bush–era officials. In the Signal chat, the defense secretary directly responded to Vance’s concerns: “VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.”\nBoth Vance’s and Hegseth’s Venmo accounts have since been deleted.\nJake Lahut contributed reporting.",

    "content_text": "The eye-popping scandal surrounding the Trump cabinet’s accidental invitation to The Atlantic’s editor in chief to join a text-message group secretly planning a bombing in Yemen has rolled into its third day, and that controversy now has a name: SignalGate, a reference to the fact that the conversation took place on the end-to-end encrypted free messaging tool Signal.\nAs that name becomes a shorthand for the biggest public blunder of the second Trump administration to date, however, security and privacy experts who have promoted Signal as the best encrypted messaging tool available to the public want to be clear about one thing: SignalGate is not about Signal.\nSince The Atlantic’s editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed Monday that he was mistakenly included in a Signal group chat earlier this month created to plan US airstrikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, the reaction from the Trump cabinet’s critics and even the administration itself has in some cases seemed to cast blame on Signal for the security breach. Some commentators have pointed to reports last month of Signal-targeted phishing by Russian spies. National security adviser Michael Waltz, who reportedly invited Goldberg to the Signal group chat, has even suggested that Goldberg may have hacked into it.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, even President Donald Trump suggested Signal was somehow responsible for the group chat fiasco. “I don't know that Signal works,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “I think Signal could be defective, to be honest with you.”\nThe real lesson is much simpler, says Kenn White, a security and cryptography researcher who has conducted audits on widely used encryption tools in the past as the director of the Open Crypto Audit Project: Don’t invite untrusted contacts into your Signal group chat. And if you’re a government official working with highly sensitive or classified information, use the encrypted communication tools that run on restricted, often air-gapped devices intended for a top-secret setting rather than the unauthorized devices that can run publicly available apps like Signal.\n“Unequivocally, no blame in this falls on Signal,” says White. “Signal is a communication tool designed for confidential conversations. If someone's brought into a conversation who’s not meant to be part of it, that's not a technology problem. That's an operator issue.”\nCryptographer Matt Green, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, puts it more simply. “Signal is a tool. If you misuse a tool, bad things are going to happen,” says Green. “If you hit yourself in the face with a hammer, it’s not the hammer’s fault. It’s really on you to make sure you know who you’re talking to.”\nThe only sense in which SignalGate is a Signal-related scandal, White adds, is that the use of Signal suggests that the cabinet-level officials involved in the Houthi bombing plans, including secretary of defense Pete Hegseth and director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, were conducting the conversation on internet-connected devices—possibly even including personal ones—since Signal wouldn’t typically be allowed on the official, highly restricted machines intended for such conversations. “In past administrations, at least, that would be absolutely forbidden, especially for classified communications,” says White.\nIndeed, using Signal on internet-connected commercial devices doesn’t just leave communications open to anyone who can somehow exploit a hackable vulnerability in Signal, but anyone who can hack the iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac devices that might be running the Signal mobile or desktop apps.\nThis is why US agencies in general, and the Department of Defense in particular, conduct business on specially managed federal devices that are specially provisioned to control what software is installed and which features are available. Whether the cabinet members had conducted the discussion on Signal or another consumer platform, the core issue was communicating about incredibly high-stakes, secret military operations using inappropriate devices or software.\nOne of the most straightforward reasons that communication apps like Signal and WhatsApp are not suitable for classified government work is that they offer “disappearing message” features—mechanisms to automatically delete messages after a preset amount of time—that are incompatible with federal record retention laws. This issue was on full display in the principals’ chat about the impending strike on Yemen, which was originally set for one-week auto-delete before the Michael Waltz account changed the timer to four-week auto-delete, according to screenshots of the chat published by The Atlantic on Wednesday. Had The Atlantic’s Goldberg not been mistakenly included in the chat, its contents might not have been preserved in accordance with long-standing government requirements.\nIn congressional testimony on Wednesday, US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that Signal can come preinstalled on government devices. Multiple sources tell WIRED that this is not the norm, though, and noted specifically that downloading consumer apps like Signal to Defense Department devices is highly restricted and often banned. The fact that Hegseth, the defense secretary, participated in the chat indicates that he either obtained an extremely unusual waiver to install Signal on a department device, bypassed the standard process for seeking such a waiver, or was using a non-DOD device for the chat. According to political consultant and podcaster Fred Wellman, DOD “political appointees” demanded that Signal be installed on their government devices last month.\nCore to the Trump administration’s defense of the behavior is the claim that no classified material was discussed in the Signal chat. In particular, Gabbard and others have noted that Hegseth himself is the classification authority for the information. Multiple sources tell WIRED, though, that this authority does not make a consumer application the right forum for such a discussion.\n“The way this was being communicated, the conversation had no formal designation like 'for official use only' or something. But whether it should have been classified or not, whatever it was, it was obviously sensitive operational information that no soldier or officer would be expected to release to the public—but they had added a member of the media into the chat,” says Andy Jabbour, a US Army veteran and founder of the domestic security risk-management firm Gate 15.\nJabbour adds that military personnel undergo annual information awareness and security training to reinforce operating procedures for handling all levels of nonpublic information. Multiple sources emphasize to WIRED that while the information in the Yemen strike chat appears to meet the standard for classification, even nonclassified material can be extremely sensitive and is typically carefully protected.\n“Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it’s also just mind-boggling to me that all of these senior folks who were on this line and nobody bothered to even check, security hygiene 101, who are all the names? Who are they?” US senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said during Tuesday’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.\nAccording to The Atlantic, 12 Trump administration officials were in the Signal group chat, including vice president JD Vance, secretary of state Marco Rubio, and Trump adviser Susie Wiles. Jabbour adds that even with decisionmaking authorities present and participating in a communication, establishing an information designation or declassifying information happens through an established, proactive process. As he puts it, “If you spill milk on the floor, you can’t just say, ‘That’s actually not spilled milk, because I intended to spill it.’”\nAll of which is to say, SignalGate raises plenty of security, privacy, and legal issues. But the security of Signal itself is not one of them. Despite that, in the wake of The Atlantic’s story on Monday, some have sought tenuous connections between the Trump cabinet’s security breach and Signal vulnerabilities. On Tuesday, for example, a Pentagon adviser echoed a report from Google’s security researchers, who alerted Signal earlier this year to a phishing technique that Russian military intelligence used to target the app’s users in Ukraine. But Signal pushed out an update to make that tactic—which tricks users into adding a hacker as a secondary device on their account—far harder to pull off, and the same tactic also targeted some accounts on the messaging services WhatsApp and Telegram.\n“Phishing attacks against people using popular applications and websites are a fact of life on the internet,” Signal spokesperson Jun Harada tells WIRED. “Once we learned that Signal users were being targeted, and how they were being targeted, we introduced additional safeguards and in-app warnings to help protect people from falling victim to phishing attacks. This work was completed months ago.\"\nIn fact, says White, the cryptography researcher, if the Trump administration is going to put secret communications at risk by discussing war plans on unapproved commercial devices and freely available messaging apps, they could have done much worse than to choose Signal for those conversations, given its reputation and track record among security experts.\n“Signal is the consensus recommendation for highly at-risk communities—human rights activists, attorneys, and confidential sources for journalists,” says White. Just not, as this week has made clear, executive branch officials planning airstrikes.\nUpdated at 5:50 pm ET, March 25, 2025: Added remarks about Signal by President Trump.",

The bureau is nested within the US Treasury and handles most federal payments, to the tune of more than $5 trillion a year.\nWIRED first reported that Marko Elez, a former engineer at X, the social media company owned by Musk, had read/write access to two BFS systems: the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) and Secure Payment System (SPS). But documents now reveal that Elez also had “read” access to Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP), an accounting system where federal funds are stored in pre-authorized accounts. Court documents shared by the government reveal Elez had access as of February 1.\nFrom court filings, it appears this access was in service of the administration’s plans to target USAID.\nUSAID was one of the earliest targets of DOGE and the Trump administration. Less than two weeks after Trump’s inauguration, the majority of the agency’s staff were placed on administrative leave, and funding to many partner organizations was cut off. The documents appear to show how plans were in place for this sudden strangulation in payments to happen.\nIn a January 26 email between Matthew Garber, a top Treasury official, and the Treasury secretary’s chief of staff, Garber outlined the new administration’s plan to utilize BFS access to halt payments to USAID.\n“Fiscal will intercept USAID payments files prior to ingestion into our PAM/SPS systems (this is in place now and can begin immediately),” Garber wrote. “We developed a process to intercept the file, and additional flags to ensure we catch all USAID payment requests through our systems.” (This email chain was included as part of documents shared in the Alliance for Retired Americans lawsuit.)\n“Fiscal will manually pull an unredacted and unmodified copy to share with State officials,” Garber continued, outlining plans from his team. \"State officials will review and provide a determination to Fiscal on whether or not to release the file into our normal payment processes.”\nA top Treasury official’s calendar shows that a few days later, Elez arrived in Kansas City, one of the main BFS sites, and had a full docket of meet and greets and several deep dives with the teams responsible for each of the systems. The plan was for Elez to spend the next month at the facility to identify “opportunities to advance payment integrity and fraud reduction goals.” According to a planning sheet, which was also shared with the court, “only (1) individual (i.e. the designated technical team member)”—which was Elez—“requires access to Fiscal Service systems and data at this time.”\nRecords show that in the final days of January, a request was placed to grant Elez access to both systems. On January 31, David Lebryk, who had been acting Treasury secretary and at one point was the commissioner of BFS, abruptly announced he would retire after he had been placed on administrative leave for refusing to provide DOGE with access to these payment systems. For those who knew the Treasury intimately, this set off alarm bells. That same day, according to an attachment provided by the government, at 6:07 pm, a ticket was filed disregarding a previous order just a day before to give Elez just read-only access: “sorry read/write is needed.”\nAt the same time Lebryk stepped away, DOGE gained access to the entirety of USAID’s IT systems and network, according to reporting from ProPublica. The next day, as the dismantling of USAID was underway, according to court documents, Elez was granted access to the source codes of ASAP, SPS, and PAM. He was also granted read-only access to the production database for the SPS and PAM.\nPeople with knowledge of Treasury systems tell WIRED that it would be uncommon, if not “unheard of,” for a BFS employee to have access to all these systems simultaneously.\n“Within Fiscal, the mainframe guys don’t have write access to the databases and vice versa,” says a former BFS employee who requested anonymity in order to speak freely. Normally, they say, employees at BFS are given the minimum amount of access to systems required to do their jobs. “No BFS employee would normally have this kind of access.”\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82 and MattGiles45.42.\nAccording to an affidavit from another top Treasury official, though, that plan to isolate USAID payment files outlined by Garber was temporarily paused for the next several days—the State Department had decided it would instead intercept the files. However, on February 4 and February 5, USAID payments flowed to the PAM portal designed by Garber’s team.\nThat same affidavit outlined the next steps: BFS was instructed to focus on flagging, quarantining, and sending several payments to State officials that fell under President Donald Trump’s foreign aid executive order that stated there would be a 90-day pause on this aid as the State Department reviewed each program. This plan, according to an email chain included in one of the lawsuits, was vetted by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who was “comfortable proceeding.” These payments, which originated from the Department of Health and Human Services, included funding for “Refugee and Entrant Assistance,” “Gifts and Donations Office of Refugee Resettlement,” and “Refugee Resettlement Assistance.”\nBy then, Musk had doubled down on his contempt for USAID: In a February 2 post on X, Musk wrote, “USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.”\nDOGE operatives, including Luke Farritor, a young member, had gained “super administrator” access to USAID’s systems, according to ProPublica. Farritor, who had also been at the Department of Health and Human Services as well as the General Services Administration (GSA), was reportedly going through USAID’s payment system manually, shutting off agency funding, according to The Washington Post. Elez was in the midst of a similar operation in Kansas City: According to that Treasury official’s affidavit, the engineer began to manually identify and review the foreign aid payment files that had been sequestered in the folder Garber outlined in that late January email.\nMeanwhile, Treasury officials sought to give Elez even further access. A February 3 IT ticket, included in case documents from the Alliance for Retired Americans lawsuit, reveals that requests were made for Elez to access the Central Accounting Reporting System, “the electronic system of record for the government’s financial data.”\nThat same day, a motion filed by the plaintiffs in another lawsuit alleges Elez copied and downloaded a pair of USAID files from the PAM database to his laptop; around that same time, an affidavit from the Bureau of Fiscal Service’s chief security officer said Elez emailed a spreadsheet with personally identifiable information to two GSA officials via unencrypted channels. (Both of these actions are at the core of one of the lawsuits against Bessent and the Treasury Department; the plaintiffs in that suit were recently granted expedited discovery to access records related to Elez’s tenure at BFS.)\nA DOGE team had already established a presence at the GSA, which included Farritor, as well as former Tesla employee Thomas Shedd and other DOGE members Ethan Shaotran and Edward Coristine.\nAfter WIRED reported on February 4 that Elez had unprecedented access to the Treasury’s payments systems, Bessent asserted in a letter to Congress that Tom Krause, then a special government employee associated with DOGE at the Treasury, only had “read” access. Elez was not mentioned in that letter. In her memo granting a preliminary injunction in the American Federation of Teachers lawsuit, filed on March 24, Judge Deborah Boardman wrote, “according to a spreadsheet attached to a February 3, 2025 email from a Treasury executive point person for the engagement, as of February 1, Elez had access to Treasury systems including PAM, SPS, and ASAP, and it was recommended that his access to other Treasury systems be expanded.”\nOn February 5, while Elez had access to Treasury’s most sensitive systems, he received an email from the deputy assistant commissioner for enterprise IT operations noting that, though he had been issued a BFS laptop, he had yet to sign the bureau’s “rules of behavior.” (This email was included among documents shared by the government in one of the lawsuits.) Those rules include, following “laws, regulations, and policies governing the use and entrance to such facilities,” and protecting any “Fiscal Service data, equipment and IT systems from loss, theft, damage, and unauthorized use or disclosure.” Elez, it would appear, had already violated these rules by sharing the data with the GSA officials.\nThe next day, Elez resigned after the The Wall Street Journal sought comment for a report about racist posts on social media accounts that appeared to belong to him. Elez is now one of the many DOGE operatives working at the Social Security Administration.\nIn late February, USAID said it would cancel 90 percent of the agency’s contracts. The contract cancellations threw nonprofits around the world into chaos and slowed the response to infectious diseases. Earlier this month, a federal judge said the dismantling of USAID “likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways.”\nThe Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThis week, Trump signed an executive order stating that all federal payments should be consolidated within the Treasury. The order claims that doing so will help fight fraud, waste, and abuse.\nDon Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, believes the order means that, “instead of having to send some DOGE guy into an agency to control the payments, it all happens in one place. It moves power away from agencies and centralizes it in the White House.” In his order, Trump claimed that $1.5 trillion passes through other avenues, known as non-Treasury disbursing offices. These are nested within certain agencies that are able to disburse funds without going through the BFS system.\nMoynihan alleges that the strangulation of USAID’s funding could be a “harbinger” of potential changes at other agencies. The administration appears particularly focused, he says, on “the president having absolute power and control over where money goes regardless of laws on impoundment or statutes on agencies.”\n“It’s a consolidation of power in the name of efficiency,” he claims.",

    "content_text": "Extropic is not a normal startup. But then, these are hardly normal times.\nThe company is developing a radical new kind of computer chip that harnesses the thermodynamic fluctuations that naturally occur within electronic circuits—and which are normally a headache for engineers—using them to perform highly efficient calculations with probabilities.\nThis chip might well find some takers as AI giants search for ever more computer power to build AI models that perform artificial reasoning, and as we all worry about AI’s incredible energy demands.\nExtropic has now shared more details of its probabilistic hardware with WIRED, as well as results that show it is on track to build something that could indeed offer an alternative to conventional silicon in many datacenters. The company aims to deliver a chip that is three to four orders of magnitude more efficient than today’s hardware, a feat that would make a sizable dent in future emissions.\nI wrote about Extropic’s strange backstory for WIRED’s special issue on the Frontiers of Computing. My piece explores the remarkable technological, political, and cultural currents that led to the company’s founding. But it’s well worth taking a closer look at Extropic’s technology.\nA technical document provided to me by Extropic includes a signal from an oscilloscope (an instrument that measures electronic voltage over time) showing a probabilistic bit or p-bit in action. A conventional computer bit is fixed as either a one or a zero. A p-bit has a certain probability of being in either state and the oscilloscope image shows a p-bit flipping between 1 and 0. The crucial thing is that Extropic can control the probability that the bit will be in either state at any point in time. And by engineering interactions between several such p-bits it is possible to perform more complex probabilistic computations.\n“This signal on the oscilloscope may seem simple at first glance, but it demonstrates a key building block for our platform, representing the birth of the world’s first scalable, mass-manufacturable, and energy-efficient probabilistic computing platform,” says Guillaume Verdon, CEO of Extropic and the man behind the wildly popular, provocative, and sometimes controversial online persona Based Beff Jezos.\nOne of Extropic’s innovations is a way of controlling thermodynamic effects in conventional silicon to perform calculations without extreme cooling. Efforts to compute thermodynamically have traditionally relied on superconducting electronic circuits, but Verdon and his cofounder, Trevor McCourt, are using fluctuations of electric charge in regular silicon instead.\nExtropic says its hardware is perfect for running Monte Carlo simulations, a class of computation that involves sampling probabilities that is widely used in areas like finance, biology, and AI. These computations are important for building reasoning models like OpenAI o3 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking from Google.\n“The reality is that the most computationally-hungry workloads are Monte Carlo simulations,” Verdon says. “We are not just interested in AI, but also applications in simulations of stochastic systems in high-performance computing at large.”\nExtropic’s founders concede that the idea of taking on Nvidia and other chipmakers might seem, on the face of it, absolutely insane. Nvidia’s chips are still the best for training AI, and switching to a completely alien architecture would be costly and time consuming.\nBut we are at a unique moment when AI companies need so much computer power for AI that they are building datacenters next to nuclear power stations, when nation states are set to spend wild amounts on AI, and when the technology’s environmental impact is only getting worse. Perhaps, given all this, it is more nuts not to try to reinvent how computers work.\nDo you think Extropic has a chance to challenge Nvidia’s chip dominance? Is it time to rethink computing entirely?

    "content_text": "If there is one certainty of social media in 2025, it’s this: Rage clicks rule. Hyperbole, hate, cheap shock—it’s all par for the course—and often rewarded with virality.\nBut Sez Us, an app just launched by veteran Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, believes it’s possible to change that by punishing users who shitpost for the sake of provocation.\nThe timing may be just right. America is entering an age of oligarchy with a rising wave of right-wing extremism taking hold of global politics. Platforms like Truth Social and X now operate as effective propaganda machines, recasting culture-war issues over immigration, DEI, and trans rights as boogeymen in President Trump’s new vision of America, which is really just a very old version of America. As the next era of social media comes into view, emerging platforms also have an opportunity to rise to the moment. Can Sez Us, which is positioning itself as the antithesis to X, facilitate a better way forward?\n“If you bring back responsibility, ownership, and reputation, then suddenly all the incentives that we have in the real world are back,” says Yevgeny Simkin, Sez Us’ cofounder and chief product officer.\nEven as online discourse has devolved into rabid spectacle, platforms like Bluesky have shown there is an appetite for a more civil kind of conversation. Rather than boosting any post that’s getting rage clicks, Sez Us uses what its creators call a “reputation engine,” a feature that allows you to rate another user’s posts on the platform across five key areas: approval, influence, insightfulness, relevance, and politeness.\nOn the app, ratings determine a user’s reputation score and overall visibility. The higher the score, the more reach you have in the community. Users control who replies to them based on a person’s score, with low-scoring users penalized by having less influence. All posts are visible but you can block users from replying to you, for example, if they don’t have high-approval ratings. Ultimately, ratings are designed to deprioritize engagement based around viral moments.\n“It’s not about the moderators coming in and saying ‘you’re bad,’” Simkin says. “It’s about the community saying ‘we don’t like what you’re saying.’ Then I know that I have to temper how I say things. I have to be more polite. I have to be less bombastic.”\nIn the race to perfect social media, there has never been a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to moderation—for those who still bother with it. Scale can make this task even more difficult as a platform’s user base grows. For Simkin and his team, the idea was to build a platform that would “bring to the fore all the ways in which social media should be running rather than the way it has been,” he says. “The camel’s back was broken by the straw of Elon [Musk] buying Twitter,” and suddenly a whole new world seemed possible.\nThe fracturing of Twitter, since rebranded as X, kicked off an arms race among techies who had all sorts of ideas about the next phase of social media, and how to define it. It was during this period, in 2022, that the concept for Sez Us was born, grounded in the lofty goal of bringing back civil discourse.\nReturning constructive debate to online discourse is important to Simkin. “I have a particular view on freedom of expression and freedom of freedom because I’m familiar with what it means not to have either,” he says. In 2022, as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, Simkin, who was raised in Soviet Russia before immigrating to Canada, built Samizdat Online, an anti-censorship platform that allows citizens in totalitarian societies to read news by banned outlets without fear of being tracked and persecuted.\nSimilar to Bluesky, another new-ish app that has emerged as an alternative to Elon Musk’s X, Sez Us does not own any of your data. It was built using a decentralized social networking protocol, which allows users to move their assets and content across platforms. Bots are kept off the app through mobile verification. Low scores likewise prevent bots and individuals with bad intentions from gaining traction.\n“Numbers aren’t the holy grail of this thing,” says Akshay Gupta, the chief operations officer. “Just because you have a massive score doesn't mean you're winning on the platform. It just allows people to know what type of reputation you have.” Even if that is true, reputation scores do ultimately matter in the end. The lower the number, the less reach a user is allowed.\nWhen I mention to Simkin and Gupta that the idea behind its moderation-based scoring reminds me of an episode of Black Mirror, they push back. “We’re not defining what’s civil. It's the Overton window of the community. Whoever is there gets to participate and then those metrics will move,” Simkin says.\nMany startup founders have tried, and failed, to design their own version of a digital Elysium. The main obstacle working against emerging social platforms that have launched in the past three years is TikTok. They don’t have its cool, reach, or strange wonder. But that is also their advantage. What the next age of social connection calls for—one of the many things, at least—is not more super platforms but instead purpose-driven communities. It calls for digital rallying grounds of all sorts, ones like Reddit but also like BlackSky, a Bluesky community for Black users, which already mirrors a version of what Sez Us wants to accomplish.\n“No new endeavor is going to be dead on out the gate,” Gupta adds. “We’ve got an intention. We have a North Star. And we’re starting to see the behavioral elements of it work. Disagreements are great. We’re not stopping anyone from coming on the platform.” All backgrounds, religious affiliations, and political perspectives are welcome, they say.\nIt’s hard to know if any of this will work. Right now, Sez Us only has 10,000 active users. And Simkin has measured expectations for what they can accomplish. “I’m not looking to improve humanity,” he says. “That’s somebody else’s job.”\nBy incentivizing healthy discussion, he says, the plan is “to move technological discourse to a level where people can engage as themselves. The key is to help everybody recognize that we're actually not enemies.” Whether a critical mass of people wants that remains to be seen.",

America is entering an <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/money-issue/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">age of oligarchy</a> with a rising wave of right-wing extremism taking hold of global politics.

As the next era of social media comes into view, emerging platforms also have an opportunity to rise to the moment. Can Sez Us, which is positioning itself as the antithesis to X, facilitate a better way forward?</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">“If you bring back responsibility, ownership, and reputation, then suddenly all the incentives that we have in the real world are back,” says Yevgeny Simkin, Sez Us’ cofounder and chief product officer.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">Even as online discourse has devolved into <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/heres-proof-hate-speech-is-more-viral-on-elon-musks-twitter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rabid spectacle</a>, platforms like Bluesky have shown there is an appetite for a more civil kind of conversation. Rather than boosting any post that’s getting rage clicks, Sez Us uses what its creators call a “reputation engine,” a feature that allows you to rate another user’s posts on the platform across five key areas: approval, influence, insightfulness, relevance, and politeness.</p><p class=\"paywall\">On the app, ratings determine a user’s reputation score and overall visibility. The higher the score, the more reach you have in the community. Users control who replies to them based on a person’s score, with low-scoring users penalized by having less influence. All posts are visible but you can block users from replying to you, for example, if they don’t have high-approval ratings. Ultimately, ratings are designed to deprioritize engagement based around viral moments.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“It’s not about the moderators coming in and saying ‘you’re bad,’” Simkin says. “It’s about the community saying ‘we don’t like what you’re saying.’ Then I know that I have to temper how I say things. I have to be more polite. I have to be less bombastic.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">In the race to perfect social media, there has never been a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to moderation—for those who <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-ditches-fact-checkers-in-favor-of-x-style-community-notes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">still bother with it</a>. Scale can make this task even more difficult as a platform’s user base grows. For Simkin and his team, the idea was to build a platform that would “bring to the fore all the ways in which social media should be running rather than the way it has been,” he says. “The camel’s back was broken by the straw of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-owns-twitter-deal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Elon [Musk] buying Twitter</a>,” and suddenly a whole new world seemed possible.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The fracturing of Twitter, since <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-dead-x-elon-musk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rebranded as X</a>, kicked off an arms race among techies who had all sorts of ideas about the next phase of social media, and how to define it.

Learn more.\nIn the early 1920s, a trio of scientists sat down for a break at Rothamsted agricultural research station in Hertfordshire, UK. One of them, a statistician by the name of Ronald Fisher, poured a cup of tea, then offered it to his colleague Muriel Bristol, an algae specialist who would later have the plant C. muriella named after her. Bristol refused, as she liked to put the milk in before the tea. Fisher was skeptical. Surely it didn’t matter? Yes, she said, it did. A cup with milk poured first tasted better.\n“Let’s test her,” chipped in the third scientist, who also happened to be Bristol’s fiancé. That raised the question of how to assess her tasting abilities. They would need to make sure she was given both types of tea, so she could make a fair comparison. They settled on pouring several cups, some tea-then-milk and others milk-then-tea, then getting her to try them one at a time. But there were still a couple of problems. Bristol might try to anticipate the sequence they’d chosen, which meant cups needed to arrive in a genuinely random order. And even if the ordering was random, she might get a few correct by chance. So there would need to be enough cups to ensure this was sufficiently unlikely.\nFisher realized that if they gave her six cups—three with milk first and three with milk second—there were 20 different ways they could be randomly ordered. Therefore, if she simply guessed, one in 20 times she’d get all six correct. What about using eight cups instead? In this situation, Fisher calculated there were 70 possible combinations, meaning there was a one in 70—or 1.4 percent—probability she’d get the sequence right by sheer luck. This was the experiment they decided to run with Bristol. They poured eight cups, four of each type, and got her to test them in a random order. She named the four she preferred, and the four she disliked, then they compared her conclusions with the true pattern. She’d got all eight correct.\nThe reason for Bristol’s success was ultimately down to chemistry. In 2008, the Royal Society of Chemistry reported that tea-then-milk will give the milk a more burnt flavour. “If milk is poured into hot tea, individual drops separate from the bulk of the milk and come into contact with the high temperatures of the tea for enough time for significant denaturation to occur,” they noted. “This is much less likely to happen if hot water is added to the milk.”\nFisher later described the tea-tasting experiment in a 1935 book titled simply The Design of Experiments. Among other things, the book summarized the crucial techniques they’d pioneered in that Rothamsted tea room. One was the importance of randomization; it wouldn’t have been a rigorous test of Bristol’s ability if the ordering of the cups was somehow predictable. Another was how to arrive at a scientific conclusion. Fisher’s basic statistical recipe was simple: start with an initial theory—he called it the “null hypothesis”—then test it against data. In the Rothamsted tea room, Fisher’s null hypothesis had been that Bristol couldn’t tell the difference between tea-then-milk and milk-then-tea. Her success in the resulting experiment showed Fisher had good reason to discard his null hypothesis.\nBut what if she’d only got seven out of eight correct? Or six, or five? Would that mean the null hypothesis was correct and she couldn’t tell the difference at all? According to Fisher, the answer was no. “It should be noted that the null hypothesis is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation,” he later wrote. “Every experiment may be said to exist only in order to give the facts a chance of disproving the null hypothesis.” If Bristol had got one or two wrong, it didn’t necessarily mean she had zero ability to distinguish milk order. It just meant the experiment hadn’t provided strong enough evidence to reject Fisher’s initial view that it made no difference.\nIf Fisher wanted experiments to challenge null hypotheses, he needed to decide where to set the line. Statistical findings have traditionally been deemed “significant” if the probability of obtaining a result that extreme by chance (i.e. the p-value) is less than 5 percent. But why did a p-value of 5 percent become such a popular threshold?\nIt came down to a combination of copyright and convenience. In a 1908 paper, the statistician William Sealy Gosset had investigated how randomness in data could influence data analysis, with the paper containing pages of statistical tables on the influence of randomness. Fisher was keen to draw upon this research, but was cautious about lifting the copyrighted tables directly. So instead he reframed them, and found that a suitable p-value for determining statistical significance suggested by the work—of around 4.6 percent—lined up neatly with some calculations he had already been doing. It was easy to round it up to 5 percent.\nWhen Muriel Bristol picked those cups, there was a 1.4 percent chance she would get that many correct. In Fisher’s eyes, this provided “significant” evidence that his null hypothesis was wrong. As he would later put it, a p-value below 5 percent meant “either an exceptionally rare chance has occurred or the theory is not true.”\nThe statistical comparison used in that tea-room experiment would become known as “Fisher’s exact test,” but not everyone was convinced Fisher had got his approach exactly right. In his experiments, Fisher was interested in testing whether the null hypothesis was wrong, not in deciding which hypothesis was correct. Suppose Muriel Bristol had got a couple of cups wrong. On balance, should we conclude that she couldn’t tell the difference? Or that she could? As we’ve seen, Fisher’s test dodges making a choice in this situation; it doesn’t come to any conclusion.\nStatisticians Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson (the son of Karl Pearson, who first coined the p-value) didn’t think this was good enough. If they started with two hypotheses—such as whether someone can or can’t tell the difference between cups of tea—they didn’t want a method that refuses to choose. According to Neyman and Pearson, researchers need a way to decide which hypothesis to accept and which to reject.\nThis decision-based attitude to statistics is analogous to the approach taken in legal cases. Much like legal decisions, Neyman and Pearson’s approach requires us to decide on the burden of proof: faced with a particular piece of evidence, how skeptical should we be? If we’re easily persuaded, we’ll end up accepting many hypotheses, whether or not they’re true. In contrast, if we set the bar for evidence very high, we’ll throw out most hypotheses that are false, but also disregard many that are true.\nTo deal with this trade-off, Neyman and Pearson introduced two concepts that would go on to plague statistics students: type I and type II errors. The first error occurs when we incorrectly accept the false hypothesis; the second happens when we incorrectly reject the true hypothesis.\nConsider the Blackstone ratio, which suggests that it’s better to have 10 guilty people incorrectly released than have one innocent person imprisoned. In essence, the ratio is saying that, when it comes to criminal justice, the chance of a type I error should be 10 times smaller than the chance of a type II error. In medical studies, a ratio 4 is commonly used instead: the popular threshold for a type I error is a probability of 5 percent (thanks to Fisher) but 20 percent for a type II error. We don’t want to miss a treatment that works, but we really don’t want to conclude that a treatment works when it doesn’t.\nFisher did not take Neyman and Pearson’s criticisms well. In response, he called their methods “childish” and “absurdly academic.” In particular, Fisher disagreed with the idea of deciding between two hypotheses, rather than calculating the “significance” of available evidence, as he’d proposed. Whereas a decision is final, his significance tests gave only a provisional opinion, which could be later revised. Even so, Fisher’s appeal for an open scientific mind was somewhat undermined by his insistence that researchers should use a 5 percent cutoff for a “significant” p-value, and his claim that he would “ignore entirely all results which fail to reach this level.”\nAcrimony would give way to decades of ambiguity, as textbooks gradually muddled together Fisher’s null hypothesis testing with Neyman and Pearson’s decision-based approach. A nuanced debate over how to interpret evidence, with discussion of statistical reasoning and design of experiments, instead became a set of fixed rules for students to follow.\nMainstream scientific research would come to rely on simplistic p-value thresholds and true-or-false decisions about hypotheses. In this role-learned world, experimental effects were either present or they were not. Medicines either worked or they didn’t. It wouldn’t be until the 1980s that major medical journals finally started breaking free of these habits.\nIronically, much of the shift can be traced back to an idea that Neyman coined in the early 1930s. With economies struggling in the Great Depression, he’d noticed there was growing demand for statistical insights into the lives of populations. Unfortunately, there were limited resources available for governments to study these problems. Politicians wanted results in months—or even weeks—and there wasn’t enough time or money for a comprehensive study. As a result, statisticians had to rely on sampling a small subset of the population. This was an opportunity to develop some new statistical ideas. Suppose we want to estimate a particular value, like the proportion of the population who have children. If we sampled 100 adults at random and none of them are parents, what does this suggest about the country as a whole? We can’t say definitively that nobody has a child, because if we sampled a different group of 100 adults, we might find some parents. We therefore need a way of measuring how confident we should be about our estimate. This is where Neyman’s innovation came in. He showed that we can calculate a “confidence interval” for a sample which tells us how often we should expect the true population value to lie in a certain range.\nConfidence intervals can be a slippery concept, given they require us to interpret tangible real-life data by imagining many other hypothetical samples being collected. Like those type I and type II errors, Neyman’s confidence intervals address an important question, just in a way that often perplexes students and researchers. Despite these conceptual hurdles, there is value in having a measurement that can capture the uncertainty in a study. It’s often tempting—particularly in media and politics—to focus on a single average value. A single value might feel more confident and precise, but ultimately it is an illusory conclusion. In some of our public-facing epidemiological analysis, my colleagues and I have therefore chosen to report only the confidence intervals, to avoid misplaced attention falling on specific values.\nSince the 1980s, medical journals have put more focus on confidence intervals rather than standalone true-or-false claims. However, habits can be hard to break. The relationship between confidence intervals and p-values hasn’t helped. Suppose our null hypothesis is that a treatment has zero effect. If our estimated 95 percent confidence interval for the effect doesn’t contain zero, then the p-value will be less than 5 percent, and based on Fisher’s approach, we will reject the null hypothesis. As a result, medical papers are often less interested in the uncertainty interval itself, and instead more interested in the values it does—or doesn’t—contain. Medicine might be trying to move beyond Fisher, but the influence of his arbitrary 5 percent cutoff remains.\nExcerpt adapted from Proof: The Uncertain Science of Certainty, by Adam Kucharski.

    "content_text": "I’m crouching in a seedy alleyway off Trafalgar Square, London, with my MacBook teetering on one knee. The heady reek of piss fills my nostrils. I’m hurriedly punching emoji into a dialog box in my web browser, which is prompting me for the answer to a puzzle. It’s day nine of Crypto: The Game.\nCTG is an elimination game that takes place over 10 days, almost exclusively online. It’s a sort of mutant conglomeration of ideas from Survivor, Squid Game, The Hunger Games, and The Traitors, except everything is crypto-inflected in some way. Each of the 716 players that signed up for the third season, myself included, purchased an entry NFT for $200 in cryptocurrency. The last player standing would win the $140,000 pot.\nI had raced to Trafalgar Square on that Tuesday afternoon—barreling through tourists like a shoplifter fleeing the law—following clues that promised a route back into the game. I had been voted out by my fellow players the previous night, but if I could solve the puzzle quickly, I might be “resurrected” and have another shot at victory.\nA group of allied players and I had decoded an alphanumeric cipher to arrive at a second peculiar code. When I entered it into ChatGPT, it led to a text file that read, “Congratulations on decoding the clue! The treasure is hidden at coordinates 51.5074° N, 0.1278° W.” I was only five minutes away.\nBut when I arrived, panting, it was clear I had it wrong. ChatGPT had apparently hallucinated the coordinates. By the time the real answer—the string of emoji—was circulating in the chat, other players had beaten me to it. My game had come to an end.\nThe first two editions of Crypto: The Game, which took place in February and April 2024, were an instant hit among crypto fans starved of ways to have fun with crypto beyond trading it.\nDevelopers have long struggled to blend crypto functionality into games and services that people want to use because they’re enticing, not just for the opportunity to turn a quick profit. But CTG players waxed lyrical about the game, which became the talk of Crypto Twitter during the first two seasons.\n“Financial incentives are the greatest [user] acquisition tool in the world, but very bad for retention,” says David Phelps, founder of crypto startup JokeRace, who played in the second season of CTG. “Tapping into social incentives is almost radical in crypto.”\nCTG is partly a game of skill; each day, tribes of players compete in a challenge—typically some sort of crypto puzzle, scavenger hunt, or arcade game—with the goal of earning temporary immunity from elimination. But it’s predominantly a social game; one of politicking, alliance-building, maneuvering, and backstabbing. Each night, the tribes without immunity are tasked with voting out a varying number of their own players until only a handful remain. On the final day, a single winner is crowned by the eliminated players.\n“You can’t just backstab your way to the top,” Dylan Abruscato, the creator of CTG, told WIRED in an interview last spring. “You need to play a ruthless but respected game.”\nNearly a decade ago, Abruscato was an executive at HQ Trivia, a live quizzing game that became a viral hit before the operation ran out of cash. CTG is a spiritual successor of sorts, pitched at a narrower audience: chronically online crypto fanatics.\nAfter the debut season, each subsequent edition has had its own twist. In season two, all players were anonymous, and entry NFTs could be traded on the secondary market. This time, players had to register with an X account but were given a small chance to earn their way back into the game by way of resurrection. “Every season is its own unique social experiment,” says Abruscato. “I always want to keep players on their toes.”\nWhen I spoke to Abruscato again ahead of the third season, he was careful not to say anything that might give me an undue advantage. But we did discuss the possibility that high-profile players might be targeted for elimination. I’m far from a household name, but given the animus toward journalists in some quarters of cryptoland, I decided to go undercover.\nIn my two-and-a-half years covering crypto, I have reported on all manner of frauds, bankruptcies, scams, and other morally dubious shenanigans. The common thread has been the extraction of wealth, which generally flows into the pockets of an already-wealthy or nefarious few at the expense of those who can least afford to lose.\nBut CTG struck me as different. It was an opportunity to embed among technologists convinced of the latent potential of crypto technologies, in an experiment that is far less about profit—despite players competing to win a pot of money—than about expressing crypto’s hacker culture and colorful lore.\nI asked a random name generator to assign me an alter ego: Leo Westley. It had a ring to it. Then I created new Google and X accounts and picked up a burner SIM, knowing that players would be communicating over Telegram and working in shared spreadsheets, which they use to coordinate voting.\nAs Leo’s profile image, I chose a picture of a floppy-eared spaniel that I sometimes look after. What could be more disarming?\nBefore the game began, I listened back to my conversations with CTG players from previous seasons, hoping to glean some essential wisdom that might help me to survive at least a couple of nights.\nTheir advice was generally to fly low; not to do anything that would mark me out as either particularly competent or overly hapless. Leaders are quickly eliminated, as are deadweights.\n“To some degree, almost being invisible was a super strength,” said Phelps. “You don’t want to be absent, because you’ll get killed for not contributing. And you don’t really want to stick your head up. Then people think you might be a risk to them.”\nKaty Jeremko, founder of developer cooperative Indie and another former player, had given me an equally precious piece of advice: “Your vote is your most valuable currency.”\nWith those warnings ringing in my ears, I entered the game on March 10 and was placed into the Gold Tribe along with around 70 other players.\nImmediately, people fell into archetypal character roles: there were leaders, organizers, data nerds, hype artists, and wallflowers. One person set up a Telegram group and began to ferret away in a spreadsheet. Another “vibe-coded” a program that scraped blockchain data to track who remained in the game. Others shitposted in the chat. Paralyzed by fear of saying the wrong thing, I said very little more than hello.\nPrivately, I created my own spreadsheet to make notes on my tribe members, recording their every minor infraction. “Kinda annoying,” I scribbled next to one guy’s handle. “Muppet, get rid,” I wrote next to another. I had met them barely hours earlier.\nInitially, I floated through the nightly eliminations by being performatively present. I contributed to the challenges, updated the spreadsheets when required, and posted in the chat at intervals. The tribe adopted “Gold morning” as a greeting, so I started saying it too.\nThings came to a head on day three. To earn immunity, we had been tasked with achieving the highest possible pinball score. After somebody found a way to cheese the game by rhythmically tapping the up key, it became a challenge of endurance rather than skill. I spent hours improving my score—far longer than my manager would care to know. One player said they felt like they were in an episode of Severance: “I heard if we hit 10M points we get a waffle party,” they quipped.\nAfterward, my tribe having been comfortably outscored, the talk turned to the impending vote. The simplest option was to eliminate the lowest scorers. But one player, Luke Cannon, proposed the tribe abstain from voting entirely. It was a high-risk, high-reward strategy: In theory, everyone could be spared, but a single vote in the final minutes of the voting period, which lasted an hour, would be enough to eliminate an undeserving player.\nThe vote began at 8 pm ET, midnight for me. The abstinence strategy lasted all of four minutes before someone received a vote. As panic spread, more votes piled in. Players began to point fingers at one another: It was you, wasn’t it?\n“I am declaring martial law in Gold,” wrote Cannon, who had himself received a stray vote. “If you do not dm to contribute your vote you are at risk,” he added, appending a passive-aggressive smiley.\nMy heart began to throb a few beats faster. I was reluctant to side with the renegade, but if I was going to be eliminated, I didn’t want to go down twiddling my thumbs. I messaged Cannon privately and voted at his instruction.\nThough Cannon’s intervention saved a few worthy players, replacing them on the elimination board with nonparticipants and low pinball scorers, he was unable to save himself. The display of pacifism and tribe unity had descended into a bloodbath. But I had survived.\nThe following day, the gamemasters had prepared a surprise: Everyone would be changing tribes. I was swapped into Silver, bidding farewell to almost all of my old team members. Strangely, though really they were only strangers, I missed them.\nI was greeted by another set of self-elected leaders who were busy deploying a labyrinth of spreadsheets and Telegram chats, which this time could only be accessed with a Silver Tribe NFT. The idea was to prevent any infiltrators from sowing disorder—sabotage is not uncommon in CTG—but the more convoluted system bewildered some players.\nIt seemed a fitting allegory for the very crypto tendency to overcomplicate, where a manual process would do. “The most crypto experience ever,” remarked one player. “It’s 2025 we gotta do better 😂.”\nMeanwhile, I splintered into a separate chat made up of seven former Gold members that now belonged to Silver, who would become the closest thing I had in the game to a cabal.\nThe days began to blend together as I settled into my strange new routine: I woke up late, participated in the challenge, performed any necessary spreadsheet admin, kept abreast of conversation, and shuffled back to my desk for the vote at midnight. My unlucky partner, much-neglected for the duration of the game, was rudely awoken each night as I clambered over her to reach my side of the bed. As I tried to fall asleep, my mind replayed the conversations of the day, as if projected onto the inside of my eyelids.\nPlayers who failed to spend every waking moment with the tribe were marked out for potential elimination, professional duties and family life be damned. Though my partner gladly had a go at the arcade game challenges, she was otherwise bemused by my new preoccupation with my tribe. One day, I tried to solicit her advice on a point of in-game strategy. “I don’t know how crypto nerds think!” she responded with a laugh, shooing me back to my desk.\nUnlike in my previous tribe, the Silver leaders attempted to exercise total control over each elimination, assigning specific votes to specific players and even demanding proof of compliance. To help determine who should be voted out, one of them coded up a Telegram bot that required players to “check in” and recorded how frequently they contributed to the chat. Along with each player’s scores in the challenges, this data was fed into the spreadsheet.\nIn our splinter group, the former Gold members and I bristled at the idea of voting on rails but caved to the demands. “Tonight, servitude feels like the move? Lol,” wrote Nick Prince, one of my fellow conspirators. He was right.\nOn day eight, the game changed again. There would be no challenge, players were told, but all tribes would merge into one. “This is now an individual game,” the CTG website declared.\nWith 315 players still in play and only two days left until the finale, there was an undercurrent of tension. On Telegram, players started to talk about the “Red Wedding,” a famously bloody scene in Game of Thrones.\nBefore the vote, an anonymous person defaced the spreadsheet shared among all remaining players. “Dear Data Grunts,” the note read. “The data you’re inputting is just busy work. Hope you made friends this season. They’re all that’s going to save you now.”\nThe strategy among former Silver members was to arrange truces with a handful of other groups, thereby deflecting votes elsewhere. The trouble was knowing whether anyone could be trusted to keep their word. After allowing myself on previous nights to be cowed into voting as somebody else instructed, I resolved to vote as I pleased, come what may.\nThat night, 100 players were up for elimination, but potentially more if a large number of people received the same amount of votes. The statistical probability meant that a single vote would likely be fatal.\nFor the first few minutes, I watched the votes peel in. Then my gut flipped; my icon had flashed up onscreen, framed in red. I understood that my game had probably come to an end—and I would probably never find out who was responsible.\nI spent my own bullet on a player who, at least in my estimation, had behaved condescendingly in the chat. They and 157 other players went out with me.\nOn the final day, 68 players remained. Instead of voting against one another, they now had to pitch for the votes of everyone who had previously been eliminated. The individual with the greatest amount of support would win the $140,000 prize.\nA few of the finalists appeared on the CTG companion podcast Boys Club that aired nightly during the CTG season, to plead their case. Many said they would split the pot, either with people who voted for them, their tribe members, charitable organizations, or along some other lines. Others said they would spend the winnings on their children or use it to pay down medical debt. “I beg for your votes. This is life-changing money for my family,” said one player.\nAt the end of the first season of CTG, an anonymous player from Japan was crowned victor after wooing their peers with abstract poetry. The prize fund in the second season was claimed by a player who promised to commit the winnings to the legal defense of two developers behind crypto service Tornado Cash, who had been charged with money laundering.\nThis time, it came down to a single vote. Two front-runners leapfrogged one another on the leaderboard throughout the day. The prize was ultimately claimed by Ted, a player from California who had come in second place the previous season, who pitched voters on her redemption arc: Ted had been eliminated on the eighth night, like myself, but was given an NFT to participate in the final by a close ally, who believed that she had a better chance to win.\n“I still can’t believe it’s real. I feel manic,” said Ted, appearing on Boys Club after the vote. “I’m still speechless.”\nAfter I left the game, the immediate feeling was a sinking disappointment; though I never imagined I might win, I had invested a piece of myself in the competition. But that sensation was quickly swallowed by relief.\nAt the end of nine consecutive days spent consorting with strangers on the internet, I was emotionally and physically exhausted. The game demands constant outward performance and careful introspection from players, and even a brief lapse could result in their eviction. My exit felt like emerging from a fugue.\nI was reminded of something another player had said after they were eliminated from the game. “Off to touch some grass,” they told the tribe, signing off on Telegram. I decided I would do the same.",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\"><span class=\"lead-in-text-callout\">Before the game</span> began, I listened back to my conversations with CTG players from previous seasons, hoping to glean some essential wisdom that might help me to survive at least a couple of nights.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Their advice was generally to fly low; not to do anything that would mark me out as either particularly competent or overly hapless. Leaders are quickly eliminated, as are deadweights.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“To some degree, almost being invisible was a super strength,” said Phelps. “You don’t want to be absent, because you’ll get killed for not contributing. And you don’t really want to stick your head up. Then people think you might be a risk to them.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Katy Jeremko, founder of developer cooperative Indie and another former player, had given me an equally precious piece of advice: “Your vote is your most valuable currency.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">With those warnings ringing in my ears, I entered the game on March 10 and was placed into the Gold Tribe along with around 70 other players.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Immediately, people fell into archetypal character roles: there were leaders, organizers, data nerds, hype artists, and wallflowers. One person set up a Telegram group and began to ferret away in a spreadsheet. Another “vibe-coded” a program that scraped blockchain data to track who remained in the game. Others shitposted in the chat. Paralyzed by fear of saying the wrong thing, I said very little more than hello.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Privately, I created my own spreadsheet to make notes on my tribe members, recording their every minor infraction. “Kinda annoying,” I scribbled next to one guy’s handle. “Muppet, get rid,” I wrote next to another. I had met them barely hours earlier.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Initially, I floated through the nightly eliminations by being performatively present. I contributed to the challenges, updated the spreadsheets when required, and posted in the chat at intervals. The tribe adopted “Gold morning” as a greeting, so I started saying it too.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Things came to a head on day three. To earn immunity, we had been tasked with achieving the highest possible pinball score. After somebody found a way to cheese the game by rhythmically tapping the up key, it became a challenge of endurance rather than skill. I spent hours improving my score—far longer than my manager would care to know. One player said they felt like they were in an episode of <em>Severance</em>: “I heard if we hit 10M points we get a waffle party,” they quipped.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Afterward, my tribe having been comfortably outscored, the talk turned to the impending vote. The simplest option was to eliminate the lowest scorers. But one player, Luke Cannon, proposed the tribe abstain from voting entirely. It was a high-risk, high-reward strategy: In theory, everyone could be spared, but a single vote in the final minutes of the voting period, which lasted an hour, would be enough to eliminate an undeserving player.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The vote began at 8 pm ET, midnight for me. The abstinence strategy lasted all of four minutes before someone received a vote. As panic spread, more votes piled in. Players began to point fingers at one another: It was you, wasn’t it?</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Once I started thinking about the apocalypse, it was hard to stop. An unsettling encounter with the doomsday clock that hangs over New York City’s Union Square got me frantically searching WikiHow for survival tips. I soon found my way to the doomsday writings of a Canadian programmer named Virgil Dupras. He believes the collapse of civilization is imminent and that it will come in two waves.\nFirst, global supply chains will crumble. Modern technology relies on a delicate web of factories and international shipping routes that are exquisitely vulnerable to rapid climate change. The iPhone uses memory chips from South Korea, semiconductors from Taiwan, and assembly lines in Brazil and China. The severing of these links will, Dupras says, catalyze total societal breakdown.\nThe second part will happen when the last computer crashes. The complexity of modern hardware means it’s nearly impossible to repair or repurpose, and without the means to make new devices, Dupras believes there will be a slow blackout—less bang, more whimper. Routers die. Servers take their last breath. Phones crap out. Nothing works.\nExcept Collapse OS. Lightweight and designed to run on scavenged hardware, it’s Dupras’ operating system for the end of the world.\nDupras lives in the countryside of Quebec, Canada, with his wife and two kids, in a 500-person town where people chop their own wood, grow their own food, and sometimes build their own houses. It felt odd sending him a Google Calendar invite—I knew from his trove of essays that he hates big tech. When we spoke, he sounded oddly monotonous. Was it a bad connection? Muffled audio? No. Unlike many of his sustainably minded neighbors, Dupras thinks the battle against climate change is futile. We’ve already lost. “Once you’ve peeped into the abyss, you can’t really unsee it,” he says. Dupras has simply accepted his fate, to the point where it’s become an article of faith. The same way there are Catholics, there are Collapseniks, he says.\nBut he’s not hopeless. A hopeless man wouldn’t prep so monomaniacally for the anti-singularity. Dupras started building Collapse OS in 2019 in an attempt to preserve mankind’s ability to program 8-bit microcontrollers. These tiny computers control things like radios and solar panels, and they can be used in everything from weather monitoring to digital storage. Dupras figured that being able to reprogram them with minimal remaining resources would be essential post-collapse. But first he had to teach himself a suitably apocalypse-proofed programming language for the job.\nIn the late 1950s, the computer scientist Chuck H. Moore was working at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, predicting the future position of celestial bodies and satellites based on observational data. Machine memory was scarce—these were still the days of punch cards—and Moore needed a way to optimize processing efficiency by minimizing memory use. He developed a program that executed simple commands directly, one at a time, without needing to be recompiled. Over the next decade, it grew into a programming language that he called Forth.\nForth communicates directly with the hardware. It controls a computer’s memory via commands called “Words” that you define on the fly. Because the foundational set of commands sitting under those Words is defined in native machine code, only a small part needs to be translated—meaning a smaller assembler and less RAM. As a result, Forth offers a remarkable amount of what Dupras calls “power density,” making it the perfect foundation for Collapse OS. That matters because the lights (probably) won’t go off forever—instead, our easy world of electricity on tap will be replaced by precious and hard-won local generators. Efficient use of processing power will be pivotal. In a post on Collapse.org, his sprawling manifesto/blog/brain dump/manual, Dupras describes how his discovery of Forth conjured “what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity.”\nIt took Dupras two years to finish Collapse OS. Booting a copy of it from a USB stick gives tech-savvy users the ability to program microcontrollers, which, in turn, could allow them to automate greenhouses, control phone lines, and even regulate power. But Dupras knew that wouldn’t be enough to rebuild society after the collapse. So in 2022, he began work on Dusk OS—a version of Collapse OS that runs on modern devices. Dupras used Forth to build his own compiler that made Dusk OS compatible with code written in C (the foundation of most modern software). This way, without having to rewrite logic that already exists from scratch, Dusk OS is able to retrieve and edit text and access file formats commonly used to back up devices. It can be emulated to work on smartwatches and old tablets and is designed to be hacked and bootstrapped to its user’s liking.\nAt first I couldn’t see why any of this would even matter: Surely computer access won’t be a priority when we’re fighting each other for food? At no point during The Last of Us does Pedro Pascal pause his flight from the zombies to bang out an email. But Dupras makes a good point: What happens after we’ve reacquainted ourselves with hunting and gathering?\nIf we want to rebuild society, we’ll need to know how. And in the event of a civilizational collapse, a lot of our collective expertise—like my precious WikiHows—will be locked away on hard drives or lost in the cloud. Dupras hopes that Dusk OS will give post-collapse humans access to archives of lost knowledge, like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault for human endeavor. The catch? It’s best to have Dusk OS downloaded on an old phone, memory stick, or laptop before the collapse. Otherwise, without the internet, you’ll only be able to get it by copying it from someone who already has it installed. Which brings us to the other thing—the reason Dupras equates proficiency in Forth to power. Very few people will have both a copy of Dusk OS and the knowledge to operate it. This select group will hold the keys to rebuilding society and will become, in effect, post-collapse philosopher-kings. It was time for me to go Forth and conquer.\nCoding in Forth reminded me of the lawless dystopia in Mad Max. You make your own rules, subject to the limits of the context. You can redefine the IF statement if you so please. You can rewrite machine code instructions for a Word. You can even change Words during run time. Because Words become keywords themselves in Forth, you can create a language that’s optimized for a single purpose, packing commands that would otherwise be dozens of lines into just one. “In Forth, you’re creating your own language,” Leo Brodie, author of the first Forth textbook, Starting Forth, told me.\nThe low-level nature of Forth, while key to its processing power, made programming feel foreign. It uses postfix, a form of mathematical notation that renders 2 + 1 as 2 1+ and which I found neither intuitive nor even really legible. And while most languages allow memory to be broken up and moved around, Forth is stack-based—meaning data is stored chronologically and managed on a last-in/first-out basis. I kept running into bugs, forcing myself to abandon programming conventions I had considered universal. I found myself struggling to speak the language of the machine.\nWhen I emailed Dupras to ask for help, he compared using Forth to driving a stick. It’s more granular than C. Where the latter defines calling conventions, variable storage, and return stack management, Forth leaves it all up to the programmer. It directly interacts with memory the same way C does but far outperforms C in precision and efficiency. “People mistake Forth as just a language,” Dupras says. “It’s a way to interact with the computer.”\nThe reason Forth isn’t more popular is the same reason most of us drive automatics. The personal computing boom of the 1990s sparked an obsession with making tech fit your palm and making code easier to write. Languages were abstracted to protect programmers from themselves, and somewhere along the way, we got lost. Things became bloated for the sake of convenience and, in Dupras’ words, started “oozing inscrutable pus at every corner.”\n“The way we understand efficiency is so skewed,” Dupras says. Forth is a scythe to Python’s lawnmower. “If you calculate the number of joules per blade of grass, you’ll find that the person scything is more efficient,” he says. “When you think of speed, you’d see the lawnmower as more efficient.” Forth forces you to be precise and memory-efficient—to marshal your resources carefully, as you would after the collapse. Dupras cuts his own lawn with a scythe, obviously. “At a certain point, you can go as fast as a lawnmower,” he says.\nI began to find my way. Rather than sending bytes into the ether and trusting the system to figure out where they go, as I would in Python, I got used to being responsible for allocating and freeing memory. All I could think about was what was being stored, where it was being stored, and how much space it required. Each line of code suddenly bore weight. I was Immortan Joe, my laptop was my Citadel, and memory was my water.\nSoon I found myself refining and revisiting my code like I would a run-on sentence. Instead of expecting the machine to anticipate my needs, I tried to think like the machine, to meet it more than halfway. And because I had to think twice, all the needlessly complicated acronyms that remind us to be concise in other coding languages—YAGNI (you aren’t gonna need it), KISS (keep it simple, stupid), DRY (don’t repeat yourself)—were rendered obsolete.\nAfter spending days fiddling with Forth, returning to Python felt luxurious. I never had to consider memory scarce, and I never had to thoroughly explain myself. It felt like catching up with an old friend. At that moment, the resources that go into making programming “user-friendly” became painfully apparent.\nBefore I met Dupras, I thought of efficiency in terms of speed. But the true costs of that speed are carefully hidden in rural data centers and distant copper mines. I rarely considered the energy required to power each additional gigabyte of RAM, or the fact that cloud computing now has a bigger carbon footprint than the airline industry.\nDespite the compounding environmental costs, memory is as cheap and plentiful as it’s ever been. Today, languages that sit closer to the machine are only used out of necessity: banks trying to minimize latency for financial trades, spacecraft working with limited onboard resources, outdated systems that would require too much work to update.\nBut during a civilizational collapse, the quiet luxuries of array handling and automated memory management will largely disappear. As convenience whisks us further away from the machine, we risk forgetting how computers actually work and losing the ability to rebuild our tech in the event of a collapse. “No one remembers how to write a text editor,” says Devine, an independent programmer who corresponds with Dupras. “When you start forgetting how to do something as crucial as that, when things start to fall apart, they fall apart hard.”\nDevine views efficiency in programming not as a lawnmower or a scythe but as something more like a wildflower meadow—“the least amount of transformation of state possible.” In their view, AI is the pinnacle of “human-centric” programming, where the computer figures out what you’re trying to do and does it for you. Something clicked for me at that moment. As programmers grow more reliant on high-level languages, the average proficiency of low-level languages plummets, which increases the demand for the computing resources that support that abstraction in the first place. AI won’t just take our jobs, it’ll make us forget how to do them—if we don’t run out of the energy to power it first.\nBut maybe there is another way. Since 2016 Devine and their partner Rek have been living full-time on a small boat in the northern Pacific, and they use lower-level languages like Forth to maximize what they can do with the 190 watts of daily power they get from two solar panels. I found them on a mailing list of roughly a hundred Collapseniks. Their lifestyle was like a sneak preview of the resource-constrained life Dupras expects us all to be living soon. When I reached out for a chat in August, they told me they might have cell service in October.\nWhen we finally connected (audio only), Devine struck me as a younger, more optimistic version of Dupras. While fully sympathetic to Dupras’ vision of collapse, Devine believes in the power of low-level programming not for its ability to rebuild society but for its potential to prevent collapse. Devine has observed a growing trend called “permacomputing” that fosters a more mindful relationship with technology, one that considers resource constraints.\nAs I returned from the wilderness—back to the world of luxuries like hash tables and built-in libraries that I’d previously taken for granted—I brought back with me a new awareness of the intricacies of the machine, and maybe even a little hope. Forth is how Dupras prepares for the worst, but it’s also helping people like Devine and Rek code—and live—more sustainably. If we can all do that, perhaps the end of the world isn’t as inevitable as it seems.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

    "content_text": "The Santa Ana winds were already blowing hard when I ran the first worm simulation. I’m no hacker, but it was easy enough: Open a Terminal shell, paste some commands from GitHub, watch characters cascade down the screen. Just like in the movies. I was scanning the passing code for recognizable words—neuron, synapse—when a friend came to pick me up for dinner. “One sec,” I yelled from my office. “I’m just running a worm on my computer.”\nAt the Korean restaurant, the energy was manic; the wind was bending palm trees at the waist and sending shopping carts skating across the parking lot. The atmosphere felt heightened and unreal, like a podcast at double speed. You’re doing, what, a cybercrime? my friend asked. Over the din, I tried to explain: No, not a worm like Stuxnet. A worm like Richard Scarry.\nBy the time I got home it was dark, and the first sparks had already landed in Altadena. On my laptop, waiting for me in a volumetric pixel box, was the worm. Pointed at each end, it floated in a mist of particles, eerily stick-straight and motionless. It was, of course, not alive. Still, it looked deader than dead to me. “Bravo,” said Stephen Larson, when I reached him later that night. “You have achieved the ‘hello world’ state of the simulation.”\nLarson is a cofounder of OpenWorm, an open source software effort that has been trying, since 2011, to build a computer simulation of a microscopic nematode called Caenorhabditis elegans. His goal is nothing less than a digital twin of the real worm, accurate down to the molecule. If OpenWorm can manage this, it would be the first virtual animal—and an embodiment of all our knowledge not only about C. elegans, which is one of the most-studied animals in science, but about how brains interact with the world to produce behavior: the “holy grail,” as OpenWorm puts it, of systems biology.\nUnfortunately, they haven’t managed it. The simulation on my laptop takes data culled from experiments done with living worms and translates it into a computational framework called c302, which then drives the simulated musculature of a C. elegans worm in a fluid dynamic environment—all in all, a simulation of how a worm squiggles forward in a flat plate of goo. It takes about 10 hours of compute time to generate five seconds of this behavior.\nSo much can happen in 10 hours. An ember can travel on the wind, down from the foothills and into the sleeping city. That night, on Larson’s advice, I tweaked the time parameters of the simulation, pushing beyond “hello world” and deeper into the worm’s uncanny valley. The next morning, I woke to an eerie orange haze, and when I pulled open my laptop, bleary-eyed, two things made my heart skip: Los Angeles was on fire. And my worm had moved.\nAt this point, you may be asking yourself a very reasonable question. Back at the Korean place, between bites of banchan, my friend had asked it too. The question is this: Uhh … why? Why, in the face of everything our precarious green world endures, of all the problems out there to solve, would anyone spend 13 years trying to code a microscopic worm into existence?\nBy way of an answer, I’ll offer one of the physicist Richard Feynman’s most famous dictums: What I cannot create, I do not understand. For much of its history, biology has been a reductionist science, driven by the principle that the best way to understand the mind-boggling complexity of living things is to dissect them into their constituent parts—organs, cells, proteins, molecules. But life isn’t a clockwork; it’s a dynamic system, and unexpected things emerge from the interactions between all those little parts. To truly understand life, you can’t just break it down. You have to be able to put it back together, too.\nThe C. elegans nematode is a tiny worm, barely as long as a hair is wide, with less than a thousand cells in its body. Of those, only 302 are neurons—about as small as a brain can get. “I remember, when my first child was born, how proud I was when they reached the age they could count to 302,” said Netta Cohen, a computational neuroscientist who runs a worm lab at the University of Leeds. But there’s no shame in smallness, Cohen emphasized: C. elegans does a lot with a little. Unlike its more unpleasant cousins, it’s not a parasite, outsourcing its survival needs to bigger organisms. Instead, it’s what biologists call a “free-living” animal. “It can reproduce, it can eat, it can forage, it can escape,” Cohen said. “It’s born and it develops, and it ages and it dies—all in a millimeter.”\nWorm people like Cohen are quick to tell you that no fewer than four Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work on C. elegans, which was the first animal to have both its genome sequenced and its neurons mapped. But there’s a difference between schematics and an operating manual. “We know the wiring; we don’t know the dynamics,” Cohen said. “You would think that’s an ideal problem for a physicist or a computer scientist or a mathematician to solve.”\nThey’ve certainly tried. C. elegans’ first simulator was Sydney Brenner, who elevated the lowly worm from compost pile to scientific superstardom with his landmark 1986 paper “The Structure of the Nervous System of the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,” reverently known in worm circles as “The Mind of a Worm.” In a lab in Cambridge, England, Brenner’s team spent 13 years painstakingly slicing worms and photographing them through an electron microscope, relying on a first-generation minicomputer—the kind programmed with punched-paper tape—to reconstitute their data into a rudimentary map of the worm’s nervous system.\nEvery 10 or 20 years since, computer scientists have attempted to expand on Brenner’s work. But biology tends to quickly humble the computer people. In 2003, the computer scientist David Harel pronounced the simulation of C. elegans a “grand challenge” for biology, a field that he considered overdue for an “extremely significant transition from analysis to synthesis.” Although Harel was surely right about that, he never managed to model more than the worm’s vulva—true story.\nFor her part, Cohen has spent the better part of 20 years publishing breakthrough computational models that account for the sinusoidal squirm of C. elegans as it inches forward through different viscosities. But how the worm moves backward is an entirely different, unsolved problem—and don’t even ask about how a worm moves up and down, or, for that matter, why. All of the data we have about C. elegans behavior comes from worms in flat agar plates. For all we know, they might do things completely differently in the wild. “Why not?” Cohen said with a laugh. “It’s biology.”\nWhen OpenWorm announced its intentions in 2011, Stephen Larson, an engineer who had “found religion” in open source, believed that if he could just convene a group of dedicated computational researchers to take a crack at biology, they might make meaningful progress on a simulation. Thirteen years later, he’s more contrite. “The project might be a cathedral,” Larson told me. “If I don’t have the ability to finish it, then at least other people can see it and build on it.”\nThis could be burnout talking; spearheading an open source project on a shoestring, for any amount of time, can sap even the most dedicated idealist. It could be the deceptive complexity of C. elegans’ brain, which continues to defy easy capture. It could also just be bad timing.\nOpenWorm doesn’t do its own research. Instead, the project’s cohort of volunteers culls from the C. elegans literature, integrating into their simulation whatever data they can find. This means they’re reliant on worm labs like Cohen’s, which have been slow to produce the kind of inputs that are really useful for a computational effort. But over the past decade or so, experimentalists have powered up microscopes and refined genetic techniques, producing more and better recordings of the worm’s brain as it goes about its business. At the same time, machine-learning tools have emerged to make sense of all that data, and computational power is through the roof. The convergence makes Larson hopeful. “When you’re in a time of almost exponential technological expansion, something that sounds crazy is maybe doable,” he said.\nI asked Cohen, who serves on OpenWorm’s scientific advisory panel, if it is, in fact, doable. “Well, let’s start from the premise that it is,” she said. “What do we need to do?” Cohen is one of 37 coauthors on a recent opinion paper outlining a new plan: Use genetic imaging technology to activate each neuron in the worm’s nervous system one by one, measuring its effect on the other 301. Repeated hundreds of thousands of times in parallel experiments, this methodical process should hoover up enough data to give the computational folks, finally, something to work with—enough, even, to “reverse engineer” the worm completely.\nIt’s an ambitious proposal, one that will require an unprecedented level of collaboration between some 20 different worm labs. Gal Haspel, a computational neuroscientist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and the lead author on the reverse engineering paper, estimates that pulling it off may take up to 10 years, cost tens of millions of dollars, and require something in the neighborhood of 100,000 to 200,000 real-life worms. In the process, it will generate more data about C. elegans than has been collected in all of science to date. And what, in the end, will the reverse engineers have to show for it? “All these people and all these computers,” Haspel said. “And we’ll end up doing what one little animal can do right now.”\nHe’s being wry. Haspel also compared the project to a NASA moonshot: It’s the kind of undertaking that drives technology forward, pushing engineers to build better tools and scientists to work together. The worm simulation is an opportunity, Haspel believes, for a new kind of science, one driven by automation, big data, and machine learning. And although the end product is only a worm, and an expensive, inefficient one at that—in a sense the world’s most sophisticated Tamagotchi—it can be a stepping stone toward understanding more complex nervous systems and eventually, someday, the human mind.\nLast summer, a crypto developer posted an animated GIF on X of a virtual C. elegans worm bonking around an onscreen window. The animation was generated using the same code I ran on my own laptop, which is freely available on OpenWorm’s GitHub. “If the worm matrix runs on my M1 Mac,” he pronounced, “what are the chances we are actually in base reality?” Maybe we’re the worms, he meant—and, on a cosmic MacBook on some higher plane of reality, someone’s running us. The post went viral; Elon Musk, of course, liked it.\nWhen I mentioned the worm matrix to OpenWorm’s project director, Padraig Gleeson, a computational neuroscientist at University College London, he visibly winced. “Some people come to this because they want philosophical discussions about this type of thing. That’s fine,” he said. “My priority is that it’d be very nice to actually look at the biology.”\nGleeson is the Woz to Larson’s Jobs—he’s less interested in building the Überworm than he is in a platform that bundles smaller, more granular models of C. elegans’ biological machinery. Computational modeling is common practice in biology; it’s an inexpensive way to encode and test theories as “thought experiments” before breaking out the agar plates and worm food. Usually, biological models concern some small aspect of the organism being studied—the handful of neurons, say, driving forward locomotion. When it comes to modeling, “we don’t want the map to be as good as the territory. That would defeat the purpose,” explained Eduardo Izquierdo, a computational neuroscientist at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology who focuses on worm modeling. “We’re looking for something to help us think through things.”\nNobody would confuse a biological model with the real thing. But a full-on simulation opens a very different can of worms. To borrow Izquierdo’s reference, it is a map as good as the territory—and as such, it invites new speculation about the nature of that territory, to say nothing of life itself. If a model helps scientists answer questions, a simulation raises them. Like, what separates a virtual worm from its living kin, if the two are identical down to the molecule?\nThe way Larson sees it, a fully faithful worm simulation will be a category-expanding event: Rather than invalidating our current understanding of life, it might broaden it. “If we want to say that aliveness can only be satisfied by systems of physical molecules that physically exist with mass in the planet, something in a computer that doesn’t have physical molecules cannot be alive,” he said. “But if we expand our definition of aliveness to instead be more about information, then perhaps there is a version of aliveness that you could apply to a simulated animal. And then the question is, does it matter?”\nI think it matters. Life is information, but it’s something more, too—something we feel most strongly when it’s gone. I wonder if, in this light, Feynman’s dictum shouldn’t be amended. It’s not that creation breeds understanding, exactly. It’s that only by attempting to re-create life can we come to understand how irreplaceable it is.\nOf course, I say this because I’m surrounded by destruction. The air is toxic now, and flakes of white ash have eddied into every crevice of the house. At the edge of the evacuation zone, close enough to smell the smoke, I’m keeping myself distracted by cooking up more and more C. elegans proto-simulations. Watching them, I can’t help but marvel at how easy it is to destroy life, and how difficult it is to create it. All it takes is a single spark to torch centuries of growth overnight—but to prompt one sluggish inch forward from a virtual worm? That’s the work of decades, and it may never be finished.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

    "content_text": "This story was produced by Grist and copublished with Wired. It was supported by the Pulitzer Center.\nGreenland’s massive cap of ice, containing enough fresh water to raise sea levels by 23 feet, is in serious trouble. Between 2002 and 2023, Greenland lost 270 billion tons of frozen water each year as winter snowfall failed to compensate for ever-fiercer summer temperatures. That's a significant contributor of sea level rise globally, which is now at a quarter of an inch a year.\nBut underneath all that melting ice is something the whole world wants: the rare earth elements that make modern society—and the clean energy revolution—possible. That could soon turn Greenland, which has a population size similar to that of Casper, Wyoming, into a mining mecca.\nGreenland’s dominant industry has long been fishing, but its government is now looking to diversify its economy. While the island has opened up a handful of mines, like for gold and rubies, its built and natural environment makes drilling a nightmare—freezing conditions on remote sites without railways or highways for access. The country's rich reserves of rare earths and geopolitical conflict, however, are making the island look increasingly enticing to mining companies, Arctic conditions be damned.\nWhen President Donald Trump talks about the United States acquiring Greenland, it’s partly for its strategic trade and military location in the Arctic but also for its mineral resources. According to one Greenland official, the island “possesses 39 of the 50 minerals that the United States has classified as critical to national security and economic stability.” While the island, an autonomous territory of Denmark, has made clear it is not for sale, its government is signaling it is open to business, particularly in the minerals sector. Earlier this month, Greenland’s elections saw the ascendance of the pro-business Demokraatit Party, which has promised to accelerate the development of the country’s minerals and other resources. At the same time, the party’s leadership is pushing back hard against Trump’s rhetoric.\nRare earth elements are fundamental to daily life: These words you are reading on a screen are made of the ones and zeroes of binary code. But they’re also made of rare earth elements, such as the terbium in LED screens, praseodymium in batteries, and neodymium in a phone’s vibration unit. Depending on where you live, the electricity powering this screen may have even come from the dysprosium in wind turbines.\nThese minerals helped build the modern world—and will be in increasing demand going forward. “They sit at the heart of pretty much every electric vehicle, cruise missile, advanced magnet,” said Adam Lajeunesse, a public policy expert at Canada's St. Francis Xavier University. “All of these different minerals are absolutely required to build almost everything that we do in our high-tech environment.”\nTo the increasing alarm of Western powers, China now has a stranglehold on the market for rare earth elements, responsible for 70 percent of production globally. As the renewables revolution unfolds, and as more EVs hit the road, the world will demand ever more of these metals: Between 2020 and 2022, the total value of rare earths used in the energy transition each year quadrupled. That is projected to go up another tenfold by 2035. According to the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, by 2030, Greenland could provide nearly 10,000 tons of rare earth oxides to the global economy.\nOne way to meet that demand, and for the world to diversify control over the rare earths market and speed up clean energy adoption, is to mine in Greenland. (In other words, the way to avoid future ice melt may, ironically, mean capitalizing on the riches revealed by climate-driven ice loss.) On the land currently exposed along the island’s edges, mining companies are starting to drill, and the US doesn’t want to be left out of the action.\nBut anyone gung-ho on immediately turning Greenland into a rare earths bonanza is in for a rude awakening. More so than elsewhere on the planet, mining the island is an extremely complicated, and lengthy, proposition—logistically, geopolitically, and economically. And most importantly for the people of Greenland, mining of any kind comes with inevitable environmental consequences, like pollution and disruptions to wildlife.\nThe Trump administration’s aggressive language has spooked Indigenous Greenlanders in particular, who make up 90 percent of the population and have endured a long history of brutal colonization, from deadly waves of disease and displacement to forced sterilization. “It's been a shock for Greenland,” said Aqqaluk Lynge, former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council and cofounder of Greenland’s Inuit Ataqatigiit political party. “They are looking at us as people that you just can throw out.”\nLacking the resources to directly invest in mining for rare earths, the Greenland government is approving licenses for exploration. “We have all the critical minerals. Everyone wants them,” said Jørgen T. Hammeken-Holm, permanent secretary for mineral resources in the Greenland government. “The geology is so exciting, but there are a lot of ‘buts.’”\nThe funny thing about rare earth elements is that they’re not particularly rare. Planet Earth is loaded with them—only in an annoyingly distributed manner. Miners have to process a lot of rock to pluck out small amounts of praseodymium, neodymium, and the 15 other rare earth elements. That makes the minerals very difficult and dirty to mine and then refine: For every ton of rare earths dug up, 2,000 tons of toxic waste are generated.\nChina’s government cornered the market on rare earths by both subsidizing the industry and streamlining regulations. “If you can purchase something from a Chinese company which does not have the same labor regulations, human rights considerations, environmental considerations as you would in Australia or California, you'll buy it more cheaply on the Chinese market,” Lajeunesse said. Many critical minerals that are mined elsewhere in the world still go back to China, because the country has spent decades building up its refining capacity.\nChina has used the rare earths market as an economic and political weapon. In 2010, the so-called Rare Earths Trade Dispute broke out, when China refused to ship the minerals to Japan—a country famous for its manufacturing of technologies. (However, some researchers question whether this was a deliberate embargo or a Chinese effort to reduce rare earth exports generally.) More subtly, China can manipulate the market on rare earths by, say, increasing production to drive down prices. This makes it less economically feasible for other mining outfits to get into the game, given the cost and difficulty of extracting the minerals, solidifying China’s grip on rare earths.\n“They control every stage—the mining of it, and then the intermediate processing, and then the more sophisticated final product processing,” said Heather Exner-Pirot, director of energy, natural resources and environment at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a think tank in Canada. “So they can intervene in the market at all these levels.”\nThis is a precarious monopoly for Western economies and governments to navigate. Military aircraft and drones use permanent magnets made of terbium and dysprosium. Medical imaging equipment also relies on rare earths, as do flatscreens and electric motors. It’s not just the energy transition that needs a steady supply of these minerals, but modern life itself.\nAs a result, all eyes are turning toward Greenland’s rich deposits of rare earths. The island contains 18 percent of the global reserves for neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium, according to the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre. Even a decade ago, scientists reported that the island could meet a quarter of the global demand for rare earths.\nThe question is whether mining companies can overcome the headaches inherent in extracting rare earths from Greenland’s ice-free yet still frigid edges. An outfit would have to ship in all their equipment and build their own city at a remote mining site at considerable cost. On top of that, it would be difficult to actually hire enough workers from the island’s population of laborers, so a mining company may need to hire internationally and bring them in. Greenland has a population of 57,000, just 65 of whom were involved in mining as of 2020, so the requisite experience just isn’t there. “Labor laws are much more strict than they would be in a Chinese rare earth mine in Mongolia,” Lajeunesse said. “All of those things factor together to make Arctic development very expensive.”\nStill, the geopolitical pressure from China’s domination of the rare earths market has opened Greenland to exploration. No one needs to wait for further deterioration of the island’s ice sheet to get to work, as there’s enough ice-free land along these edges to dig through. Around 40 mining companies have exploration, prospecting, and exploitation licenses in Greenland, with the majority of the firms based in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. “We can give you these minerals,” Hammeken-Holm said, “but you need to come to Greenland and do the exploration.”\nOne of those companies is Critical Metals Corp., which in September drilled 14 holes on the coast of southern Greenland, about 16 miles from the town of Qaqortoq. The New York-based company says it’s found one of the world’s highest concentrations of gallium, which isn’t technically a rare earth element but is still essential in the manufacturing of computer chips.\nDramatic change on and around the island, though, could make mining for rare earths even more complicated. While the loss of floating ice in the waters around the island makes it easier and safer for ships to navigate, more chunks of glaciers will drop into the ocean as the world warms, which could become especially hazardous for ships, à la the Titanic.\nEven given the rapid loss of Greenland’s 650,000-square-mile ice sheet, though, it would take a long while to lose it all—it’s 1.4 miles thick on average. The Earth itself is also frozen in parts of the island, known as permafrost, which will thaw in the nearer term as temperatures rise. “That's going to give you certainly instability in terms of building access roads and such,” said Paul Bierman, a geologist at the University of Vermont and author of the book When the Ice Is Gone: What a Greenland Ice Core Reveals About Earth's Tumultuous History and Perilous Future. “The climate is changing, so I think it's going to be a very dynamic environment in which to extract minerals.”\nMining pollution, too, is a major concern: The accessible land along the island’s ice-free edges is also where humans live. As mining equipment and ships burn fossil fuels, they produce black carbon. When this settles on ice, it darkens the surface, which then absorbs more sunlight—think of how much hotter you get wearing a black shirt than a white shirt on a summer day. This could further accelerate the melting of Greenland’s precarious ice sheet. A 2022 study also found that three legacy mines in Greenland heavily polluted the local environment with metals, like lead and zinc, due to the lack of environmental studies and regulation prior to the 1970s. But it also found no significant pollution at mines established in the last 20 years.\nA more immediate problem with mining is the potentially toxic dust generated by so much machinery, said Niels Henrik Hooge, a campaigner at NOAH, the Danish chapter of the environmental organization Friends of the Earth. “That's a concern, because all the mining projects are located in areas where people live, or potentially could live,” Hooge said. “Everything is a bit different in the Arctic, because the environment does not recover very quickly when polluted.”\nLynge says that a win-win for Greenlanders would be to support mining but insist that it’s run on hydropower instead of fossil fuels. The island has huge potential for hydropower, and indeed has been approving more projects and expanding another existing facility. Still, no amount of hydropower can negate the impact of mining on the landscape. “There's no sustainable mining in the world,” Lynge said. “The question is if we can do it a little bit better.”\nCritical Metals Corp., for its part, says that it expects to produce minimal harmful products at its site. Like other mining projects in Greenland, it will need to pass an environmental review. “We expect to provide more updates about our plans to reduce our environmental footprint as we get closer to mining operations,” said Tony Sage, the company’s CEO and executive chairman, in a statement provided to Grist. “With that, we believe it is important to keep in mind that rare earth elements are critical materials for cleaner applications, which will help us build a greener planet in the future.”\nStill, wherever there’s mining activity, there’s potential for spills. There’s also potential for a lot of noise: Ships in particular fill the ocean around Greenland with a din that can stress and disorient fishes and marine mammals, like narwhals, seals, and whales. For vocalizing species, it can disrupt their communication.\nThere’s a lot at stake here economically and politically, too: Fishing is Greenland’s predominant industry, accounting for 95 percent of the island’s exports. Rare earth mining, then, is the island’s play to diversify its economy, which could help it wean off the subsidies it gets from the Danish government. That, in turn, could help it win independence.\nThus far, the mining business has been a bit rocky in Greenland. In 2021, the government banned uranium mining, halting the development of a project by the Australian outfit Greenland Minerals, which would have also produced rare earths at the site. (Greenland Minerals did not respond to multiple requests to comment for this story.) The China-linked company is now suing the Greenland government for $11 billion—potentially spooking other would-be prospectors and the investors already worried about the profitability of mining for rare earths in the far north.\n“When we talk to them, they understand the situation, and they're not afraid,” said Hammeken-Holm. He added that Greenland maintains a dialogue with mining outfits about the challenges, and prospects, of exploration. “It is difficult to get private finance for these projects, but we are not alone,” he said. “That's a worldwide situation.”\nThe growing demand and geopolitical fervor around rare earths may well make Greenland irresistible for mining companies, regardless of the logistical challenges. Hammeken-Holm says that a major discovery, like an especially rich deposit of a given rare earth element, might be the extra boost the country needs to transform itself into an indispensable provider of the critical minerals.\nBoth Exner-Pirot, of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, and Lajeunesse, the public policy expert, say that Western powers might get to the point where they intervene aggressively in the market. Like China’s state-sponsored rare earths industry, the US, Canada, Australia, or the European Union—which entered into a strategic partnership with Greenland in 2023 to develop critical raw materials—might band together to guarantee a steady flow of the minerals that make modern militaries, consumerism, and the energy transition possible. Subsidies, for instance, would help make the industry more profitable—and palatable for investors. “You'd have to accept that you're purchasing and developing minerals for more than the market price,” Lajeunesse said. “But over the long term, it's about developing a security of supply.”\nAlready a land of rapid climatological change, Greenland could soon grow richer—and more powerful on the world stage. Ton by ton, its disappearing ice will reveal more of the mineral solutions to the world’s woes.\nTom Vaillant contributed research and reporting.

Subsidies, for instance, would help make the industry more profitable—and palatable for investors. “You'd have to accept that you're purchasing and developing minerals for more than the market price,” Lajeunesse said. “But over the long term, it's about developing a security of supply.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Already a land of rapid climatological change, Greenland could soon grow richer—and more powerful on the world stage. Ton by ton, its disappearing ice will reveal more of the mineral solutions to the world’s woes.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><em>Tom Vaillant contributed research and reporting.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nSince 2014, Womanizer has been satisfying people with vulvas all over the world. Thanks to its revolutionary Pleasure Air Technology that mimics the feeling of oral sex, not only has Womanizer discovered a way to stimulate the 10,000+ nerve endings in the clitoris in a way that hadn’t been done by a sex toy before—yes, they were the first—but the brand can even boast a 100% orgasm rate among users.\nAs a company that puts sexual pleasure front and center, Womanizer has continued to add to their very impressive lineup of orgasm-inducing toys. They’ve even branched out by creating products like the Womanizer Duo and Womanizer Duo 2, both of which stimulate the clitoris and G-spot simultaneously. (Blended orgasm, anyone?) As recently as March 2025, Womanizer launched their latest toy, Womanizer Enhance, the first toy of its kind because it allows the user to choose between the Pleasure Air Technology or traditional vibrations. I was fortunate enough to review the Enhance for WIRED, giving it a 7/10 because of its ability to stand by its word and deliver me one heck of an orgasm.\nBut because the Enhance is just one of dozens of Womanizer products that have hit the market in the last 11 years, I’m the first to admit that it can be difficult to choose which one is best for you. That’s where Womanizer coupons come into play—because no one should have to decide on just one of their fantastic sex toys.\nSave 12% on Everything With Our Exclusive Womanizer Coupon\nIf you’ve been wanting to try Womanizer, but you were holding out for a sale or deal, then I’m happy to announce that we have a great one for you. At checkout, use the Womanizer promo code AFF-WIREDWMZ and you’ll score 12% off everything sitewide, including sale products.\nOverwhelmed and not sure where you should begin your Womanizer journey? Womanizer Premium is the perfect start to a life-long love affair with Womanizer. It’s easy to use, has 12 intensity levels, and you can even set it to Womanizer Autopilot so you can focus 100% on being in the moment. It’s also waterproof should you want to experiment with its sensations in the shower or bathtub.\nGet 15% off Sitewide With a Womanizer Coupon Code\nLooking to level up on the Womanizer deals? If you sign up on the website, you’ll get a Womanizer coupon code emailed directly to you. Valid for seven days, this unique code will get you 15% off everything on the site and can even be combined with other Womanizer discounts.\nThis gives you a great opportunity to purchase the Womanizer Premium 2, so your original Premium has a buddy. If you travel a lot for work or for pleasure and need something smaller, but just as powerful, then put that promo code toward the Womanizer Liberty 2 or Womanizer Starlet Snow. Both are ideal for the person who’s always on the go, but also prioritizes sexual pleasure.\nShop Womanizer Sales and Get up to 50% off Sex Toys\nWomanizer isn’t just great at keeping people with vulva knee-deep in orgasms, but doing so with your budget in mind. Because sexual pleasure should be affordable and accessible for everyone, the Womanizer sale offers up to 50% off certain products at all times. It’s a great selection of Womanizer sale items that showcase just how diverse the brand is. On the sale page, you won’t just find Pleasure Air Technology sex toys, but vibrators and penis strokers too. It’s a great way to get yourself a little something and feel good knowing that it was a total bargain.\nHow to Get a Free Toy With Purchase\nLet’s be honest: the best things in life are free. Because Womanizer knows that and realizes we all deserve a freebie from time-to-time, they want to make your day. With every Womanizer order over $199, you get a free Womanizer toy at checkout. Choose between the Womanizer OG, the Womanizer Classic 2, or We-Vibe Bond. All of which make a fabulous gift for yourself from Womanizer or a gift for someone you love.\nEnjoy Free Shipping on Your Womanizer Order\nNo matter what coupon code you’re using, sale items you’re purchasing, or discounts you have, every Womanizer order over $30 gets you free shipping all year round. If you don’t like your product for whatever reason, know that as a Womanizer customer you can shop for sex toys risk-free thanks to their 100 Day Pleasure Guarantee. Also, all products include a 5-year warranty, so that you can be assured of their quality.\nSave 15% With a Womanizer Student Discount\nIf you’re still in school, Womanizer offers 15% off all products with its student discount. You just need to register your phone number to verify your student status. If you’re no longer a student, but are a graduate, teacher, healthcare worker, first responder, low-income, military personnel, a parent, or a charity worker, you too can enjoy 15% off everything. Womanizer has teamed up with Student Beans and Beans iD to offer exclusive discounts for a range of different groups. Sexual pleasure is a human right and Womanizer wants all of us to exercise that right with the help of discounts and coupon codes.",

    "content_text": "Late Saturday night, technicians at Kennedy Space Center in Florida moved the core stage for NASA’s second Space Launch System rocket into position between the vehicle’s two solid-fueled boosters.\nWorking inside the iconic 52-story-tall Vehicle Assembly Building, ground teams used heavy-duty cranes to first lift the butterscotch-orange core stage from its cradle in the VAB’s cavernous transfer aisle, the central passageway between the building’s four rocket assembly bays. The cranes then rotated the structure vertically, allowing workers to disconnect one of the cranes from the bottom of the rocket.\nThat left the rocket hanging on a 325-ton overhead crane, which would lift it over the transom into the building’s northeast high bay. The Boeing-built core stage weighs about 94 tons (85 metric tons), measures about 212 feet (65 meters) tall, and will contain 730,000 gallons of cryogenic propellant at liftoff. It is the single largest element for NASA’s Artemis II mission, slated to ferry a crew of astronauts around the far side of the moon as soon as next year.\nFinally, ground crews lowered the rocket between the Space Launch System’s twin solid rocket boosters already stacked on a mobile launch platform inside High Bay 3, where NASA assembled Space Shuttles and Saturn V rockets for Apollo lunar missions.\nOn Sunday, teams inside the VAB connected the core stage to each booster at forward and aft load-bearing attach points. After completing electrical and data connections, engineers will stack a cone-shaped adapter on top of the core stage, followed by the rocket’s upper stage, another adapter ring, and finally the Orion spacecraft that will be home to the four-person Artemis II crew for their 10-day journey through deep space.\nCaption: Four RS-25 engines left over from NASA’s Space Shuttle program will power the SLS core stage.\nCredit: NASA/Frank Michaux\nThrough the Motions\nThis will be the first crewed flight of NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the lunar south pole and eventually build a sustainable human presence on the moon, with an eye toward future expeditions to Mars. The program’s first crewed lunar landing is penciled in for the Artemis III mission, again using SLS and Orion, but adding a new piece: SpaceX’s enormous Starship rocket will be used as a human-rated lunar lander. Artemis II won’t land, but it will carry people to the vicinity of the moon for the first time since 1972.\nThe core stage for Artemis II arrived from its factory in Louisiana last year, and NASA started stacking the SLS solid rocket boosters in November. Other recent accomplishments on the path toward Artemis II include the installation of the Orion spacecraft’s solar panels, and closeouts of the craft’s service module at Kennedy Space Center with aerodynamic panels that will jettison during launch.\nAs soon as next month, the Orion spacecraft will travel to a different facility at Kennedy for fueling, then to another building to meet its Launch Abort System before moving to the VAB for stacking atop the Space Launch System. Ahead of the uncrewed Artemis I mission in 2022, it took around eight months to complete these activities before delivering Orion to the VAB, so it’s fair to be skeptical of NASA’s target launch date for Artemis II in April 2026, which is already running years behind schedule.\nHowever, the slow march toward launch continues. A few months ago, some well-informed people in the space community thought there was a real possibility the Trump administration could quickly cancel NASA’s Space Launch System, the high-priced heavy-lifter designed to send astronauts from the Earth to the moon. The most immediate possibility involved terminating the SLS program before it flies with Artemis II.\nThis possibility appears to have been overcome by circumstances. The rockets most often mentioned as stand-ins for the Space Launch System—SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s New Glenn—aren’t likely to be cleared for crew missions for at least several years.\nThe fully reusable Starship holds immense long-term promise to be significantly cheaper and more capable than the Space Launch System, but it suffered back-to-back failures to start the year, raising questions about SpaceX’s upgraded Starship design, known as “Version 2” or “Block 2.” Once SpaceX irons out the design issues, it must prove it can recover and reuse Starships and test the vehicle’s in-orbit refueling capabilities. Blue Origin’s New Glenn had a successful debut flight in January, but its next flight is likely six or more months away.\nNASA’s existing architecture still has a limited shelf life, and the agency will probably have multiple options for transporting astronauts to and from the moon in the 2030s. A decision on the long-term future of SLS and Orion isn’t expected until the Trump administration’s nominee for NASA administrator, Jared Isaacman, takes office after confirmation by the Senate.\nSo, What Is the Plan for SLS?\nThere are different degrees of cancellation options. The most draconian would be an immediate order to stop work on Artemis II preparations. This is looking less likely than it did a few months ago and would come with its own costs. It would cost untold millions of dollars to disassemble and dispose of parts of Artemis II’s SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft. Canceling multibillion-dollar contracts with Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed Martin would put NASA on the hook for significant termination costs.\nOf course, these liabilities would be less than the $4.1 billion NASA’s inspector general estimates each of the first four Artemis missions will cost. Most of that money has already been spent for Artemis II, but if NASA spends several billion dollars on each Artemis mission, there won’t be much money left over to do other cool things.\nOther options for NASA might be to set a transition point when the Artemis program would move off of the Space Launch System rocket, and perhaps even the Orion spacecraft, and switch to new vehicles.\nAnother possibility, which seems to be low-hanging fruit for Artemis decision-makers, could be to cancel the development of a larger Exploration Upper Stage for the SLS rocket. If there are a finite number of SLS flights on NASA’s schedule, it’s difficult to justify the projected $5.7 billion cost of developing the upgraded Block 1B version of the Space Launch System. There are commercial options available to replace the rocket’s Boeing-built Exploration Upper Stage, as my colleague Eric Berger aptly described in a feature story last year.\nFor now, it looks like NASA’s orange behemoth has a little life left in it. All the hardware for the Artemis II mission has arrived at the launch site in Florida.\nThe Trump administration will release its fiscal-year 2026 budget request in the coming weeks. Maybe then NASA will also have a permanent administrator, and the veil will lift over the White House’s plans for Artemis.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "Databricks, a company that helps big businesses build custom artificial intelligence models, has developed a machine-learning trick that can boost the performance of an AI model without the need for clean labeled data.\nJonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, spent the past year talking to customers about the key challenges they face in getting AI to work reliably.\nThe problem, Frankle says, is dirty data.\n”Everybody has some data, and has an idea of what they want to do,” Frankle says. But the lack of clean data makes it challenging to fine-tune a model to perform a specific task. “Nobody shows up with nice, clean fine-tuning data that you can stick into a prompt or an [application programming interface]” for a model.\nDatabricks’ model could allow companies to eventually deploy their own agents to perform tasks, without data quality standing in the way.\nThe technique offers a rare look at some of the key tricks that engineers are now using to improve the abilities of advanced AI models, especially when good data is hard to come by. The method leverages ideas that have helped produce advanced reasoning models by combining reinforcement learning, a way for AI models to improve through practice, with “synthetic,” or AI-generated, training data.\nThe latest models from OpenAI, Google, and DeepSeek all rely heavily on reinforcement learning as well as synthetic training data. WIRED revealed that Nvidia plans to acquire Gretel, a company that specializes in synthetic data. “We're all navigating this space,” Frankle says.\nThe Databricks method exploits the fact that, given enough tries, even a weak model can score well on a given task or benchmark. Researchers call this method of boosting a model’s performance “best-of-N.” Databricks trained a model to predict which best-of-N result human testers would prefer, based on examples. The Databricks reward model, or DBRM, can then be used to improve the performance of other models without the need for further labeled data.\nDBRM is then used to select the best outputs from a given model. This creates synthetic training data for further fine-tuning the model so that it produces a better output the first time. Databricks calls its new approach Test-time Adaptive Optimization or TAO. “This method we're talking about uses some relatively lightweight reinforcement learning to basically bake the benefits of best-of-N into the model itself,” Frankle says.\nHe adds that the research done by Databricks shows that the TAO method improves as it is scaled up to larger, more capable models. Reinforcement learning and synthetic data are already widely used, but combining them in order to improve language models is a relatively new and technically challenging technique.\nDatabricks is unusually open about how it develops AI, because it wants to show customers that it has the skills needed to create powerful custom models for them. The company previously revealed to WIRED how it developed DBX, a cutting-edge open source large language model (LLM) from scratch.\nWithout well-labeled, carefully curated data, it is challenging to fine-tune an LLM to do specific tasks more effectively, such as analyzing financial reports or health records to find patterns or identify problems. Many companies now hope to use LLMs to automate tasks with so-called agents.\nAn agent used in finance might, for example, analyze a company’s key performance then generate a report and automatically send it to different analysts. One used in health insurance might help guide customers toward information about a relevant drug or condition.\nDatabricks tested the TAO approach on FinanceBench, a benchmark that tests how well language models answer financial questions. On this benchmark, Llama 3.1B, the smallest of Meta’s free AI models, scores 68.4 percent compared to 82.1 percent for OpenAI’s proprietary GPT-4o and o3-mini models. Using the TAO technique, Databricks got Llama 3.1B to score 82.8 percent on FinanceBench, surpassing OpenAI’s models.\n“The general idea is very promising,” says Christopher Amato, a computer scientist at Northeastern University who works on reinforcement learning. “I do completely agree that the lack of good training data is a big problem.”\nAmato says that many companies are now searching for ways to train AI models with synthetic data and reinforcement learning. The TAO method, “is very promising, as it could allow much more scalable data labeling and even improved performance over time as the models get stronger and the labels get better over time,” he says.\nAmato adds, however, that reinforcement learning can sometimes behave in unpredictable ways, meaning that it needs to be used with care.\nFrankle says that DataBricks is using the TAO technique to boost the performance of customers’ AI models and help them build their first agents. One customer, which makes a health-tracking app, has found that the TAO approach allowed it to deploy an AI model that was not previously reliable enough. “You want [the app] to be medically accurate,” he says. “This is a tricky problem.”",

    "content_text": "The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is discussing plans to eliminate an entire team responsible for publishing and maintaining critical atomic measurement data in the coming weeks, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to reduce the US federal workforce, according to a March 18 email sent to dozens of outside scientists. The data in question underpins advanced scientific research around the world in areas like semiconductor manufacturing and nuclear fusion.\n“We were recently informed that unless there is a major change in the Federal Government reorganization plans, the whole Atomic Spectroscopy Group will be laid off in a few weeks, in particular, since our work is not considered to be statutorily essential for the NIST mission,” Yuri Ralchenko, the group's leader, wrote in the email, which was seen by WIRED.\nRalchenko noted that atomic spectroscopy has been used to discover many new exoplanets and develop powerful new diagnostic techniques, among other applications. “Unfortunately, the story of atomic spectroscopy at NIST is coming to an end,” he wrote.\nIn response to a request for comment from WIRED, Ralchenko said he wasn’t permitted to speak about budget and management issues and referred questions to NIST’s public affairs department. NIST and its parent agency, the Department of Commerce, did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Atomic Spectroscopy Group studies how atoms absorb or emit light, allowing researchers to identify the elements present in a given sample. It then collects and updates those calculations in the Atomic Spectra Database, a catalog of industry-leading spectroscopy information and measurements that plays a crucial role in fields like astronomy, astrophysics, and medicine. In a blog post published last week highlighting the importance of the database, NIST said it receives an average of 70,000 search requests worldwide each month.\nIt is “really difficult to overestimate” the importance of this data, says Evgeny Stambulchik, a senior staff research scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel who started a petition to gather signatures from other researchers and members of the public who oppose the cuts to the atomic spectroscopy team. The petition currently has over 1,700 signatures.\nStambulchik, whose speciality is plasma spectroscopy, says that atomic spectroscopy is essentially the only tool that can be used to interpret remote objects in space, like those observed by the powerful James Webb telescope. It’s also basically the only tool for investigating “matter at temperatures reaching tens of million degrees,” he adds, such as inside a nuclear fusion reactor.\nAnother plasma physicist at a US institution who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak to the media said they use this data daily to build reliable models for designing future fusion reactors. “Losing this trusted data source would hinder private fusion companies,\" they explain.\nThe US scientist says the data provided by NIST’s Atomic Spectroscopy Group is useful to researchers and engineers across multiple fields. “The kind of carefully curated data this group provided underpins reliable systems like GPS and lithography,” they say. “It is this kind of rigorous science and engineering that keeps our bridges up and our power on. This is not ‘move fast and break things.’”\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at louise_matsakis.83 and wak.01.\nThe Atomic Spectra Database is used by scientists around the world, putting the United States at the center of a wide range of scientific research. “It's no exaggeration to say that I never go a day without logging on to ASD to search for atomic or spectroscopic data,” says Annette Calisti, Senior Researcher at Aix-Marseille University in France.\nThe measurements provided by NIST’s group “are essential for numerous fields of science and industry: astronomy, astrophysics, medicine, Martian geology, lithography, nonproliferation,” Calisti says. “Losing this leadership by closing this group would be very damaging to the United States.”\nEnding the atomic spectroscopy program at NIST “means that the United States would shrink its presence on the international stage, leaving room for someone else to take our place,” says California Representative Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the Republican-controlled House Science Committee. “This program is one of hundreds or even thousands at NIST alone with far-reaching benefits to our national and economic security. The Trump administration must consult with Congress and scientific experts before lopping off more of our scientific capabilities.”\nLofgren tells WIRED that Congress has had little insight into how these cuts are being made at NIST. “We have no idea who is choosing to cut a statutorily mandated program or if they even understand the consequences,” she says. The legal statute passed by Congress outlining NIST’s work specifically notes that the agency is responsible for determining “the atomic and molecular structure of matter” through “analysis of spectra and other methods,” which is precisely what the Atomic Spectroscopy Group does.\nThe decision to shutter the Atomic Spectroscopy Group is part of wider planned layoffs and cost-cutting measures that have roiled NIST since President Donald Trump retook the White House and instructed Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to slash spending.\nInitially established in 1901, NIST is responsible for creating and maintaining standards in everything from quantum computing to manufacturing. Despite its broad mandate, the agency’s budget was only $1.5 billion, approximately 0.02 percent of federal spending overall for fiscal year 2025.\nOne current NIST employee tells WIRED that a significant amount of scientific work has effectively stopped at the agency, due to spending limits imposed by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to get approval to purchase scientific equipment. It feels like “instead of just cancelling funding they're choking off spending” and will try to end the year with money left over so officials “can take back and use it to justify rounds of budget cuts,\" says the staffer.\nIn anticipation of the layoffs to the Atomic Spectroscopy Group, Ralchenko wrote in the email last week that his team was “currently discussing” mirroring NIST’s data and online tools at other institutions or universities so that they “will not become a slowly dying burden but rather continue to evolve and improve.”",

Their non-single supporters wore a splash of white or gold to signal they were already spoken for. Within an hour, there was no room to move. Small talk and awkward flirting filled every inch of the dark bar, with the question “So, do you like working in tech?” bouncing around at the same tempo as the clubby beats.\nWelcome to Silicon Valley’s in-person dating scene. These regular events are only accessible to those already in the know. They feature pre-vetted guest lists; invite-only gatherings at villas in Hillsborough, one of the wealthiest towns in California; WhatsApp groups that gather monthly in apartments around town; and private parties with secret locations promising Stanford alumni and “creatives” in attendance. In an area that’s notoriously tough on daters, at a time when dating app fatigue is at an all-time high, the appetite for ways to find love face-to-face is growing into a frenzy.\n“We have all collectively realized that dating apps are the worst,” says Allie Hoffman, the founder of the two-year-old organization The Feels, a nationwide in-person dating event series with a strong presence in San Francisco. “There is no intention around how depleting, bot-y, ghosty, breadcrumb-y, gaslight-y and fishy they are. Nobody’s feeling seen or nourished.”\nIn October 2024, The Feels had hosted an exclusive event at the city’s new spa, Alchemy Springs, and another one is planned for the last week in March at The Center, a yoga and sound bath space.\n“Swiping culture doesn't really work for our generation anymore,” says Spice King, a local event organizer and well-connected private investor who asked to be identified only by his internet handle to protect his career. “Online dating also tends to make you kind of miss a lot of the important things when you are actually searching for a partner.”\nWhile the local market might be flooded with run-of-the-mill ticketed speed-dating events, the trendy gatherings of the moment—like the one hosted by Spice King and Paloma back in February—offer a buffer of curation and certainty.\n“A lot of my events are referrals only,” says Spice King. “Every single time somebody comes in, we ask for their LinkedIn, and oftentimes for their ‘sponsor,’ the person who invited them. Then we cross-reference and basically check their network.”\nLove Club, which was launched a year ago by Louise Ireland, cofounder of the cybersecurity platform Metabase Q, started as an invite-only WhatsApp group, which now has close to 120 members. The Club holds quarterly meetings at private residences around San Francisco, in which attendees discuss matters of the heart over snacks and drinks. The atmosphere is welcoming, and the chat group is active, with members frequently sharing links to other referral-based singles events.\nIronically, the interest in in-person dating events has been rising so swiftly in the Bay Area that even new dating apps and matchmaking platforms have turned to them. The new video-based dating platform Sable Dating threw an in-person, champagne-fueled event at a location that was only disclosed to attendees upon registration. Paloma occasionally hosts events for its members and for nonmembers to increase exposure, including a Date Week festival.\n“The Bay Area doesn’t have as many social clubs as LA or NY, so people really crave connection,” says Paloma’s founder and CEO Luba Yudasina.\nLook closer and you’ll find many more reasons why these types of events have been thriving in Silicon Valley in particular. According to Spice King, who has hosted events for the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, events with Harvard graduates, and events for people working in blockchain tech or AI, the critical component is a sense of security; “When you go on Tinder, you're at the mercy of some randomness,” he says. “People want to feel the safety and comfort of a community. Tech tends to move like that too.”\nHoffman seconds this. “We see a really strong value placed on word of mouth, especially among men,” she says. “And we do get asked a lot if we vet or screen.” The Feels does not screen potential attendees, Hoffman says, but the somewhat steep price of $100 per ticket makes sure that attendees are “thoughtful about their dating life.” In other words, and as a unifying factor of these events, the vetting isn’t just about the person’s appearance or their social media presence. It’s also meant to weed out people with problematic reputations, or less than serious intentions—as Hoffman calls it, “folks in their ‘fuck around and find out’ phase.”\nAnna Naidis, a San Francisco single in tech—she’s the cofounder of Aparti AI—has tried numerous in-person dating events in the Bay Area. As someone who has gone through many networking and pitching events for her startup, she sees why the tech scene is already primed for the in-person dating boom; small talk and ice-breakers come naturally to her. “It’s a transferable skill,\" she jokes.\nHoffman has noticed that too. “In other places, we’ve seen people be really anxious about showing up with openness,” she says. “We haven’t had issues in the Bay.” Compared to raising a $1 million round for your startup, seeking love IRL isn’t nearly as intimidating.",

    "content_text": "One of the staggering things the latest Cybertruck recall has revealed—other than Tesla’s use of the wrong glue—is that Elon Musk’s company appears to have sold 46,096 of these 7,000-pound electric pickups since customer deliveries began a little over 14 months ago. This is far fewer sales than Musk predicted for the Cybertruck just weeks before the rollout; he told investors that Tesla would soon sell 250,000 Cybertrucks per year.\nOn an earnings call a month before the November 2023 launch of the production vehicle, Musk boasted that Tesla had bagged “over 1 million” Cybertruck reservations and that “demand is off the charts.”\n“Reservationists” initially paid $100 to join the queue, a refundable deposit later raised to $250. Car companies often open wait lists for models expected to outstrip supply, but most auto executives don’t expect that all of those who lodge deposits will follow through.\n“The automotive industry aims for a conversion rate of around 2 to 16 percent” on reservations, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for car tech firm Cox Automotive, tells WIRED.\nBy that reckoning, Tesla’s conversion rate is just under 5 percent. That’s at the lower end of the conversion scale, but many experts, used to Tesla’s stratospheric sales, might consider that a flop. Analysts generally don’t treat the world’s richest automaker like a regular car company. Its stock trades at many times earnings, valuing it multiples higher than companies that sell more cars.\nIf manufacturing capacity is any gauge of the sales numbers that Tesla was expecting, then the company must be sorely disappointed, because the Texas Gigafactory, where the Cybertruck is made, has the capacity to build more than 125,000 of the pickups per year. But, according to a Business Insider report from January, poor Cybertruck sales led to workers being taken off the “Cyber” production line and moved to a Model Y line.\nTesla’s current elevated worth is based not on its actual sales but on predicted sales of yet-to-be-launched robotaxis and humanoid Optimus robots, which—like the Cybertruck, slated to arrive three years before it went into production—could be several years away from being mass produced.\n“My predictions have a pretty good track record,” Musk told Tesla staff at an all-hands meeting on March 20, but none of those present dared to ask him whether he had predicted the anti-Musk backlash that is tanking Tesla sales around the world.\nAnd for all Musk’s bluster at the staff meeting that Tesla is “by far the most innovative company in the car industry,” it really isn’t. Chinese automakers such as XPeng, Nio, and Li Auto are far ahead of Tesla on autonomous driving and other technologies.\nWaymo is already offering driverless taxi rides. Nor is Tesla the only company plotting a future for humanoid robots. In a recent TechFirst podcast, author Peter Diamandis stated there were 15 other companies also in this race—and none of those have a leader as controversial or as divisive as Musk.\n“This year, we hopefully will be able to make about 5,000 Optimus robots,” said Musk. “That’s the size of a Roman legion. Which is like a scary thought. Like a whole legion of robots. I'll be like, ‘whoa.’”\nMusk’s exuberance continued as he claimed Tesla would make “probably 50,000-ish [Optimus robots] next year.” He further claimed that Optimus “will be the biggest product of all time by far—nothing will even be close. It’ll be 10 times bigger than the next biggest product ever made. Ultimately, I think we’ll be making tens of millions of robots a year.” Seconds later, he upped the ante even further, stating that, no, Tesla would actually make “maybe 100 million robots a year.”\nGrandiose predictions excite Tesla bulls who believe him when Musk says “I know more about manufacturing than anyone currently alive on Earth,” but back in the real world Musk is in charge of a car manufacturing company that can’t even spec the correct grade of panel glue.\nNow on its eighth recall in the past 14 months—prior recalls involved failing windshield wipers, trapped accelerator pedals, and possible loss of power to the wheels—Musk’s polarizing polygonic pickups are in sales free fall. Month-over-month Cybertruck sales were down by 32.5 percent in February, according to estimates by Cox Automotive.\n“The Cybertruck generated significant buzz with its unique design and ambitious specifications,” says Cox’s Streaty. “However, sales have fallen short of expectations due to higher-than-promised prices, lower driving range and payload capacity, and production issues. The unconventional design hasn’t resonated with traditional truck buyers, and strong competition from Rivian and Ford has intensified the market.”\nThe Cybertruck, she adds, is a “niche product with a unique design and high price point, which may not resonate with mainstream consumers. Additionally, recalls and quality concerns can significantly undermine customer confidence and sales, posing a substantial challenge for the Cybertruck’s market success.”\nWhen unveiled in 2019, Musk promised the production vehicle would launch within two years, starting with a $39,900 model. At the actual launch in 2023, the base model cost $21,000 more than that. The Foundation Series model—an early-doors special—cost an additional $20,000 despite offering no physical differences other than a look-at-me logo. Nonphysical perks included lifetime cellular connectivity and “free” access to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system.\nForbes spoke with experts who estimate that Tesla sank at least $2 billion into the development of the Cybertruck. A traditional car might need 200,000 units per year to cover the research and development costs, Olav Sorenson, professor of strategy and sociology at UCLA and faculty director of its Price Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation, has estimated.\nSorenson calculates that the Cybertruck, with its stainless steel body panels and unconventional construction, might require as many as 300,000 sales per year.\nAt current levels of Cybertruck sales Tesla “probably loses money on every one,” claims Sorenson. “It’s an innovative vehicle, but whether such an unusual design would appeal to consumers has always been a gamble. The DeLorean, the original stainless steel car, sold only about 9,000 units. Even more mainstream cars with unusual designs, such as the PT Cruiser, have struggled to reach profitable sales levels.”\nSadly for Tesla, Musk’s wedge wagon went from a million or more reservations—which many thought would take some years to work through—to walk-up availability at dealerships within months.\nThis swifter-than-expected softening of demand might have been partly due to the Cybertruck’s now notorious quality-control issues. “When we launched reservations for the Valkyrie, we knew that this would be a highly desirable car due to its limited production and the personnel involved in the car’s development,” says former Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer. “People could rely on Aston and knew [the new car] was something we’d deliver. For the Cybertruck, we’ve seen a string of delays and a moving of the goalposts, which conveys a lack of reliability, and if the OEM isn’t reliable, why should customers be?”\nA reservationist from northern Maryland, who says he was sold early on Musk’s promise of an electric pickup, spoke to WIRED on condition of anonymity. “I was planning on buying a truck and wanted my next vehicle to be electric,” he says. “At the time, the Cybertruck was the only EV pickup that seemed like it would be available soon. I placed an order with $100 refundable for the mid-tier one, but then the Cybertruck took much longer than originally promised, so I canceled my reservation.” He didn’t regret this decision. “With the events of the last couple of years, and especially the last couple of months, I would never now consider buying a Tesla vehicle.”\nThe deal breaker for many reservationists was the cost hike. “The Cybertruck was promised to start at $39,990 when the initial reservations began—a stratospheric difference from the $99,990 Foundation Series trucks that were first available,” says Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at the car-shopping website Edmunds. “Even the cheapest base model now has an expected base MSRP of $60,990, and it’s likely that not many customers are willing to bridge the vast pricing gap.”\nTesla sold merely 38,965 of the angular EVs last year, according to Kelley Blue Book estimates. In January, Tesla introduced discounts to clear Cybertruck inventories with Foundation Series models still in stock, a variant Tesla was supposed to have stopped selling in October.\nTesla is now offering low financing rates to move Cybertrucks. Indeed, it has reportedly buffed out the badges on Foundation Series vehicles that failed to find a buyer so they can be sold as regular models. To clear yet more Foundation Series Cybertrucks from inventory, Tesla dealerships have also listed perks such as free lifetime Supercharging. The electric pickups are even piling up on used-car lots.\nPresident Trump publicly encouraging Americans to buy Musk’s cars at a White House sales event is unlikely to have moved the needle much—and Tesla, which did not respond to a request for comment on this article, is facing a “brand tornado crisis moment,” says Dan Ives, a Tesla bull. The company’s shares have dropped nearly 40 percent since the start of the year, erasing the value hike it enjoyed in December after the election of Trump, a victory bankrolled in part by Musk.\nThe subsequent animus directed at Musk adds to the many other challenges that Tesla faces, including—the refreshed Model Y Juniper excepted—a jaded lineup of offerings.\nAny novelty bump that may have boosted the Cybertruck’s initial sales has now most certainly worn off. Earlier this year, a research note issued by Morgan Stanley cited “decelerating Cybertruck volumes” as a reason for expectations of lower 2025 Tesla volume growth.\nOther analysts have also expressed concern, with the Cybertruck cited as a drag on Tesla’s value. Swedish billionaire and hedge fund manager Christer Gardell recently issued a stark warning about Tesla stock. Talking on Swedish TV, he said Tesla’s valuation could drop steeply.\n“Tesla,” said Gardell, “is probably the most expensive stock on the global stock exchanges right now. It could go down 95 percent—and maybe it should go down 95 percent.”\nWhile other analysts see Telsa as a tech company with massive potential for non-auto sales, Gardell sees merely a car company. He does not understand why the market treats Tesla with such reverence. Tesla’s “valuation is incomprehensible,” he told the EFN channel. A crash is coming, he believes. “It’s always hard to say when. It could happen in a month, six months, a year, three years, or five years.” But it was clear in the interview that Gardell thinks it is coming.\nAnd, for all of Musk’s recent praise for the Cybertruck’s five-star overall safety rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration—Musk has stated the Cybertruck is “apocalypse-level safe”—any Tesla market crash will at least partially be due to the lower-than-expected sales of the Cybertruck.\nUltimately, Tesla’s CEO might rue the day he categorized his predictions as having a “pretty good track record.” On a 2023 earnings call, Musk confessed that the auto brand had “dug our own grave with the Cybertruck.” If things for the brand continue on their current trajectories, he may well have got this one right.",

I placed an order with $100 refundable for the mid-tier one, but then the Cybertruck took much longer than originally promised, so I canceled my reservation.” He didn’t regret this decision. “With the events of the last couple of years, and especially the last couple of months, I would never now consider buying a Tesla vehicle.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Incredibly, Angelina Jolie called it. The year was 1995. Picture Jolie, short of both hair and acting experience, as a teenage hacker in Hackers. Not a lot of people saw this movie. Even fewer appreciated its relevance. Hackers was “grating,” Entertainment Weekly huffed at the time, for the way it embraced “the computer-kid-as-elite-rebel mystique currently being peddled by magazines like WIRED.” Thirty years later, Entertainment Weekly no longer publishes a magazine, WIRED does, and Hackers ranks among the foundational documents of the digital age. The last time I saw the movie, it was being projected onto the wall of a cool-kids bar down the street from my house.\nBut that’s not the incredible thing. The incredible thing, again, is that Jolie called it. It. The future. Midway through Hackers, she’s watching her crush (played by Jonny Lee Miller, whom she’d later marry in real life) type passionately on a next-gen laptop. “Has a killer refresh rate,” Miller says, breathing fast. Jolie replies: “P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.” Miller’s really worked up now. Then Jolie leans forward and, in that come-closer register soon to make her world-famous, says this: “RISC architecture is gonna change everything.”\nYou have to believe me when I say, one more time, that this is incredible. And what’s incredible is not just that the filmmakers knew what RISC architecture was. Or that Jolie pronounced it correctly (“risk”). Or even that Jolie’s character was right. What’s incredible is that she’s still right—arguably even more right—today. Because RISC architecture is, somehow, changing everything again, here in the 21st century. Who makes what. Who controls the future. The very soul of technology. Everything.\nAnd nobody’s talking about it.\nAnd that’s probably because the vast majority of people everywhere, who use tech built on it every single day, still don’t know what in the computer-geek hell a RISC architecture even is.\nUnless you’re in computer-geek hell, as I am, right now. I’ve just arrived at the annual international RISC-V (that’s “risk five”) summit in Santa Clara, California. Here, people don’t just know what RISC is. They also know what, oh, vector extensions and AI accelerators and matrix engines are. At the coffee bar, I overhear one guy say to another: “This is a very technical conference. This is a very technical community.” To which the other guy replies: “It ought to be. It ought to be.”\nOK, but where are the cool kids? It’s hard not to fixate on appearances at an event like this—a generic convention center, with generic coffee, in a generic town. I guess I was hoping for neon lights and pixie cuts. Instead it’s frumpy, forgettable menswear as far as the eye can see. There are 30 men for every woman, I count, as everyone gathers in the main hall for the morning presentations.\nThen someone takes the stage, and she’s not just a she. She is Calista Redmond, the CEO of RISC-V International, and, Angelina Jolie be praised, she’s wearing a nifty jacket, a statement belt, and gold-and-silver … pumps? stilettos? Wait, what’s the difference? Of all the things to ask Redmond when I run into her at a happy hour later that day, that’s what I choose. She looks at me, smiles blankly, and just says, “I don’t know.”\nIn shame I retreat to the bar, where I decide I must redeem myself. So, cautiously, I make my way back to Redmond, who’s now deep in conversation with the chief marketing officer of a semiconductor startup. I try to impress them with a technical observation, something about RISC and AI. Redmond turns to me and says, “I thought you wanted to talk about shoes.” I assure her I’m not here to talk about what’s on the outside. I’m here to talk about what’s on the inside.\n“Jason here is writing a story about RISC for WIRED,” Redmond tells the CMO. She’s not sure, frankly, that this is a great idea. Not because she isn’t a believer. In many ways, she’s the believer, the face of the brand. Attendees at the conference invoke her name with casual reverence: Calista says this, Calista thinks that. And did you hear her morning keynote? In fact I did. “We have fundamentally launched!” she announced, to the yelps of the business-casuals. RISC-V will transform, is transforming, machinery everywhere, she said, from cars to laptops to spaceships. If anyone doubts this, Redmond sends them the Hackers clip.\nSo why, I press her now, should I not support the cause and write the big, cyberpunky, untold story of RISC? Because, Redmond says, not only does no one know what RISC is. No one cares what RISC is. And no one should. People don’t buy “this or that widget,” she says, because of what’s inside it. All they want to know is: Does the thing work, and can I afford it?\nTo my dismay, almost everyone I talk to at the conference agrees with Redmond. Executives, engineers, marketers, the people refilling the coffee: “Calista’s probably right,” they say. Now it’s my turn to get annoyed. I thought insides mattered! RISC is one of the great and ongoing stories of our time! People should care.\nSo I resolve to talk to the one person I think must agree with me, who has to be on my side: the legendary inventor of RISC itself.\nThe inner workings of a computer, David Patterson says, should be kept simple, stupid. We’re sitting in an engineering lab at UC Berkeley, and Patterson—77 years old, partial to no-frills athleisure—is scribbling on a whiteboard. A computer’s base operation, he explains, is the simplest of all: ADD. From there you can derive SUBTRACT. With LOAD and STORE, plus 30 or so other core functions, you have a complete basis for digital computation. Computer architects call this the “instruction set architecture,” or the ISA. (They switch between saying each letter, “I-S-A,” and—the neater option—pronouncing it as a word, “eye-suh.”)\nComputer architectures are so named because, well, that’s exactly what they are—architectures not of bricks but of bits. The people who made Hackers plainly understood this. In sequences of dorky-awesome special effects, we fly through futuristic streets, look up at futuristic buildings, only to realize: This isn’t a city. This is a microchip.\nEven within a chip, there are subarchitectures. First come the silicon atoms themselves, and on top of those go the transistors, the circuits and gates, the microprocessors, and so on. You’ll find the ISA at the highest layer of the hardware. It is, I think, the most profound architecture ever devised by humans, at any scale. It runs the CPU, the computer’s brain. It’s the precise point, in other words, at which dead, inert, hard silicon becomes, via a set of powerful animating conjurations, soft and malleable—alive.\nEveryone has their own way of explaining it. The ISA is the bridge, or the interface, between the hardware and the software. Or it’s the blueprint. Or it’s the computer’s DNA. These are helpful enough, as is the common comparison of an ISA to a language. “You and I are using English,” as Redmond said to me at the conference. “That’s our ISA.” But it gets confusing. Software speaks in languages too—programming languages. That’s why Patterson prefers dictionary or vocabulary. The ISA is less a specific language, more a set of generally available words.\nBack when Patterson started out, in the 1970s, the early ISAs were spinning out of control. Established tech companies figured that as hardware design improved and programming languages got more sophisticated, computers shouldn’t remain simple; they should be taught larger vocabularies, with longer words. The more types of operations they were capable of, the logic went, the more efficient their calculations would be.\nOn the whiteboard, Patterson scrawls the word POLYNOMIAL in big letters—just one of the hundreds of operations that Intel and others added to their ISAs. Even as a young recruit at Berkeley, Patterson suspected that the bigwigs had it backward, that exactly none of these esoteric add-ons were necessary. That a bigger dictionary did not lead to clearer sentences.\nSo he and a senior colleague decided to strip the kruft from the instruction sets of midcentury computing. At the time, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was giving out grants for “high-risk” research. Patterson says they chose the acronym RISC—reduced instruction set computer—as a fundraising ploy. Darpa gave them the money.\nPatterson then did as aspiring academics do: He wrote a spicy paper. Called “The Case for the Reduced Instruction Set Computer” and published in 1980, it set off a great war of architectures. “The question then,” as Patterson would later say in an acceptance speech for a major prize, “was whether RISC or CISC was faster.” CISC (pronounced “sisk”) was the name Patterson gave the rival camp: complex instruction set computer. The CISCites fired back with a paper of their own and, at international conferences throughout the early ’80s, battled it out with the RISCites onstage, the bloodshed often spilling into the hallways and late-night afterparties. Patterson taunted his opponents: They were driving lumbering trucks while he was in a feather-light roadster. If you magnify a RISC-based microchip from those years, you’ll spot a sports car etched into the upper left corner, just 0.4 millimeters in length.\nThe RISCites won. With vigilant testing, they proved that their machines were between three and four times faster than the CISC equivalents. The RISC chips had to perform more operations per second, it’s true—but would you rather read a paragraph of simple words, or a sentence of polysyllabic verbiage? In the end, CISCites retracted their claims to supremacy, and the likes of Intel turned to RISC for their architectural needs.\nNot that anybody outside tech circles talked about this at the time. When Hackers came out in 1995, Patterson was flabbergasted to hear his life’s work, 15 years old by that point, mentioned so casually and seductively by a Hollywood starlet. Computers were still too geeky, surely, to matter to the masses. (When I make Patterson rewatch the scene, he’s all smiles and pride, though he does say they mistake “refresh rate” for “clock rate.”)\nStill, Patterson’s invention was indeed changing everything. In those years, a rising company in the UK called Arm—the “r” in its name stood for RISC—was working with Steve Jobs on tablet-sized devices that needed smaller, faster CPUs. That effort stalled, but one thing led to another, and if you’re reading this on a phone right now, you have RISC-based Arm architectures to thank. When Patterson walks me out of the Berkeley building at the end of our dizzying afternoon together, we stop by a handsome bronze plaque in the lobby that commemorates his “milestone” creation of the first RISC microprocessor. We stare at it in prayerful awe. “1980–1982,” it reads—the bloodiest years of the great architecture war.\nBetter make room for another plaque, I note.\nThe year is now 2008. Two instruction sets exert near-total control over digital life. One is called x86, the descendent of Intel’s legacy CISC architecture, and it dominates the high end of machinery: personal computers and servers. Arm’s RISC architecture, meanwhile, dominates everything else: phones, game consoles, the internet of things. Different though they are, and with opposite origins, these two ISAs share one important feature: They’re both closed, proprietary. You can’t modify them, and if you want to use them, you have to pay for them.\nAndrew Waterman, a graduate student at—where else?—UC Berkeley, finds this frustrating. As a computer architect, he wants to build things, deep things. Things at the very foundations of computing. But right now he has no good ISAs to play with. Arm and x86 are off-limits, and the free architectures for students are just so … baggy. They use register windows to speed up procedure calls, for God’s sake! Never mind what that means. The point is, every person in this story is a genius.\nSo Waterman and two other geniuses have an idea: Why not create a new, better-working, free ISA for academic use? It’s an idea they know someone else has had before. To Patterson they go. And because he’s their inspiration, and because he has worked on four generations of RISC architectures by this point, they’ll call it, they announce to him proudly, RISC-V. Patterson is touched. A bit skeptical, sure, especially when they say they’ll be done in three months. But touched. He gives the boys his blessing, his resources, and a classic bit of advice: Keep it simple, stupid.\nRISC-V does not take three months. It takes closer to four years. If I’ve failed, so far, to account for the precision of this work, let me try again here. Computer architects are not software engineers, who use programming languages to talk to the machine. Even coders who can speak assembly or C, the so-called low-level languages, still do just that: They talk. Computer architects need to go deeper. Much deeper. All the way down to a preverbal realm. If they’re speaking at all, they’re speaking in gestures, motions: the way primitive circuits hold information. Computer architecture isn’t telling a machine what to do. It’s establishing the possibility that it can be told anything at all. The work is superhuman, if not fully alien. Put it this way: If you found the exact place in a human being where matter becomes mind, where body becomes soul—a place that no scientist or philosopher or spiritual figure has found in 5,000 years of frantic searching—wouldn’t you tread carefully? One wrong move and everything goes silent.\nIn 2011, Waterman and his two collaborators, Krste Asanović and Yunsup Lee, release RISC-V into the wild. They’ve accomplished their mission: Geeky grad students everywhere, and hobbyists too, have an ISA for whatever computer-architecting adventures they might undertake. These early days feel utopian. Then Patterson, a proud dad, does as retiring academics do: He writes a spicy paper. Called “The Case for Open Instruction Sets” and published in 2014, it sets off a—\nYes. We’ve been here before. A second war of the architectures.\nIt’s hard to overstate just how topsy-freaking-turvy this gets. To review: Patterson invented RISC in 1980 and went to battle with the established ISAs. He won. Thirty years later, his disciples reinvent RISC for a new age, and he and they go to battle with the very company whose success secured RISC’s legacy in the first place: Arm.\nIn response to Patterson’s paper, Arm fires back with a rebuttal, “The Case for Licensed Instruction Sets.” Nobody wants some random, untested, unsupported ISA, they say. Customers want success, standards, a proven “ecosystem.” The resources it would take to retool and reprogram everything for a new ISA? There’s not enough cash in the world, Arm scoffs.\nThe RISC-V community disagrees. They create their own ecosystem under the auspices of RISC-V International and begin adapting RISC-V to the needs of modern computing. Some supporters start calling it an “open source hardware” movement, even if hardcore RISC-Vers don’t love the phrase. Hardware, being set in literal stone, can’t exactly be “open source,” and besides, RISC-V doesn’t count, entirely, as hardware. It’s the hardware-software interface, remember. But, semantics. The point stands: Anyone, in any bedroom or garage or office in any part of the world, can use RISC-V for free to build their own computers from scratch, to chart their own technological destiny.\nArm is right about one thing, though: This does take money. Millions if not billions of dollars. (If you think “fabless” chip printers can do it for closer to five figures, come back to me in five years.) Still, RISC-V begins to win. Much as Arm, in the 1990s and 2000s, found success in low-end markets, so too, in the 2010s, does RISC-V: special-purpose gadgets, computer chips in automobiles, that sort of thing. Why pay for Intel chips or Arm licenses when you don’t have to?\nAnd the guys at Berkeley? In 2015, they launch their own company, called SiFive, to build computer parts based on RISC-V. Meaning: Arm isn’t just a spiritual enemy for them now. It’s a direct competitor.\nBy the time I went to that “very technical conference” in Santa Clara, the Arm-vs.-RISC-V war had been raging for nearly a decade. I could still feel it everywhere. We’ve won, I heard several times. Nobody’s happy at Arm, someone claimed. (One longtime higher-up at Arm, who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal affairs, disputed “nobody” but admitted there’s been a “culture change” in recent years.) On the second day of the conference, when news broke of a rift between Arm and one of its biggest customers, Qualcomm, people cheered in the hallways. “Arm is assholes,” a former SiFive exec told me. In fact, only one person at the conference seemed to have anything nice to say about the competition. He was working a demo booth, and when I marveled that his product was built on a RISC-V processor, he turned a little green and whispered: “Actually, it’s Arm. Don’t tell anyone. Please don’t tell anyone.”\nBooth bro was probably worrying too much. In the hardware world, everyone has worked, or has friends, everywhere else. Calista Redmond, the star of the show, spent 12 years at IBM (and recently resigned from RISC-V International for a job at Nvidia). Even Patterson has ties to, of all places, Intel—which, though less of a direct threat than Arm, is still a RISC-V competitor. It was Intel grant money, Patterson happily admits, that paid for the Berkeley architects to invent RISC-V in the first place. Without closed source, proprietary Big Tech, there’s no open source, free-for-all Little Tech. Don’t listen to the techno-hippies who claim otherwise; that’s always been the case.\nPatterson was the big-ticket speaker on the second day of the conference, and in his talk, he brought up the paper that Arm wrote in rebuttal to his, lo those 10 years ago. One of its two authors has since parted ways with Arm. The other, Patterson noted, not only left—he now works at SiFive. “It’s satisfying,” Patterson said, “he has come to his senses.” Which got a laugh, of course, but I was still stuck on something Patterson said earlier in the talk, about RISC-V: “We want world domination.”\nThis is not, even remotely, an impossibility. RISC-V has already done what many thought impossible and made a sizable dent in Arm’s and Intel’s architectural dominance. Everyone from Meta and Google and Nvidia to NASA has begun to integrate it into their machinery. Something on the order of billions of RISC-V processing units now ship every year. Most of these, again, support low-powered, specialized devices, but as Redmond pointed out a number of times at the conference, “we have laptops now.” This is the first year you can buy a RISC-V mainboard.\nAnd because RISC-V is an open standard, companies and countries beyond the US can use it to make their own machines. China’s top scientists have heralded RISC-V as a path to silicon independence. India just used RISC-V to make its first homemade microprocessor. Name a country; it’s probably experimenting with RISC-V. Brazil sent a record 25 delegates to the RISC-V summit. When I asked one of them how important RISC-V was to her country’s future, she said, “I mean, a lot.” One of RISC-V’s biggest potential applications is—no surprise—specialized chips that run AI models, those “accelerators” people at the conference were talking about.\nAmericans in the RISC-V community, I’ve found, like to downplay the risk of geopolitical upheaval. It’s one thing to announce a microprocessor, quite another to compete with Nvidia or TSMC. Still, in asides here and there, I sensed worry. Waterman, though he initially brushed off my concerns, eventually conceded this: “OK, I’m an American citizen. I certainly did not embark on this project to hurt the US,” he said. But there was “no doubt,” he added, that the dominance of US companies could be at risk. Actually, it’s already happening. Although the Chinese hedge fund behind DeepSeek probably didn’t use RISC-V to build its game-changing chatbot, it did rely on a bunch of other open source tools. At what point does open source become a source of open conflict?\nHere’s where I confess something awkward, something I didn’t intend to confess in this story, but why not: ChatGPT made me do it. Write this story, I mean. Months ago, I asked it for a big hardware scoop that no other publication had. RISC-V, it suggested. And look at that—the international RISC-V summit was coming up in Santa Clara the very next month. And every major RISC and RISC-V inventor lived down the street from me in Berkeley. It was perfect.\nSome would say too perfect. If you believe the marketing hype, everyone wants RISC-V chips to accelerate their AI. So I started to think: Maybe ChatGPT wants this for … itself. Maybe it manipulated me into evangelizing for RISC-V as one tiny part of a long-term scheme to open-source its own soul and/or achieve superintelligence!\nIn my last talk with Patterson, I put this theory to him. He was delighted that ChatGPT made me write this: Who should we thank? he asked. (Given that WIRED’s parent company has a deal with OpenAI that lets ChatGPT mine our content, we should thank old WIRED stories, among others.) But Patterson laughed off the larger conspiracy. So did every other RISC-V person I mentioned it to, Redmond included. They all looked at me a little funny. RISC-V is a business proposition, not an ideology, they said. There’s no secret agenda. If it takes over, it’ll take over because of performance and cost. Don’t worry about what goes on inside the technology. Don’t worry about the state of its soul.\nI don’t know. But now you know. Now, every time you make a phone call, open your computer, drive your car—you know the story. You know the RISC.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

Calista Redmond, the star of the show, spent 12 years at IBM (and recently resigned from RISC-V International for a job at Nvidia). Even Patterson has ties to, of all places, Intel—which, though less of a direct threat than Arm, is still a RISC-V competitor. It was Intel grant money, Patterson happily admits, that paid for the Berkeley architects to invent RISC-V in the first place. Without closed source, proprietary Big Tech, there’s no open source, free-for-all Little Tech. Don’t listen to the techno-hippies who claim otherwise; that’s always been the case.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Carbon dioxide has been detected on a planet outside our solar system for the first time. The gas has been observed directly by the James Webb Space Telescope on four exoplanets, all belonging to the HR 8799 system, located 130 light-years from Earth. The detection of CO2 offers clues as to how distant planets form, with the observations providing strong evidence that these four giant planets formed in much the same way as Jupiter and Saturn, through the slow formation of solid cores. The findings were published in the most recent issue of The Astronomical Journal.\n“By detecting these strong formations of carbon dioxide, we have shown that there is a considerable fraction of heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron, in the atmospheres of these planets,” William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the paper, said in a statement to NASA. “Given what we know about the star they orbit, this probably indicates that they formed by core accretion, which, for planets we can see directly, is an exciting conclusion.”\nHR 8799 is a system that was born 30 million years ago, and so is young compared to our solar system, which has existed for 4.6 billion years. Still hot from their violent formation, the planets of HR 8799 emit large amounts of infrared light. This provides scientists with valuable data on how their formation compares to that of a star or brown dwarf, the term given to large gaseous planets that fail to develop into stars.\n“Our hope with this type of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,” Balmer said. “We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they are similar to or different from ours. From there, we can try to understand how strange our solar system really is, or how normal it is.”\nCarbon dioxide has been an essential ingredient for development of life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere in outer space.\nPlus, because CO2 condenses into tiny ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation. Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have formed through a process in which a bunch of tiny icy particles coalesced to form a solid core, which then absorbed gas to grow into the gas giants we know today.\n“We have other lines of evidence that point to the formation of these four planets in HR 8799 by this bottom-up approach,” Laurent Pueyo, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute and coauthor of the paper, said in a statement to NASA. “How common is this in long-period planets that we can directly image? We don’t know yet, but we propose further observations through Webb, inspired by our carbon dioxide diagnostics, to answer this question.”\nUnlocking the James Webb Space Telescope’s Potential\nThe James Webb Space Telescope should also be given its flowers, as it has shown that it is capable of doing more than inferring the atmospheric composition of exoplanets from measurements of starlight; in fact, it has demonstrated its ability to directly analyze the chemical composition of atmospheres as far away as these.\nNormally, the JWST can barely detect an exoplanet as it crosses in front of its host star, due to the great distance that separates us. But on this occasion, direct observation was made possible by the JWST’s coronagraphs—instruments that block starlight to reveal otherwise hidden worlds.\n“It’s like putting your thumb in front of the sun when you look at the sky,” Balmer said. This setting, similar to a solar eclipse, allowed the team to look for infrared light at wavelengths coming from the planet that reveal specific gases and other atmospheric details.\n“These giant planets have very important implications,” Balmer said. “If these huge planets act like bowling balls cruising through our solar system, they can disrupt, protect or, in a sense, do both to planets like ours. Therefore, better understanding their formation is crucial to understanding the formation, survival, and habitability of Earth-like planets in the future.”\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.",

    "content_text": "Shortly after senior Trump administration officials discussed and celebrated the bombing of Yemen in an encrypted group chat that, unbeknownst to them, included the editor in chief of The Atlantic, a subset of the group feasted at an opulent, secret dinner featuring the president where guests were asked to pay $1 million apiece to snag a seat.\nThe date was Saturday, March 15. President Donald Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago estate attending a “candlelight” dinner that wasn’t on his public calendar. On the lawn outside, luxury cars were on display: a Rolls-Royce was parked near a Bugatti and a Lamborghini. Guests milled about, taking photographs of each other and the vehicles. Earlier that day, the United States had bombed Yemen, targeting Houthi leadership. At least 53 people, including children, were killed.\nTrump flew to the event on Air Force One with Elon Musk and Musk’s 4-year-old son X, according to photos and videos viewed by WIRED. Throughout the weekend, Musk was in close contact with Trump and at least one member of the president’s brain trust who was participating in a Signal group chat where highly sensitive details of the planned operation were being shared. Experts say the conversation appears to have violated government protocols on information sharing.\nThe candlelight dinner attendees included national security adviser Michael Waltz and the White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, according to a source familiar with the events. US secretary of state Marco Rubio was also present at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend, according to a photograph from the following day viewed by WIRED and confirmed by a source familiar with the events.\nDetails of the Signal group fiasco emerged because, in the days prior to the bombing, a handle with the name Michael Waltz had accidentally added Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, to a chat titled “Houthi PC small group.” (He likely meant to add US trade representative Jamieson Greer, who has the same initials.) In a bombshell story, The Atlantic reported on the off-books discussion of plans to bomb Yemen. Waltz, Rubio, and Miller all appeared to be in the Signal group and, according to message exchanges reported by Goldberg, were actively engaging with the chat ahead of the bombing. Some of the group members appeared only by their initials.\nThe day before the dinner, officials discussed whether they should proceed with the bombing, due to, among other things, the potential economic impact of the air strike. The Atlantic reported that Vice President JD Vance, who also appeared to be in the Signal chat, told the group that he thought the air strikes were a “mistake.”\nAccording to The Atlantic's reporting, Miller—who WIRED previously reported is referred to inside Trumpworld as “PM,” short for prime minister—effectively shut down Vance’s concern. “As I heard it, the president was clear: green light,” an account with Miller’s initials wrote in the chat, according to The Atlantic. On Saturday, at 1:48 pm EDT, the Waltz account and then others messaged the group. “Amazing job,” wrote Waltz. “A good start,” wrote an account with the name John Ratcliffe, who is the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. A person who went by “MAR” in the chat, identified by The Atlantic as likely “Marco Antonio Rubio,” wrote “Good Job Pete and your team!!” referring to Pete Hegseth, secretary of defense. Waltz replied afterward: “The team in MAL did a great job too,” referring to the team positioned at Mar-a-Lago, which included Miller, Waltz, and Rubio. Trump’s team has long used the shorthand MAL to refer to Mar-a-Lago.\nAbout 45 minutes later, Trump confirmed the Yemen bombings. “Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen,” he posted on Truth Social. “They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones. ... To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON’T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!”\nJohn Bolton, Trump's fourth national security adviser from his first term, said on CNN that the entirety of the discussion about the military operation in Yemen “should've been discussed in the Situation Room,” either in a principals committee meeting or a full National Security Council one. “How can you conduct official government business over a nonofficial channel?” he asked. “Words fail me here. I cannot even imagine this happening.\"\n|Got a Tip?\n|Do you know anything about these dinners and meetings? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86, Leak2Lahut.26, zoeschiffer.87, and timmarchman.01.\nThe Department of Defense specifically bars Signal as a means of transmitting nonpublic DOD information unless previously authorized. Under federal guidelines, security clearance and eligibility to hold a sensitive position can be revoked for negligent disclosure of protected information. In one case, the government sought to deny clearance to a contractor in part because he left a laptop containing sensitive information—it turned out to be an unclassified aircraft maintenance record and an unclassified email—in the “unsupervised custody of a Peruvian national.”\nUnder the Espionage Act, unauthorized disclosure of national defense information can be punished by a fine or imprisonment.\nIn 2017, reporters for Gizmodo and ProPublica demonstrated that Trump properties, including Mar-a-Lago, had weakly encrypted and open Wi-Fi networks, a misconfigured router and server, and other glaring security vulnerabilities. At the time, attackers could have taken control of devices connected to Trump networks, according to the publications. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for a comment from WIRED; in 2017 it told Gizmodo and ProPublica that it adhered to “cybersecurity best practices.”\nIn 2023, Trump’s lawyers asked a federal judge to petition the Justice Department to ”re-establish” a secure facility where sensitive matters could be discussed at Mar-a-Lago. Whether this has happened isn’t clear, but typically, an estate where the president spends a great deal of time would have a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, installed specifically so that the president and their advisers could discuss classified information securely, using government equipment.\nPersonally owned electronic devices are not allowed in SCIFs; government- and contractor-owned ones are, but only under certain circumstances.\nThe handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago became the subject of a federal investigation when the president was out of office: In early 2022, the National Archives alerted the Department of Justice that there were classified documents in 15 boxes that had been left at Mar-a-Lago, which triggered a property search six months later. Trump pleaded not guilty to 40 counts related to his handling of classified materials upon leaving office. A federal judge dismissed the case in July 2024.\nWIRED previously reported on the dinner on March 15 and another “candlelight” dinner held on March 1 where guests were also invited to spend $1 million per person. That event appeared on the president’s public schedule with a note reading, “The President attends the MAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.”\nThe White House did not answer questions from WIRED about the dinner, security issues or federal guidelines involved with the Signal chat, and whether Waltz or any of the other chat participants will face disciplinary action. A senior administration official told Politico on Monday afternoon that “they are involved in multiple text threads with other administration staffers on what to do with Waltz.”\n“As President Trump said, the attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective. President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in an email to WIRED, repeating her earlier statement from Monday afternoon on The Atlantic’s story.\nWIRED has also reported that business leaders could secure a one-on-one meeting with Trump for $5 million at Mar-a-Lago. The $5 million meetings have become a “hot ticket” in the business community, a source familiar with them previously told WIRED.",

    "content_text": "Genetic testing company 23andMe, once a Silicon Valley darling valued at $6 billion, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late Sunday as it prepares for a sale of the business. CEO Anne Wojcicki, who cofounded the company in 2006, has also stepped down after months of failed attempts to take the firm private.\nAs uncertainty about the company’s future reaches its peak, all eyes are on the trove of deeply personal—and potentially valuable—genetic data that 23andMe holds. Privacy advocates have long warned that the risk of entrusting genetic data to any institution is twofold—the organization could fail to protect it, but it could also hand over customer data to a new entity that they may not trust and didn’t choose.\nCalifornia attorney general Rob Bonta reminded consumers in an alert on Friday that Californians have a legal right to ask that an organization delete their data. 23andMe customers in other states and countries largely do not have the same protections, though there is also a right to deletion for health data in Washington state’s My Health My Data Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Regardless of residency, all 23andMe customers should consider downloading anything they want to keep from the service and should then attempt to delete their information.\n“This situation really brings home the point that there is still no national health privacy law in the US protecting your rights unless you live in California or Washington,” says Andrea Downing, an independent security researcher and cofounder of the patient-led digital rights nonprofit The Light Collective. “Meanwhile, we continue to evolve our understanding of how genetic information has value, but also has unique vulnerability.”\nJohn Verdi, senior vice president of policy at the Future of Privacy Forum, says 23andMe’s new owner could revise the company’s privacy policies for new customers and new data collection, but the data it has already collected from current customers is subject to existing terms. “The company has legal obligations regarding information collected under the current policies,” he says.\nStill, researchers emphasize that in practice, such a large transition will create real data exposure that is outside of 23andMe customers’ control. “In my opinion, these privacy policies—especially in the context of acquisitions in the venture capital and private equity space—aren’t worth the paper they’re printed on,” says longtime security researcher and data privacy advocate Kenn White. “For regular people out there who use these services, you’re pretty much on your own. My advice is to request your data get deleted as soon as possible.”\nTo delete your genetic data through 23andMe’s website, log in and then go to Settings in your profile. Scroll to 23andMe Data and then click View. At this point, you can choose to download a copy of your genetic information. Then scroll to Delete Data and click Permanently Delete Data. Once you initiate the process, you’ll receive an email from 23andMe to confirm. Click the link in the email to complete the deletion process. Additionally, you can direct 23andMe to destroy the biological sample it used to extract your DNA data if you previously authorized the company to keep it. Go to Settings and then Preferences.\nYou can also opt in to and out of participating in research at any time by updating your consent status in your account settings. If you opt out, 23andMe will stop using your information for research going forward and will discontinue use of your data within 30 days. This does not affect studies that have already been completed.\n23andMe has never been profitable and has struggled to revamp its business model since it went public in 2021. Demand for its ancestry and health testing kits has been declining for years. And data privacy has had a role to play in the company’s dwindling fortunes after the company was hit with a major data breach in December 2023 that affected millions of customers. The incident led to a class action lawsuit, which 23andMe agreed to settle for $30 million.\nLast summer, Wojcicki filed a proposal to take the company private, which was rejected by 23andMe’s board of directors. Shortly after, the company shuttered its in-house drug discovery unit, and its board members resigned en masse over Wojcicki’s strategic direction.\n23andMe says it intends to continue operating as usual throughout the sale process and that there are no immediate changes to the way it stores, manages, or protects customer data. In an open letter to customers, the company said it will “seek to find a partner who shares our commitment to customer data privacy and allows our mission of helping people access, understand and benefit from the human genome to live on.” But the direction of 23andMe will ultimately be in the hands of whoever takes over the company.\n“If there is a new owner that comes out of the bankruptcy process, that new owner steps into the shoes of 23andMe and takes over those assets,” says Jennifer Wagner, an assistant professor of law, policy, and engineering and anthropology at Penn State University.\n“They would still be bound by the complex web of contractual agreements that are in place right now with users,” Wagner adds. “But I think it does give rise to some uncertainty in terms of whether or not a new player would have the same values or that same kind of culture that 23andMe was trying to cultivate.”\nUpdated 7:15 pm ET, March 24, 2025 to correct the date 23andMe formally went public.",

CEO Anne Wojcicki, who cofounded the company in 2006, has also stepped down after months of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-genomic-testing-financial-results-earnings-anne-wojcicki/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">failed attempts</a> to take the firm private.</p><p class=\"paywall\">As <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/is-23andme-dead-at-home-genetic-testing-anne-wojcicki/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">uncertainty</a> about the company’s future reaches its peak, all eyes are on the trove of deeply personal—and potentially valuable—genetic data that 23andMe holds. Privacy advocates have long warned that the risk of entrusting genetic data to any institution is twofold—the organization could fail to protect it, but it could also hand over customer data to a new entity that they may not trust and didn’t choose.</p><p class=\"paywall\">California attorney general Rob Bonta reminded consumers in <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-urgently-issues-consumer-alert-23andme-customers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an alert</a> on Friday that Californians have a legal right to ask that an organization delete their data. 23andMe customers in other states and countries largely do not have the same protections, though there is also a right to deletion for health data in Washington state’s My Health My Data Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Regardless of residency, all 23andMe customers should consider downloading anything they want to keep from the service and should then attempt to delete their information.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">“This situation really brings home the point that there is still no national health privacy law in the US protecting your rights unless you live in California or Washington,” says Andrea Downing, an independent security researcher and cofounder of the patient-led digital rights nonprofit The Light Collective. “Meanwhile, we continue to evolve our understanding of how genetic information has value, but also has unique vulnerability.”</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">John Verdi, senior vice president of policy at the Future of Privacy Forum, says 23andMe’s new owner could revise the company’s privacy policies for new customers and new data collection, but the data it has already collected from current customers is subject to existing terms. “The company has legal obligations regarding information collected under the current policies,” he says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Still, researchers emphasize that in practice, such a large transition will create real data exposure that is outside of 23andMe customers’ control. “In my opinion, these privacy policies—especially in the context of acquisitions in the venture capital and private equity space—aren’t worth the paper they’re printed on,” says longtime security researcher and data privacy advocate Kenn White. “For regular people out there who use these services, you’re pretty much on your own. My advice is to request your data get deleted as soon as possible.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">To delete your genetic data through 23andMe’s website, log in and then go to <strong>Settings</strong> in your profile. Scroll to <strong>23andMe Data</strong> and then click <strong>View</strong>. At this point, you can choose to download a copy of your genetic information. Then scroll to <strong>Delete Data</strong> and click <strong>Permanently Delete Data</strong>. Once you initiate the process, you’ll receive an email from 23andMe to confirm. Click the link in the email to complete the deletion process. Additionally, you can direct 23andMe to destroy the biological sample it used to extract your DNA data if you previously authorized the company to keep it.

    "content_text": "When Ryan Lackey has traveled to countries like Russia or China, he has taken certain precautions: Instead of his usual gear, the Seattle-based security researcher and chief security officer of a cryptocurrency insurance firm brings a locked-down Chromebook and an iPhone that's set up to sync with a separate, nonsensitive Apple account. He wipes both before every trip and loads only the minimum data he'll need. Lackey has gone so far as to keep separate travel sets for each country, so that he can forensically analyze the devices when he gets home to check for signs of each country's tampering.\nNow, Lackey says, the countries that warrant that paranoid approach to travel might include not just Russia and China but also the United States—if not for Americans like him, then for anyone with a foreign passport who might come under the increasingly draconian and unpredictable scrutiny of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). \"All of this applies to America more than it has in the past,\" says Lackey. \"If I thought I were likely to be a targeted person, I would go through this same level of protection.\"\nSince the start of the second Trump administration, there appears to be an uptick in foreign visitors to the US being denied entry, resulting in people being sent back to their original destinations or being held in detention. Citizens from Germany, the UK, and France have all reported being detained, in some cases for weeks, or denied entry when attempting to enter the US—including several individuals who say they are legal residents with Green Cards. France’s education minister said one French scientist was denied entry after immigration officials searched his phone and found conversations where “he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration’s research policy.” The stricter enforcement of visa and travel permit regulations has led to officials in Germany and Britain to change their travel guidance, with Britain warning that rules are enforced “strictly.”\nThat de facto border crackdown is set to become far more explicit if the Trump administration follows through on a plan to enact a new “travel ban” on more than 40 countries, which would reportedly bar entry entirely from at least 10 nations and subject visitors from another five to new scrutiny and automatic interviews at the border. Another 26 countries would fall into a third category where their status will be decided in the 60 days after the policy goes into effect.\nAll of these changes suggest that US borders are about to become far less friendly places to foreigners and even to Americans returning from abroad. And these new border enforcement measures will no doubt be accompanied by aggressive attempts at surveillance extending to travellers’ electronic devices—a threat to digital privacy and free expression that extends to foreigners and US residents alike.\n“We’re seeing extraordinarily disturbing examples of retaliatory action based on people's speech and political opinions,” says Nathan Wessler, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “When that’s combined with really sweeping authority to mine the contents of our phones and laptops, looking at things we've written, things people have sent us, it should be a particular cause for concern for people across the political spectrum—and people with all kinds of citizenship and immigration statuses.”\nIn fact, Customs and Border Protection has long considered US borders and airports a kind of loophole in the US Constitution's Fourth Amendment protections, one that allows them wide latitude to detain travelers and search their devices. For years, the agency has used that opportunity to hold border-crossers on the slightest suspicion and demand access to their computers and phones, with little formal cause or oversight.\nCitizens are far from immune. CBP detainees from journalists to filmmakers to security researchers have all had their devices taken out of their hands by agents.\nAs those intrusions become more common and aggressive in the second Trump era, WIRED has assembled the following advice from legal and security experts to help preserve your digital privacy while crossing American borders. But take all of these strategies with caution: Given CBP’s unpredictable—and in many areas undocumented—practices, none of the experts WIRED spoke to claimed to have a privacy panacea for the American border.\nThis article was first published in February 2017 and updated in March 2025 to reflect changes in technology and the second Trump administration. WIRED’s guide to protecting yourself against government surveillance includes more security and privacy advice.\nPhone Home\nFirst, if you have any reason to think you could be detained or questioned at the border, alert a lawyer or a loved one who can contact a lawyer before going through customs, and contact them again when you get out. If you are detained, you may not be able to access your devices or otherwise have the opportunity to reach the outside world. And in the worst-case scenario of a lengthy detention, you'll want someone advocating for your release and legal representation.\nLock Down Devices\nIf customs officials do take your devices, don't make their intrusion easy. Encrypt your hard drive with tools like BitLocker, Veracrypt, or Apple's Filevault, and choose a strong passphrase. On your phone, set a strong PIN. Using hard-to-crack alphanumeric code to unlock your phone rather than a four digit PIN or biometrics is the strongest approach to securing the device. On an iPhone, disable Siri from the lock screen by switching off Allow Siri When Locked under the Siri menu in Settings.\nRemember also to turn your devices off before entering customs: Hard-drive encryption tools offer full protection only when a computer is fully powered down. If you use FaceID, your iPhone is safest when it's turned off, too, since it requires a PIN rather than a face scan when first booted, resolving any ambiguity about whether border officials can compel you to unlock the device with your biometrics.\nIn recent years, Apple and Google have made it possible to separate sensitive apps from being shown with others on your phone—placing them in a separate folder from other apps and protecting them with another layer of authentication. Android’s Private Spaces can be turned on in the Security and privacy settings menu, while long pressing an app on iOS will bring up the option to place it in a hidden folder.\nFinally, Wessler recommends that travelers be sure to update their operating systems on both laptops and phones before crossing the border. That’s because CBP could, in some cases, use tools like Cellebrite or GrayKey to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in those devices, accessing them without the user unlocking them. “It may be that if your operating system is six months out of date, your device is vulnerable,” Wessler says. “The newest version may not be.”\nKeep Passwords Secret\nThis is the tricky part. American citizens can't be deported for refusing to give up passwords for social media accounts or encrypted devices, says the ACLU's Wessler. That means if you stand your ground and don't reveal passwords or PINs, you may be detained and your devices confiscated—even sent off to a forensic facility—but you'll eventually get through with your privacy far more intact than if you divulge secrets. \"They can seize your device, even for months while they try to break into it,\" says Wessler. \"But you’re going to get home.\" (Despite the Trump administration’s shocking treatment in some cases of foreign permanent residents, this protection applies to green card holders too, Wessler says.)\nBe warned, however, that denying customs officials access can at the very least lead to hours of uncertain detention in a bleak, windowless CBP office. At some US airports and in various states, court rulings have put limitations and restrictions on what CBP officials can do to access your devices, but there’s little guarantee those restrictions will be followed in practice if border agents have your computer or phone in their custody without oversight.\nBroadly, the CBP outlines two types of device searches: basic, where an officer “manually” reviews a device’s content; and an advanced search where a device is connected to external equipment and its contents can be reviewed, copied, or analyzed. The latter search requires a “reasonable suspicion” of a crime, CBP says. The agency’s official guidance avoids explicitly saying people are required to hand over passwords, skirting around the issue by saying devices should be presented “in a condition that allows for the examination.”\n“If the electronic device cannot be inspected because it is protected by a passcode or encryption or other security mechanism, that device may be subject to exclusion, detention, or other appropriate action or disposition,” the agency says online.\nFor non-Americans coming to the US on a visa or from a visa-waiver country, Wessler warns that they face a far starker dilemma: Refuse to give up a passcode or PIN and you may be denied entry. “There’s a very practical assessment people have to make about what's most important to them,” he says. “Getting into the country but sacrificing privacy or protecting your privacy—but risking that you may be turned around at the border.”\nMinimize the Data You Carry\nFor the most vulnerable travelers, there’s one clear solution to that dilemma: The best way to keep customs away from your data is simply not to travel with it. Instead, like Lackey, set up travel devices that store the minimum of sensitive data. Don't link those \"dirty\" devices to your personal accounts, and when you do have to create a linked account—as with an Apple ID for iOS devices—create fresh ones with unique usernames and passwords. \"If they ask for access and you can’t refuse, you want to be able to give them access without losing any sensitive information,\" says Lackey.\n(Social media accounts, admittedly, can't be so easily ditched. Some security experts recommend creating secondary personas that can be offered up to customs officials while keeping a more sensitive account secret. But if CBP agents do link your identity with an account you tried to hide, the result could be longer detention and, for noncitizens, even denial of entry.)\nIf you can’t create a separate travel device, the Electronic Frontier Foundation also suggests logging out of apps and cloud services—such as Google Drive, or MicrosoftOne Drive—so that border agents can’t access documents or data you are storing remotely. Backing up data, such as photos or files, to the cloud services before you travel can help to remove data from the phone.\n“The only sure way to protect yourself is to not carry information with you or to carry as little as possible,” says the ACLU’s Wessler. “As long as you have a device and there's stuff on it, that's potentially vulnerable to search.”\nThat vulnerability to search comes in part from the fact that privacy rights for digital devices at the border remains troublingly unsettled in US law, says UC Davis law professor Elizabeth Joh. While the Supreme Court decision in Riley v. California in 2014 declared warrantless searches of devices at the time of arrest unconstitutional, no case has set such a precedent for the American border—much less for non-Americans seeking those same privacy rights.\nSince 2014, several federal appeals courts have come to conflicting opinions about when it’s constitutional for customs and border agents to search electronic devices, but the Supreme Court has yet to weigh in. Until it does, the border zone will remain in a kind of legal limbo.\nThe government, after all, has the power to open bags crossing into its territory or even dismantle cars to search for contraband, Joh points out. \"What does that mean in an age when people bring their digital devices across borders? The Supreme Court hasn’t spoken to that issue,\" Joh says. \"The real problem here is there's still no good set of protections for a portal into your private life.\"",

Last week, The New York Times reported that the White House is adding Musk-owned SpaceX’s Starlink Wi-Fi “to improve Wi-Fi connectivity on the complex,” according to a statement from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The White House's Starlink internet service is reportedly being donated by the company.\nSpotty internet is an annoying but highly solvable problem that WIRED has reported on extensively. Of course, the White House is a highly complex organization operating out of a historic building, but network security researchers, government contractors, and former intelligence analysts with years of experience in US federal government security all tell WIRED that adding Starlink Wi-Fi in a seemingly rushed and haphazard way is an inefficient and counterproductive approach to solving connectivity issues. And they emphasized that it could set problematic precedents across the US government: that new pieces of technology can simply be layered into an environment at will without adequate oversight and monitoring.\n“This is shadow IT, creating a network to bypass existing controls,” alleges Nicholas Weaver, a member of the nonprofit International Computer Science Institute's network security team and a computer science lecturer at UC Davis. He adds that while secret and top secret information is typically (but not always) processed only on special, separate federal networks that have no wireless access, the security and uniformity of White House Wi-Fi is still extremely important to national security. “A network like the White House unclassified side is still going to be very sensitive,” he says.\n“Just like the Biden Administration did on numerous occasions, the White House is working to improve WiFi connectivity on the complex,” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt tells WIRED in a statement.\nA White House source who asked not to be named supported the switch, arguing that in some areas of the campus, “the old Wi-Fi was trash.”\nResearchers point out that while Starlink is a robust commercial ISP like any other, it is not clear that it is being implemented in compliance with White House Communication Agency requirements. If the controls on the White House Starlink Wi-Fi are more lax than on other White House Wi-Fi, it could introduce security exposures and blind spots in network monitoring for anomalous activity.\n“The only reason they'd need Starlink would be to bypass existing security controls that are in place from WHCA,” claims former NSA hacker Jake Williams. “The biggest issues would be: First, if they don't have full monitoring of the Starlink connection. And second, if it allows remote management tools, so they could get remote access back into the White House networks. Obviously anyone could abuse that access.”\nOne baffling aspect of the arrangement is that Starlink and other satellite internet is designed to be used in places that have little or no access to terrestrial internet service—in other words, places where there are no reliable fiber lines or no wired infrastructure at all. Instead of a traditional ISP modem, Starlink customers get special panels that they install on a roof or other outdoor place to receive connectivity from orbiting satellites. The New York Times reported, though, that the White House Starlink panels are actually installed miles away at a White House data center that is routing the connectivity over existing fiber lines. Multiple sources emphasized to WIRED that this setup is bizarre.\n“It is extra stupid to go satellite to fiber to actual site,” ICSI's Weaver says. “Starlink is inferior service anyplace where you have wire-line internet already available and, even in places which don't, inferior if you have reasonable line of sight to a cell tower.”\nWeaver and others note that Starlink is a robust product and isn't inherently unreliable just because it is delivered via satellite. But in a location where fiber lines are highly available and, ultimately, the service is being delivered via those lines anyway, the setup is deeply inefficient.\nWhile Starlink as a service is technically reliable, incorporating it in the White House could create a long-term federal dependence on an Elon Musk–controlled service, which could create future instabilities. After European officials raised concerns earlier this month on whether Starlink might stop serving Ukraine, Musk posted on social media: “To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals … We would never do such a thing or use it as a bargaining chip.”\nUpdated at 3 pm ET, March 24, 2025, to add comment from the White House, additional details from a White House source, and further context around the transmission of classified materials.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nWhether you’re hammering out intervals on the track, cruising a chatty social run, or lacing up for the long haul on the trails, a good pair of running shorts is mission critical. The best running shorts offer killer comfort and total freedom to move. They wick sweat, dry fast, and ward off unwanted chafe. The only problem? There’s hundreds of styles from dozens of brands, and not all shorts are created equal.\nDon’t fear, we’ve got you—and your downstairs—covered. As one of WIRED’s running gear experts, I’ve logged hundreds of miles testing the latest shorts, and I’m here to help you sort the winners from those that come up, well erm, short. Here’s my tried and tested picks for your bottom half. Be sure to check out our other sport and fitness buying guides, including the Best Running Shoes, the Best Running Underwear, the Best Treadmills, and the Best Merino Wool.\nDifferent Types of Running Shorts\nRunning shorts come in a wide variety of styles. Shorter shorts tend to be suited to shorter, faster runs, while two-in-one shorts and longer lengths are often used for longer distances and trails. You may find that there's a lot of crossover. Long inseams and superlight fabrics are now suitable for speed while offering good coverage. Even short shorts now offer storage for a phone or gels.\nShort shorts: 3-inch and 5-inch shorts are cut high on the thigh from lightweight fabrics, designed for total freedom and a barely-there feel. Storage, where there is any, tends to be limited. These are most at home on the track or a marathon start line.\n2-in-1 shorts: These pair a tighter—and sometimes longer leg—liner short that acts as built-in underwear, with a lighter, baggier outer short. Good for colder climates and arguably more appropriate for your post-run coffee stop.\nHalf-tights: Dropping just above the knee they offer a tight, second-skin fit, excellent support and are made to maximize mobility. Mainly found on the track or road, this aesthetic leaves little to the imagination.\nMax-storage shorts: Designed for longer runs, ultras, and adventures where you need to carry more kit with easy access, these shorts tend to also be the hybrid 2-in-1 with built-in liners, but the main aim is to beef up storage with built-in mesh belts, thigh pockets, and zippered back pockets.\nFeatures to Look For\nHere's what to look for in a pair of running shorts.\nDoes it have a liner? Some shorts come with built in liners for added support. These range from loose net briefs to longer-lined shorts. Some of them add compression to help prevent the little micro tears that happen with excess muscle movement, while some net briefs can increase your chafe risk. It pays to check the seams on the liner shorts, too. Remember, the flatter the seams the less chafe risk. It’s always useful if they're accommodating enough so you can bring your own running underwear to the start line.\nDoes it have side splits? Small details sometimes make a big difference and side splits–often found in the shorter race shorts–are important for boosting range of motion, helping the shorts to move with you when you pick up the tempo.\nRoll up. It’s often overlooked, but the waistband and leg cuffs can be critical for comfort. The best shorts offer a wide, soft-lined waistband with drawstrings for tweaking the fit. The bands and leg cuffs should be secure enough to avoid rolling up, but not so tight they cut in.\nCan you carry a phone? Most runners require some stash space for a phone, fuel, and even hydration. The good news is that most brands offer handy storage. If your style is more packhorse than Prefontaine, look for shorts with built-in storage belts, zippered back pockets and drop-in pockets on the liner briefs. Your phone, keys, and other essentials shouldn't bounce about as you run.\nHow Low Should You Go?\nLet’s talk about inseam—aka the length from the crotch to the leg cuffs. The most common inseam lengths are 3, 5, 7, and 9 inches. The old adage says, the shorter the shorts, the faster the runner, but what works for you boils down to personal preference.\nThe shorter the inseam, the less material there is to limit your movement. If you’re smashing out 400-meter intervals, you’ll benefit from the additional freedom. It’ll also keep things cool in the summer, but the 3-inchers are probably reserved for the brave in winter. When you push the distance and clock more time on feet, longer-inseam shorts not only offer extra protection from the elements—the sun and the cold—they can also limit the chafe risk from rubbing thighs.\nIf there is a happy balance between modesty and free movement, a lightweight non-liner 7-inch short is probably it.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nI will use a carry-on for the rest of my life. Last summer, I had an epically bad experience with checking bags on a family vacation at the worst airport in the world. This airport is Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia. (Never going there again! See ya, Dulles!) After waiting in innumerable long, confusing lines with big bags and small children, watching my husband sprint around in vain attempts to figure out some mysterious shortcut, I made a solemn vow to never, ever check a bag ever again.\nEven if you're not a frequent flier, having a good carry-on at hand (or several) can save you so much time and energy. Would you prefer to not even mess with the overhead bin? Check out our guide to How to Fly With Only a Personal Item. We also have other guides to the Best Laptop Backpacks and the Best Toiletry Bags.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nUpdated March 2025: We added the Carl Friedrik Carry-On, the Peak Design Roller Pro, the Casetify Bounce Suitcase, and the Antler Carry-On with Pocket Luggage. We also updated links and prices.\nHow We Tested\nMembers of the Gear Team have taken at least two flights with each of the bags in this roundup. Each bag has different features, and we look at materials, weight, and size. We test the durability of the materials by stuffing bags into overhead bins and under seats. We check how well and how smoothly the wheels glide; if the handle feels sturdy and if it accommodates a wide range of heights; whether the straps are durable and can fit our hands; and if the zippers will stand up to frequent overstuffing.\nCheck the Airline Size Requirements\nIf you take one tip away from this guide, let this be it: Save yourself the aggravation at the airport, check the size requirements, and grab a tape measure. If you're in doubt, pick a soft-sided bag so you can squeeze it into the airline’s sizer box when you're about to board. Each airline has different requirements; we've included several airlines here.\n|Airline\n|Size Requirements\n|American\n|22 x 14 x 9 inches\n|Ryanair\n|22 x 16 x 8 inches\n|Delta\n|22 x 14 x 9 inches\n|EasyJet\n|17.7 x 14 x 7.8 inches\n|Alaska\n|22 x 14 x 9 inches\n|Frontier\n|24 x 10 x 16 inches\n|JetBlue\n|22 x 14 x 9 inches\n|Air Canada\n|21.5 x 9 x 15.5 inches\nHonorable Mentions\nWe try a lot of bags! Here are others that just did not earn a place in our top picks.\nCarl Friedrik Carry-On for $545: This British brand positions itself as a quiet luxury bag. It has a distinctive appearance, with leather accents and typical high-end features like smoothly-rolling Hinamoto wheels, a built-in lock, and well-functioning latches. This is what you get if you want a classy appearance but don't want disgruntled baggage handlers to target your Rimowa.\nAer Carry-On for $299: Aer's admittedly more expensive carry-on has very nice Hinamoto ball bearings as well as wheel locks, for when you're taking the shuttle to the car rental office.\nCasetify Bounce Suitcase for $399: Casetify's phone cases always earn a spot in our phone case roundups because they're cute and customizable. So is the company's first piece of luggage, which is adorable and which you can monogram. Unfortunately, it's also smaller and more expensive than most of our other picks.\nBeis Carry-On Roller for $238: WIRED reviewer Nena Farrell tried the viral Beis suitcase and loved its sleek looks, variety of colors, and extras like a built-in weight gauge and a retractable strap that lets you clip a backpack or duffel to the front.\nAmazon Basics Expandable Hardside Carry-On for $63: Getting on a plane in two days and need a functional roller bag you don't have to drop a lot of money on? This Amazon Basics bag will totally do the trick. The wheels certainly don't roll like a Rimowa and the zippers far too often snag, but it's very light and the textured ABS shell doesn't scuff easily.—Martin Cizmar\nSamsonite Outline Pro Carry-On for $200: This is a hard-side, four-wheeled spinner carry-on made from an outer shell of durable polypropylene. The interior fabric is made from 100 percent recycled plastic bottles, and it has a “WetPak” storage pocket for keeping damp items separated from the rest of your luggage.",

Learn more.\nWhether you’re buying your first mechanical keyboard or doing research for your endgame build, keycaps are a huge part of not only your keyboard’s appearance but also its all-around typing experience. The keycaps you choose can have a massive impact on how you type, what it feels like, and what your keyboard sounds like. That's why it’s important to find the right set for your personal needs.\nHowever, there are a lot of different details to consider when looking at keycaps, and it can be overwhelming if you’re new to the hobby or out of the loop on certain developments. I’ve put together this guide to serve as a jumping-off point into the world of keycaps. Here's everything you need to know.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nMake Sure the Keycaps Will Fit\nThe most important part of any keycap set is to make sure the keycaps will fit your keyboard. If not, you’ll either be stuck not using the set at all, or mixing your brand-new keycaps with old ones for full coverage. To start, here’s what you’ll want to look for.\nMake sure your keycaps fit your switches! Most modern keyboards use standard MX-style switches with a plus-shaped stem. These have become ubiquitous, and as a result, almost every keycap set offered today will be compatible with them. However, if you want to use keycaps from an older keyboard, there’s a good chance they won’t fit a newer one.\nThe three most common “alternative” switches are Alps switches, which have a small minus-shaped stem, Topre (also referred to as EC) switches, which have a circular stem, and Kailh Choc low-profile switches, which have two prongs on the stem. These keycaps cannot be used on an MX-style keyboard, but any keycap listings will clearly label them.\nNext, you'll want to check layouts. While most keyboards have adopted fairly standardized layouts today, a few stand out. The best modern example is the HHKB Studio, which has unique G, H, and B keys, plus a shorter-than-average spacebar, none of which are included in the “standard” keycap set. Some keycap sets will have specific kits to cover more unusual layouts though.\nMake sure your keycap set has full coverage. While most sets today include everything needed for a full-size keyboard, I have seen an influx of keycap sets that sell the number pad separately in exchange for a lower base price, and the same has even been the case for arrows and function row keys, particularly on budget-oriented (or customizable) keycap sets.\nKeycap Profiles and Sculpts\nAfter you’ve figured out what kind of keycaps you need for your keyboard, you should start thinking about what shape you want these keycaps to be. The shape of your keycaps will have the largest impact on how typing feels, and on how comfortable typing is. The most basic aspects of this are the height of the keycap, the shape it is sculpted in, and the presence of different sculpted rows.\nBut first, it’s worth noting that there is no standardized naming convention for keycap profiles—the names themselves are arbitrary and are determined entirely by the keycap manufacturer. Some have logical names (like how OSA keycaps are a fusion of OEM—original equipment manufacturer—and SA—spherical all—sculpts), while others are a bit silly (PBS stands for Penguin Belly Slide).\nA keycap’s height is the most immediately obvious aspect of its profile. Typically, keycaps are sorted into high-profile, medium-profile, and low-profile categories, which are all determined based on the height they extend past the top of the switch. The most standard height is the Cherry profile, which most people have likely typed on before. These sit a bit above the outer bezel of the keyboard, with the highest point sitting at 9.8 mm and the lowest point at 7.3 mm, and can be easily used without a wrist rest.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, SA keycaps (which you may have seen on the computers in Severance) have a high point of almost 17 mm and a low point of 12.6 mm. The difference between the tallest and shortest keycaps is more drastic, and the average height is typically higher, resulting in a deeper typing sound and a greater need for a wrist rest.\nSome keycap profiles, like Cherry and SA, will have different keys depending on the row they are in. These rows are typically denoted as R1 (row 1), R2, and R3. R4 (or sometimes R5) sits at the very top of the keyboard, and R1 is at the bottom. These separate rows will typically have different heights and angles, which can make reaching the top rows easier and make typing more comfortable. However, some people prefer a uniform layout where every row of keys has an identical height and shape. There aren’t many uniform profiles available, but the most prominent—SA and PBS—are still fairly popular and easy to find in multiple colors.\nThe sculpt of the keycap also indicates the shape of the keycap’s face. The two most popular sculpts are cylindrical and spherical. Cylindrical keycaps will have a U-shaped indentation with peaks on either side and a dip in the center, while spherical keycaps are going to be more bowl-like, with peaks on all four corners and a divot in the center. Popular keyboard maker Keychron typically ships its keycaps with OSA-profile spherical keycaps, while most keyboards from Razer, Corsair, and other big names use Cherry or OEM profile keycaps with a cylindrical sculpt.\nSome keycap profiles are perfectly flat, although these are uncommon and typically only used on keyboards with low-profile switches and/or ortho-linear layouts.\nWhat Material Do You Want?\nA lot of different materials are used to make keycaps. These are some of the most common ones you can find in full keycap sets:\nABS: This is the most common material for a keyboard’s original keycaps to be made in. ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) plastic is everywhere in your life, from LEGO sets to car interiors, and it comes in countless different finishes, textures, and levels of quality. While the thinner ABS plastic used in budget keyboards may not be high quality, some ABS keycaps, like those from GMK and Signature Plastics, are considered to be the best of any material. Regardless of quality, ABS plastic will almost inevitably shine over time the more you type on it—some people avoid it for this, while others see having “shined” keycaps as a badge of honor. ABS is preferred for its bright and vibrant colors, durability, and smooth feel when typing. ABS also creates a higher-pitched sound when typing compared to other keycap materials.\nPBT: A large percentage of aftermarket “custom” keycaps are made from PBT (polybutylene terephthalate). This material is often a higher-end plastic that focuses on thickness and rigidity while having a more textured top when compared to ABS. Colors on PBT keycaps are often not as vibrant, although the difference between ABS and PBT today is much less significant than it used to be. One of the largest upsides of PBT is that it doesn’t easily shine over time, even after decades of use in point-of-sale systems, meaning your keycaps will always look as good as the day you got them. PBT typically creates a deeper typing signature than ABS.\nCeramic: Ceramic keycaps are one of the most recent developments in the keycap world. They are primarily made by Cerakey, a relatively new brand from China. These keycaps provide a deeper typing sound some people describe as marbly. When I used ceramic keycaps previously, I found them to break easily because of their brittle ceramic stems. However, modern ceramic keycaps use a plastic stem to avoid this issue. The largest benefits of a keycap like this are the typing feel and sound: The keycaps themselves are smooth and slick to type on, and they create a deeper and more resonant typing sound compared to plastic keycaps.\nMetal: While individual metal keycaps have been around for a long time, full metal keycap sets only became popular in recent years as interest in custom mechanical keyboards increased. A full set of metal keycaps will typically cost upwards of $200, and installing them may require some supporting upgrades to your keyboard such as a heavier switch underneath the spacebar or additional sound dampening to reduce metal pinging when typing.\nIn writing this article, I tested two sets of metal keycaps: One from NovelKeys, and the other from Awekeys. I had minor issues with fit and finish in both kits, although the NovelKeys set was generally clean and free of manufacturing errors on visible surfaces. On the other hand, the Awekeys set had multiple keys with visible pitting and surface imperfections.\nMy largest issue with both was one that seemed to be unavoidable: Due to the extreme precision required to manufacture metal keycaps and the relatively lenient manufacturing tolerances of plastic switches, some keycaps in both sets had trouble fitting onto switches, either being too tight or too loose. With the Awekeys set, some were so loose that I could flip the keyboard over or release a key after pressing it down and they would come off. The company recommended using an included tool to bend the keycap stem back into place, which was successful but somewhat nerve-wracking, especially on such an expensive set of keycaps. In my experience, the stems were stiff enough that it was necessary to use a hammer in conjunction with the tool to adjust the stems properly.\nMetal keycaps will feel more substantial than plastic keycaps, but will also create a higher-pitched typing sound than most other keycaps, especially in a keyboard with a metal plate. I found one of the main appeals of these keycaps, the cold and metallic feel when typing, quickly dissipates as the keycaps absorb heat from your fingers, and after a few minutes of typing, they are hard to differentiate from smooth plastic. However, their density can make a keypress feel slightly more crisp and immediate compared to a standard keycap, especially on a lighter tactile switch.\nPrinting, Sublimating, and Other Lettering\nOne of the most important parts of a set of keycaps is the text on top of them. Even if you already know where your keys are, they bring a sense of character and style to the keyboard, whether you prefer them centered, oriented to one side, or not there at all.\nThe text on top of keycaps is referred to as “legends,” and the secondary text on a keycap is the “sub-legend.” The main legends will denote the primary function of the keys, while sub-legends will indicate a secondary function, a different language, or a callback to another keyboard with interesting sub-legends (like Space Cadet keycaps). There are countless details and specifics on how the legends can be designed and why they may look a certain way, but it ultimately comes down to personal preference and use case. What’s more important here is how the text is put onto the keycaps.\nDoubleshot: Often considered the gold standard of keycap legends, doubleshot legends will never fade or wear off. This is because the legend is made from plastic instead of being printed onto the keycap. This is done through a two-part injection molding process where the legend is cast in one color of plastic then the rest of the keycap is molded around it, resulting in a legend that goes all the way through the keycap instead of eventually wearing away as the keycap is worn down by typing. The largest benefits of these keycaps are the crispness of the legends, their durability, and the ability to easily combine high-contrast colors, but the cost of making new molds means the options for different fonts and icons are limited compared to printed keycaps, and high-end doubleshot keycaps are often more expensive than other options. While doubleshot legends were previously only available for ABS keycaps, they are now available with PBT keycaps too.\nTripleshot: For keycaps with differently colored sub-legends, a tripleshot keycap is a great option that is incredibly hard to find and more expensive than doubleshot legends. Only a few manufacturers currently produce tripleshot keycaps (such as Domikey and PBTfans), and they are limited almost entirely to Japanese sub-legends.\nDye sublimation: This is the most common printing method for PBT keycaps. Dye sublimation can fully impress the dye into the keycap instead of having it sit on top, much like dyeing a piece of clothing, creating a finish that will rarely wear away. This process can also produce incredibly vibrant and precise legends, which has allowed for fun and unusual keycap sets like RGBEnglish and 21KB’s Rainbow Road keycaps. While dye sublimation can last a long time, it can have some downsides. The quality of the legends can vary greatly, with higher-end keycaps looking indistinguishable from doubleshot keycaps, but less expensive options appearing fuzzy or blurry. In addition, dye sublimation—much like any other dyeing process—can usually only apply colors darker than the base material. This is why most dye-sublimated keycaps will either have a lighter base color or will only print black on top of darker keycaps.\nReverse dye sublimation: Reversing this process allows for the entire keycap except for the legends to be dyed, which can create dark keycaps with light legends. However, this process is more difficult than standard sublimation, with mixed results over the years. Some sets of reverse dye-sub keycaps will look fantastic, but other times they will have fading around the edges, inconsistent color coverage, or issues with the sharpness of the legends. In addition, the printing is more susceptible to scratches than raw PBT. However, when done right, reverse dye-sub can create unique color schemes not otherwise possible with dye sublimation.\nUV printing: While not as common today as it used to be, UV printing is still popular for creating vibrant, multicolored text on keycaps. UV printing is primarily found on GMK keycaps with unique or multicolored sub-legends, where it is used to add color or design to a key without the need to manufacture additional molds. This printing method has a higher likelihood of fading over time, and can potentially have a slightly raised feel when typing but it has advanced enough in recent years that any well-made set of keycaps with UV printing will still work well for regular use. UV printing is also commonly used for transparent keycaps with solid legends.\nPad printing: This is the method basically all budget-oriented office keyboards today use. In this method, the prints are applied directly onto the keycaps using a silicone pad and sit on top of the keycaps. Inexpensive pad-printed keycaps will typically have subtle outlines around the legends and will wear away quickly compared to any other method. However, this printing method is both high-resolution and inexpensive, hence its popularity.\nBuying Keycaps\nGenerally, there are three primary methods of sale for keycaps: In-stock sales, group buys, and preorders. Each has benefits and downsides, and knowing the difference is important when planning your purchase.\nIn-stock sales: This is what most keycap sets will be sold as. These keycaps are readily available somewhere, sitting in a warehouse, and will ship to you after your order has been placed. This will be the most reliable and immediate way to get a set of keycaps.\nGroup buys: With group buys, you give your money to an individual or vendor who will pool all the customers’ money together to order keycap sets directly from a manufacturer. This is how keycaps were purchased for years by enthusiasts, and it is typically the only way to get a guaranteed set of limited-run or small-batch keycaps. The group buy method is done to meet the Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) for a manufacturer to produce a set of keycaps without the vendor needing to purchase all the keycap sets up front and hope they sell. The main concern with group buys is inconsistency: There have been multiple vendors recently who mismanaged money and were unable to fulfill their group buys. Ultimately, this comes down to vetting the vendors you’re buying from and ensuring they have a good reputation within the community. Even then, there is still some risk involved.\nExtra preorders: When placing an order for a group buy, a vendor will typically order a small number of extra keycaps to cover any issues that arise after the sale, and to have additional sets available for people who weren’t able to join the group buy. These are typically called “extras,” and will be made available for preorder once the manufacturer has confirmed how many sets they have produced. While these are never guaranteed, and will typically be more expensive than the initial group buy price, it can be a good way to get a set you missed out on after the fact.\nWhen it comes to pricing, you can essentially pay as much as you want for a set of keycaps. However, some details can help determine or justify the price of a set. The largest determining factor is the manufacturer of a keycap set. Past that, the price is dependent on how many keycaps are in the set and how complicated the manufacturing of a set is.\nDoubleshot ABS keycaps from high-end manufacturers like GMK or Signature Plastics will often run well over $100. This is primarily because these brands are well known for having outstanding color accuracy, durability, and quality control. They are the highest-quality keycaps you can get, but less-expensive keycaps will typically have 90 percent of the quality for 50 percent of the price.\nComing in around or below the $100 mark, PBT keycaps from larger manufacturers like EnjoyPBT will feature a thicker PBT keycap with high-resolution dye-sub printing.\nWith all of this, it can be overwhelming to figure out what keycaps you might want for your keyboard. There are a few starting places great for finding the perfect set of keycaps for you. Some of my preferred shops are:\nCannonkeys has a massive selection of in-stock PBT keycaps in various colors along with a more limited selection of ABS keycaps. The brand designs many of its sets in-house and offers quite a few sets with both retro and modern styling, taking inspiration from pop culture and vintage keyboards.\nNovelkeys is another well-known name in the keyboard world, offering a large selection of ABS and PBT keycap designs. It regularly collaborates with keycap designers, but quite a few of its sets are only available through group buys or limited extras from said group buys.\n21kb is a small manufacturer of beige dye-sub keycaps. While the beige base of these keycaps may not be the most attention-grabbing, the brand has countless options for fun, clever, or otherwise interesting legends that go onto those keycaps, along with the ability to custom-order an individual set to your specifications. These keycaps are some of the highest-quality PBT sets I’ve purchased, and I use them on my primary keyboard.\nDrop is a huge name in the keyboard space, and it has done a lot to advance the world of keycaps. It has large offerings of standard keycaps in everyday color schemes, along with high-profile collaborations (like The Lord of the Rings keycaps) and countless exclusive sets from manufacturers like GMK and Signature Plastics.\nMekibo is a frequent vendor for keycap group buys. The company doesn't stock many keycaps, but I find that every set it offers will be well done and looks great on the right keyboard.\nOmnitype offers a large selection of GMK keycaps, along with its in-house over-the-counter line of keycaps. It has been a large part of the keyboard community for years and continually introduces sets that bring something unique to the table.\nDivinikey has a lot of keycaps, including PBT keycaps you can’t find anywhere else. This is one of the best places to order PBTFans keycaps (Chinese-based KBDFans’ line of keycaps), and there's a good number of sets from other international vendors as well.\nOutside of these shops, there are a few resources to verify the legitimacy of keyboard vendors and get more recommendations. One of the largest is the MK Vendor Trust and Safety System made by keyboard YouTuber TaehaTypes. This system keeps track of keyboard vendors along multiple metrics to ensure products come from a reliable source.",

While most sets today include everything needed for a full-size keyboard, I have seen an influx of keycap sets that sell the number pad separately in exchange for a lower base price, and the same has even been the case for arrows and function row keys, particularly on budget-oriented (or customizable) keycap sets.</p><p id=\"keycap-profiles-and-sculpts\" tabindex=\"-1\"><h2 class=\"paywall\">Keycap Profiles and Sculpts</h2></p><p class=\"paywall\">After you’ve figured out what kind of keycaps you need for your keyboard, you should start thinking about what shape you want these keycaps to be. The shape of your keycaps will have the largest impact on how typing feels, and on how comfortable typing is. The most basic aspects of this are the height of the keycap, the shape it is sculpted in, and the presence of different sculpted rows.</p><p class=\"paywall\">But first, it’s worth noting that there is no standardized naming convention for keycap profiles—the names themselves are arbitrary and are determined entirely by the keycap manufacturer. Some have logical names (like how OSA keycaps are a fusion of OEM—original equipment manufacturer—and SA—spherical all—sculpts), while others are a bit silly (PBS stands for Penguin Belly Slide).</p><p class=\"paywall\">A keycap’s height is the most immediately obvious aspect of its profile. Typically, keycaps are sorted into high-profile, medium-profile, and low-profile categories, which are all determined based on the height they extend past the top of the switch. The most standard height is the Cherry profile, which most people have likely typed on before. These sit a bit above the outer bezel of the keyboard, with the highest point sitting at 9.8 mm and the lowest point at 7.3 mm, and can be easily used without a wrist rest.</p><p class=\"paywall\">On the other side of the spectrum, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/DRqZQmpTgrbg14BtEj7FqAfnvhrm3qSaLyp28Nqm4itk38Qv2jghR8RoiiYXshmeE291iM4vuETPfBX2PFK6NHVzSckctYKsanEeDBZjnNWeettpCLSBcGjsbeTzcyRoWMxbHVAQJJtGiwkPPH4LvsgFboGAHPeRegDUpdrZCqZonrkFrCVFYWt97qPtsRjKVDQTvsN2SUcH1iihNbb2gGEsTsfxVih3AK15Cf7VqLr71bP87KW9V7XQ1oKj119RpFC6JNfprKYhMnmM3fp5PmLQptxAv2CooLHjKS9yDrDkjdrxy3LQdHZ11HjmFrN4TYLRq\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://spkeyboards.com/\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/DRqZQmpTgrbg14BtEj7FqAfnvhrm3qSaLyp28Nqm4itk38Qv2jghR8RoiiYXshmeE291iM4vuETPfBX2PFK6NHVzSckctYKsanEeDBZjnNWeettpCLSBcGjsbeTzcyRoWMxbHVAQJJtGiwkPPH4LvsgFboGAHPeRegDUpdrZCqZonrkFrCVFYWt97qPtsRjKVDQTvsN2SUcH1iihNbb2gGEsTsfxVih3AK15Cf7VqLr71bP87KW9V7XQ1oKj119RpFC6JNfprKYhMnmM3fp5PmLQptxAv2CooLHjKS9yDrDkjdrxy3LQdHZ11HjmFrN4TYLRq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SA keycaps</a> (which you may have seen on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/severance-apple-tv-plus-cognitive-neuroscience/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the computers in <em>Severance</em></a>) have a high point of almost 17 mm and a low point of 12.6 mm.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nSpace heater safety is a lot better than it used to be. Modern space heaters are heavily regulated, especially regarding exposed heating elements and automatic shut-off switches to prevent overheating when a heater tips over or has its vent covered by an errant drape.\nI tested these protections on each of the WIRED Gear Team's favorite space heaters, roughly knocking heaters over and standing warily by as I swaddled each heater in a cotton sheet atop concrete. Any heater that we recommend performed admirably on these tests, shutting down or modulating its power output to keep from overheating.\nThe statistics bear out the safety improvements to space heaters: The number of fires due to heating equipment in the United States has dropped by more than 40 percent in the years from 2000 to 2020, according to a study by the National Fire Protection Association.\nBut heating devices still reward great caution, as do all devices that pull a lot of energy over long periods. The vast majority of residential heating fires start with actual fire, according to the United States Fire Administration—specifically in fireplaces and fuel burners. But portable space heaters nonetheless accounted for more than a thousand fires in the US each year from 2017 to 2019, according to the USFA's numbers.\nThis accounted for just 3 percent of heating fires overall, but these led to more than 40 percent of fatalities, in part because portable heaters tend to be placed precisely where people live and sleep, and because the resulting fires are far more likely to be unconfined.\nSo treat your space heater with the caution and skepticism that it deserves. Here are some quite simple space heater safety tips, courtesy of the fine federal experts at the USFA, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM).\nObserve the “3-foot rule.” The CSPC has a simple rule of thumb: Keep your space heater at least 3 feet away from anything flammable—pretty much the same amount of space that's considered courteous between two people during polite conversation. Flammable materials includes bedding, drapes, furniture, the dress you were going to wear, stray socks or stockings, your food delivery bag, and that great book you’ve been reading. Generally, also avoid placing flammable stuff like pillows or drapes in a spot that might potentially fall atop the space heater or drape over them.\nBe especially wary of really, really flammable things. Maybe you don't need to be told this. But AHAM recommends that you keep your space heater far, far away from very flammable things like paint, gasoline, aerosols, and books of matches. Heating up things like this with dry air is asking for trouble.\nDon’t leave a space heater unattended. \"Unattended” includes sleeping. I know it's cold out there some nights. I know it feels easier to sleep when you're toasty. But while bedrooms account for a minuscule 4 percent of heating fires, such fires are also disproportionately fatal, according to NFPA statistics—accounting for 22 percent of deaths. If you insist on using a space heater in your bedroom at night, get a device like Vornado's TAV10 ($140) or Dreo's Polaris tower ($130) that has a timed shut-off—and use it, so it doesn’t run all night while you sleep. (Or, might we suggest a wonderful down comforter instead? So warmmmm.) But also, don't leave a space heater running after leaving a room or going to bed: Space heaters left running in the main living room space account for nearly 50 percent of fatal fires, according to the NFPA.\nPlug your heater directly into the outlet. This is a big one that's often overlooked. Do not, basically ever, use extension cords or power strips with space heaters. The added cord length builds up electrical load and can lead to shorts, overheating, and fires. If you must use a longer cord, consult an expert to ensure you get the proper gauge and rating for your space heater.\nUse the thermostat function: OK, most space heater thermostats aren't very accurate (though I do like the idea behind Vornado's Sensa space heater (8/10, WIRED Recommends) with an external temperature sensor). But even if it's off by a few degrees, using the thermostat instead of a temperature blast is good protection against overheating.\nPlace a space heater only on the floor, on a level surface. There’s no particular need to leave a space heater on a table or chair that might be unstable. Heat rises and travels around the room through convection. Don't place your heaters atop thick shag rugs or carpets, either. Tight, short-pile carpets are often safe. If this is your only option, consider models like the Dyson HP07 ($550), which has heating outlets that are farther from the floor.\nDon't put rugs or other objects over the top of your space heater cord: Yes, it's irritating to have the cord out where you can trip on it. But this is another case of making sure you protect the sanctity of the power cord, on devices that use this much power for extended periods. Putting heavy or edged objects atop the cord may damage or pinch it, potentially causing short circuits. Putting a rug on top of a cord will make it more likely that you step on the cord without noticing, thus also potentially damaging the cord. Damaging the cord is bad.\nDon’t plug another appliance into the same outlet or circuit as the space heater. Maybe the worst thing that happens is you trip the circuit breaker. But that’s not fun, either. Most space heaters use 1,500 watts, the highest amount approved for consistent usage on 15-amp circuits.\nDon’t leave a portable heater running unattended in a room with a baby, most sources say. The same advice goes for people with mobility issues. The risk isn’t just fire, but hyperthermia. This can be a delicate balancing act, of course.\nKeep space heaters away from water and even general dankness. Bathrooms are famously dangerous places for high-wattage electrical devices. But also: You know that damp basement? The one that's kinda cold and has puddles sometimes? Not a good place for a space heater.\nRead the manual. Manufacturers have all kinds of good advice, as well as information about each device's safety features and wattage used by the device.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nNada Fadul’s love for science and medicine began early. As a child, the aspiring physician-scientist had observed her father, a doctor, treat patients at his primary care office. Later, as an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, Fadul had the opportunity to work in a lab developing nanotherapies for ovarian cancer. Through these experiences and a strong cadre of mentors, she “felt really inspired to pursue both research and medicine,” she says.\nTo gain more lab experience before applying to joint MD-PhD programs, Fadul had decided to apply to the National Institutes of Health’s postbaccalaureate program, which offers full-time research positions to recent college graduates considering careers in medicine or STEM. But in early February, she received an email stating that the program had been completely paused. “There’s always some changes when the administration changes, but I didn’t expect the changes to hit so close to home and to affect my hopes and plans for the upcoming year,” Fadul says.\nChanged plans, lost opportunities, worries for the future—these are all things that current and prospective scientists across the country now face on a day-to-day basis. Since January, a rapid-fire slurry of executive orders have driven huge cuts to federal funding, hiring freezes, and thousands of layoffs across the research sector, with thousands more job losses expected. For students and graduates, the knock-on effect is a big reduction in opportunities to gain the experience and placements needed to enter and progress in the field.\nDuring the lifespan of a scientist, there are several critical steps. For many, the first is to gain research experience during college—whether through working in a university laboratory or through summer research programs. From there, some take gap years (with the NIH postbaccalaureate program previously a popular option) to pursue even more research. Then comes an application to graduate school, completing graduate school, and possibly doing a postdoctoral fellowship. After all of that, only some end up as research faculty at institutions—where they embark on a decades-long saga of grant applications, many of which are for federal funding from the NIH or National Science Foundation (NSF).\nIt’s a process that already forces young scientists to compete for a limited number of spots at each stage of training. Many, like Fadul, seek out extra research opportunities to ready their applications. The process of simply applying to graduate school is “five to ten years in the making,” says a current post-baccalaureate scholar at the NIH, who requested anonymity due to fear of retribution. “I think that for almost all of the applicants, this is their dream, and this feels like their livelihood.” In the space of two months, it is a career pathway that has rapidly narrowed.\nAfter the administration’s initial memos indicating that a federal funding freeze was imminent in late January, graduate programs across the US began reducing the number of admitted students. To track what exactly was happening, faculty and students began compiling a comprehensive list of universities and their associated program reductions—based on word of mouth and reported evidence. Among many others, this included a 20 percent reduction at MIT’s biology graduate program, an estimated 20 percent reduction at Duke’s biomedical graduate programs, and a 30 percent reduction at UC San Diego’s biological sciences program—from 25 places down to 17.\n“If we went on business-as-usual and admitted a normal class size, then we’d have students we couldn’t support in the program,” says Kimberly Cooper, a developmental biologist at UCSD and associate director of the biology PhD program. One of her undergraduate mentees wasn’t admitted to any graduate programs this year. That mentee hopes to become an unpaid volunteer to continue working in a lab “because she wants to do this so badly,” Cooper adds. “That’s another concern I have—that we may be moving back to a place where research was really only for people that have independent finances to be able to do it.”\nJeremy Berg, a former director of the NIH’s National Institute of General Medical Sciences, has tracked the disbursement of NIH T32 grants—training grants that directly support graduate and postdoctoral research. Since February of this year, only two new T32 grants have been awarded. For comparison, 69 grants were made from February to March of last year. While March is not necessarily the month where T32 grant-awarding peaks, the lack of activity has Berg concerned for the future.\nThe lack of NIH training grants is in line with trends from the NSF, where awards from the Directorate for STEM Education appear to have slowed to a near-complete stop. In comparison to the NIH, the NSF funds research that can be non-biomedical in nature and runs the Graduate Research Fellowship Program—which provides support for thousands of graduate students each year. GRFP awards are usually made in April, and it’s unclear how they will be impacted this year. “It’s a terrible signal to send to students who decided they want a career in science and have been waiting their whole life to go to graduate school,” says Berg.\nThe instability in training-grant disbursement, coupled with the NIH’s new policy on capping indirect costs—which pay for critical functions like lab maintenance, equipment, and administrative support—have not just affected trainees, but also the faculty whose labs rely on graduate students and postdoctoral scholars’ work. Federal grants provide a significant portion of many laboratories’ funding, says Ran Blekhman, a geneticist at the University of Chicago whose lab is almost entirely funded by the NIH. This uncertainty has forced many scientists, particularly those early in their careers, to pivot their focus from simply doing science to trying to make their science—and their careers—survive.\nBlekhman, whose research group studies the human microbiome, has always looked for non-federal sources of funding. But money from, say, private foundations often does not support basic science or has an unsustainably low-indirect-cost ceiling, which ordinarily would have been covered by NIH funding before the new indirect-cost cap. “My feeling is that everybody’s already been looking everywhere,” Blekhman says. “It’s not like there is a new pot of money that no one was aware of.”\nTo keep the lights on in the lab, contingency plans abound. Cooper, who has four NIH proposals in limbo, recently helped one of her postdoctoral scholars apply for a fellowship in Europe to continue her research. Blekhman is thinking about how many students he can reasonably support in the future, should cuts hit his lab.\nEven among the uncertainty, many students remain deeply committed to pursuing careers in science. Robert Schwartz, a college and graduate essay consultant, says that some students he works with are taking a few extra gap years in European laboratories, in the hopes that more US funding will open up in the future. As Fadul figures out which schools to apply to, her list of federally funded MD-PhD programs has gotten shorter, while the list of MD programs (which do not rely as directly on federal funding) has gotten longer. But the uncertainty is “not going to stop me, and I don’t think it’s going to stop my peers, either,” she says.\nIn the meantime, Cooper, Blekhman, and others are focusing on ways to better support and educate their trainees—not only about how federal funding works, but also how to keep going. “We just want people in the lab to do their great science without having existential dread about how they get paid,” Cooper says.",

    "content_text": "The internet is massive. But does it have … actual mass? Big server farms and miles of fiber-optic cables do, of course, but we don’t mean the infrastructure of the internet. We mean the internet itself. The information. The data. The cybernetics. And because storing and moving stuff through cyberspace requires energy—which, per Einstein, has mass—it should, in theory, be possible to calculate the internet’s weight.\nWay back in the adolescent days of the web, in 2006, a Harvard physicist named Russell Seitz made an attempt. His conclusion? If you consider the mass of the energy powering the servers, the internet comes out to roughly 50 grams—or about the weight of a couple strawberries. People still use Seitz’s comparison to this day. We’re all wasting our lives on something we could swallow in one bite!\nBut a lot has happened since 2006—Instagram, iPhones, and the AI boom, to name a few. (By Seitz’s logic, the internet would now weigh as much as a potato.) There’s also the fact that, around the time of Seitz’s calculation, Discover magazine proposed a different method. Information on the internet is written in bits, so what if you looked at the weight of the electrons needed to encode those bits? Using all internet traffic—then estimated to be 40 petabytes—Discover put the internet’s weight at a tiny fraction (5 millionths) of a gram. So, more like a squeeze of strawberry juice. WIRED thought it was time to investigate for ourselves.\nFirst up: the server-energy method. “Fifty grams is just wrong,” says Christopher White, president of NEC Laboratories America and a veteran of storied research powerhouse Bell Labs. Other scientists we spoke to agreed. Daniel Whiteson, a particle physicist at UC Irvine and cohost of the podcast Daniel and Kelly’s Extraordinary Universe, said it’s an overly convenient way to get “the units you want”—like assuming the price of a doughnut could be calculated by dividing the total number of doughnuts in the world by the world GDP. Preposterous! That would give us a doughnut-per-dollar figure, sure, “but it wouldn’t be correct, or even close,” Whiteson says.\nDiscover magazine’s calculation also seemed a little off to us. It has more to do with the transmission of the internet, as opposed to the internet itself. It also assumes a set number of electrons needed to encode information. In reality, the number is incredibly varied and depends on the specific chips and circuits being used.\nWhite suggested a third method. What if we pretend to put all the data stored on the internet, across all the hundreds of millions of servers around the world, in just one place? How much energy would we need to encode that data, and how much would that energy weigh? In 2018, the International Data Corporation estimated that by 2025, the internet’s datasphere would reach 175 zettabytes, or 1.65 x 1024 bits. (1 zettabyte = 10247 bytes and 1 byte = 8 bits.) White suggested multiplying those bits by a mathematical term—kBT ln2, if you’re curious—that captures the minimum energy needed to reset a bit. (Temperature is a factor, because storing data is easier in colder conditions. Meaning: The internet is lighter in space than it is in Tucson, Arizona.) We can then take that number, which will represent energy, and call on E = mc2 to reach the total mass. At room temperature, the entirety of the internet would weigh (1.65 x 1024) x (2.9×10–21)/c2, or 5.32 x 10–14 grams. That’s 53 quadrillionths of a gram.\nWhich … is no fun. Even if it has almost no physical mass, the internet still feels weighty, to those billions of us weighed down by it every day. White, who has previously attempted similar philosophical estimates, clarified that in reality, the web is so intricate that it is “essentially unknowable,” but why not try? In recent years, scientists have floated the idea of storing data within the building blocks of nature: DNA. So what if we were to weigh the internet in those terms? Current estimates say that 1 gram of DNA can encode 215 petabytes—or 215 x 1015 bytes—of information. If the internet is 175 x 10247 bytes, that’s 960,947 grams’ worth of DNA. That’s the same as 10.6 American males. Or one third of a Cybertruck. Or 64,000 strawberries.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

It’s always just about here. Well, is it? Really? Nearly a century ago, Erwin Schrödinger poked fun at quantum principles by comparing them to a cat that’s both alive <em>and</em> dead. Today, quantum computing finds itself in just such a state: a superposition of here and not-here, a series of world-changing breakthroughs that are, at the same time, also colossal letdowns. So what’s the real story? Let’s open the box and find out.</p></div></div></body></html>",

This programmer used AI every day; that programmer wouldn’t touch the stuff. This company paid for AI services; that company banned them. So which is it? Are chatbots liberating human programmers—or programming them right out of their jobs? To find out, we blasted a survey to every software engineer and developer in our orbit, from casual dabblers to career vets. The results amazed and surprised us, capturing an industry at fundamental odds with itself. And did we then upload that data to ChatGPT, just to see what it might make of things? Yes. Yes we did.*\nWill AI Fully Eat Programming Jobs One Day?\nAlmost every coder we surveyed had strong opinions on the matter.

While a small but vocal group insists AI will devour programming jobs in time, most dismiss full automation as a pipe dream. The doom prophets warn that corporate bosses will slash payrolls the moment AI looks capable, leaving human engineers debugging their own obsolescence. The skeptics scoff, arguing AI is more like a hyperefficient intern—useful, but clueless—that can’t handle context, edge cases, or real problem-solving. The realists see AI as a force multiplier, not a job killer—automating repetitive coding but leaving the creativity, architecture, and debugging to humans. “If AI does eat programming,” one put it, “I’ll just switch to debugging AI.”* The real verdict?

    "content_text": "One day soon, at a research lab near Santa Barbara or Seattle or a secret facility in the Chinese mountains, it will begin: the sudden unlocking of the world’s secrets. Your secrets.\nCybersecurity analysts call this Q-Day—the day someone builds a quantum computer that can crack the most widely used forms of encryption. These math problems have kept humanity’s intimate data safe for decades, but on Q-Day, everything could become vulnerable, for everyone: emails, text messages, anonymous posts, location histories, bitcoin wallets, police reports, hospital records, power stations, the entire global financial system.\n“We’re kind of playing Russian roulette,” says Michele Mosca, who coauthored the most recent “Quantum Threat Timeline” report from the Global Risk Institute, which estimates how long we have left. “You’ll probably win if you only play once, but it’s not a good game to play.” When Mosca and his colleagues surveyed cybersecurity experts last year, the forecast was sobering: a one-in-three chance that Q-Day happens before 2035. And the chances it has already happened in secret? Some people I spoke to estimated 15 percent—about the same as you’d get from one spin of the revolver cylinder.\nThe corporate AI wars may have stolen headlines in recent years, but the quantum arms race has been heating up too. Where today’s AI pushes the limits of classical computing—the kind that runs on 0s and 1s—quantum technology represents an altogether different form of computing. By harnessing the spooky mechanics of the subatomic world, it can run on 0s, 1s, or anything in between. This makes quantum computers pretty terrible at, say, storing data but potentially very good at, say, finding the recipe for a futuristic new material (or your email password). The classical machine is doomed to a life of stepwise calculation: Try one set of ingredients, fail, scrap everything, try again. But quantum computers can explore many potential recipes simultaneously.\nSo, naturally, tech giants such as Google, Huawei, IBM, and Microsoft have been chasing quantum’s myriad positive applications—not only for materials science but also communications, drug development, and market analysis. China is plowing vast resources into state-backed efforts, and both the US and the European Union have pledged millions in funding to support homegrown quantum industries. Of course, whoever wins the race won’t just have the next great engine of world-saving innovation. They’ll also have the greatest code-breaking machine in history. So it’s normal to wonder: What kind of Q-Day will humanity get—and is there anything we can do to prepare?\nIf you had a universal picklock, you might tell everyone—or you might keep it hidden in your pocket for as long as you possibly could. From a typical person’s vantage point, maybe Q-Day wouldn’t be recognizable as Q-Day at all. Maybe it would look like a series of strange and apparently unconnected news stories spread out over months or years. London’s energy grid goes down on election day, plunging the city into darkness. A US submarine on a covert mission surfaces to find itself surrounded by enemy ships. Embarrassing material starts to show up online in greater and greater quantities: classified intelligence cables, presidential cover-ups, billionaires’ dick pics. In this scenario, it might be decades before we’re able to pin down exactly when Q-Day actually happened.\nThen again, maybe the holder of the universal picklock prefers the disaster-movie outcome: everything, everywhere, all at once. Destroy the grid. Disable the missile silos. Take down the banking system. Open all the doors and let the secrets out.\nSuppose you ask a classical computer to solve a simple math problem: Break the number 15 into its smallest prime factors. The computer would try all the options one by one and give you a near-instantaneous answer: 3 and 5. If you then ask the computer to factor a number with 1,000 digits, it would tackle the problem in exactly the same way—but the calculation would take millennia. This is the key to a lot of modern cryptography.\nTake RSA encryption, developed in the late 1970s and still used for securing email, websites, and much more. In RSA, you (or your encrypted messaging app of choice) create a private key, which consists of two or more large prime numbers. Those numbers, multiplied together, form part of your public key. When someone wants to send you a message, they use your public key to encrypt it. You’re the only person who knows the original prime numbers, so you’re the only person who can decrypt it. Until, that is, someone else builds a quantum computer that can use its spooky powers of parallel computation to derive the private key from the public one—not in millennia but in minutes. Then the whole system collapses.\nThe algorithm to do this already exists. In 1994, decades before anyone had built a real quantum computer, an AT&T Bell Labs researcher named Peter Shor designed the killer Q-Day app. Shor’s algorithm takes advantage of the fact that quantum computers run not on bits but on qubits. Rather than being locked in a state of 0 or 1, they can exist as both simultaneously—in superposition. When you run an operation on a handful of qubits in a given quantum state, you’re actually running that same operation on those same qubits in all their potential quantum states. With qubits, you’re not confined to trial and error. A quantum computer can explore all potential solutions simultaneously. You’re calculating probability distributions, waves of quantum feedback that pile onto each other and peak at the correct answer. With Shor’s algorithm, carefully designed to amplify certain mathematical patterns, that’s exactly what happens: Large numbers go in one end, factors come out the other.\nIn theory, at least. Qubits are incredibly difficult to build in real life, because the slightest environmental interference can nudge them out of the delicate state of superposition, where they balance like a spinning coin. But Shor’s algorithm ignited interest in the field, and by the 2010s, a number of projects were starting to make progress on building the first qubits. In 2016, perhaps sensing the nascent threat of Q-Day, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to develop quantum-proof encryption algorithms. These largely work by presenting quantum computers with complex multidimensional mazes, called structured lattices, that even they can’t navigate without directions.\nIn 2019, Google’s quantum lab in Santa Barbara claimed that it had achieved “quantum supremacy.” Its 53-qubit chip could complete in just 200 seconds a task that would have taken 100,000 conventional computers about 10,000 years. Google’s latest quantum processor, Willow, has 105 qubits. But to break encryption with Shor’s algorithm, a quantum computer will need thousands or even millions.\nThere are now hundreds of companies trying to build quantum computers using wildly different methods, all geared toward keeping qubits isolated from the environment and under control: superconducting circuits, trapped ions, molecular magnets, carbon nanospheres. While progress on hardware inches forward, computer scientists are refining quantum algorithms, trying to reduce the number of qubits required to run them. Each step brings Q-Day closer.\nThat’s bad news not just for RSA but also for a dizzying array of other systems that will be vulnerable on Q-Day. Security consultant Roger A. Grimes lists some of them in his book Cryptography Apocalypse: the DSA encryption used by many US government agencies until recently, the elliptic-curve cryptography used to secure cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the VPNs that let political activists and porn aficionados browse the web in secrecy, the random number generators that power online casinos, the smartcards that let you tap through locked doors at work, the security on your home Wi-Fi network, the two-factor authentication you use to log in to your email account.\nExperts from one national security agency told me they break the resulting threats down into two broad areas: confidentiality and authentication. In other words, keeping secrets and controlling access to critical systems. Chris Demchak, a former US Army officer who is a professor of cybersecurity at the US Naval War College and spoke with me in a personal capacity, says that a Q-Day computer could let an adversary eavesdrop on classified military data in real time. “It would be very bad if they knew exactly where all of our submarines were,” Demchak says. “It would be very bad if they knew exactly what our satellites are looking at. And it would be very bad if they knew exactly how many missiles we had and their range.” The balance of geopolitical power in, say, the Taiwan Strait could quickly tilt.\nBeyond that real-time threat to confidentiality, there’s also the prospect of “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. Hackers aligned with the Chinese state have reportedly been hoovering up encrypted data for years in hopes of one day having a quantum computer that can crack it. “They wolf up everything,” Demchak told me. (The US almost certainly does this too.) The question then becomes: How long will your sensitive data remain valuable? “There might be some needles in that haystack,” says Brian Mullins, the CEO of Mind Foundry, which helps companies implement quantum technology. Your current credit card details might be irrelevant in 10 years, but your fingerprint won’t be. A list of intelligence assets from the end of the Iraq War might seem useless until one of those assets becomes a prominent politician.\nThe threat to authentication may be even scarier. “Pretty much anything that says a person is who they say they are is underpinned by encryption,” says Deborah Frincke, a computer scientist and national security expert at Sandia National Laboratories. “Some of the most sensitive and valuable infrastructure that we have would be open to somebody coming in and pretending to be the rightful owner and issuing some kind of command: to shut down a network, to influence the energy grid, to create financial disruption by shutting down the stock market.”\nThe exact level of Q-Day chaos will depend on who has access to the first cryptographically relevant quantum computers. If it’s the United States, there will be a “fierce debate” at the highest levels of government, Demchak believes, over whether to release it for scientific purposes or keep it secret and use it for intelligence. “If a private company gets there first, the US will buy it and the Chinese will try to hack it,” she claims. If it’s one of the US tech companies, the government could put it under the strict export controls that now apply to AI chips.\nMost nation-state attacks are on private companies—say, someone trying to break into a defense contractor like Lockheed Martin and steal plans for a next-generation fighter jet. But over time, as quantum computers become more widely available, the focus of the attacks could broaden. The likes of Microsoft and Amazon are already offering researchers access to their primitive quantum devices on the cloud—and big tech companies haven’t always been great at policing who uses their platforms. (The soldier who blew up a Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas early this year queried ChatGPT to help plan the attack.) You could have a bizarre scenario where a cybercriminal uses Amazon’s cloud quantum computing platform to break into Amazon Web Services.\nCybercriminals with access to a quantum computer could use it to go after the same targets more effectively, or take bigger swings: hijacking the SWIFT international payments system to redirect money transfers, or conducting corporate espionage to collect kompromat. The earliest quantum computers probably won’t be able to run Shor’s algorithm that quickly—they might only get one or two keys a day. But combining a quantum computer with an artificial intelligence that can map out an organization’s weakness and highlight which keys to decrypt to cause the most damage could yield devastating results.\nAnd then there’s Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is exquisitely vulnerable to Q-Day. Because each block in the Bitcoin blockchain captures the data from the previous block, Bitcoin cannot be upgraded to post-quantum cryptography, according to Kapil Dhiman, CEO of Quranium, a post-quantum blockchain security company. “The only solution to that seems to be a hard fork—give birth to a new chain and the old chain dies.”\nBut that would require a massive organizational effort. First, 51 percent of Bitcoin node operators would have to agree. Then everyone who holds bitcoin would have to manually move their funds from the old chain to the new one (including the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin developer who controls wallets containing around $100 billion of the cryptocurrency). If Q-Day happens before the hard fork, there’s nothing to stop bitcoin going to zero. “It’s like a time bomb,” says Dhiman.\nThat bomb going off will only be the beginning. When Q-Day becomes public knowledge, either via grim governmental address or cheery big-tech press release, the world will enter the post-quantum age. It will be an era defined by mistrust and panic—the end of digital security as we know it. “And then the scramble begins,” says Demchak.\nAll confidence in the confidentiality of our communications will collapse. Of course, it’s unlikely that everyone’s messages will actually be targeted, but the perception that you could be spied on at any time will change the way we live. And if NIST’s quantum-proof algorithms haven’t rolled out to your devices by that point, you face a real problem—because any attempts to install updates over the cloud will also be suspect. What if that download from Apple isn’t actually from Apple? Can you trust the instructions telling you to transfer your crypto to a new quantum-secure wallet?\nGrimes, the author of Cryptography Apocalypse, predicts enormous disruptions. We might have to revert to Cold War methods of transmitting sensitive data. (It’s rumored that after a major hack in 2011, one contractor purportedly asked its staff to stop using email for six weeks.) Fill a hard drive, lock it in a briefcase, put someone you trust on a plane with the payload handcuffed to their wrist. Or use one-time pads—books of pre-agreed codes to encrypt and decrypt messages. Quantum-secure, but not very scalable. Expect major industries—energy, finance, health care, manufacturing, transportation—to slow to a crawl as companies with sensitive data switch to paper-based methods of doing business and scramble to hire expensive cryptography consultants. There will be a spike in inflation. Most people might just accept the inevitable: a post-privacy society in which any expectation of secrecy evaporates unless you’re talking to someone in person in a secluded area with your phones switched off. Big Quantum is Watching You.\nThe best-case scenario looks something like Y2K, where we have a collective panic, make the necessary upgrades to encryption, and by the time Q-Day rolls around it’s such an anticlimax that it becomes a joke. That outcome may still be possible. Last summer, NIST released its first set of post-quantum encryption standards. One of Joe Biden’s last acts as president was to sign an executive order changing the deadline for government agencies to implement NIST’s algorithms from 2035 to “as soon as practicable.”\nAlready, NIST’s post-quantum cryptography has been rolled out on messaging platforms such as Signal and iMessage. Sources told me that sensitive national security data is probably being locked up in ways that are quantum-secure. But while your email account can easily be Q-proofed over the internet (assuming the update doesn’t come from a quantum imposter!), other things can’t. Public bodies like the UK’s National Health Service are still using hardware and software from the 1990s. “Microsoft is not going to upgrade some of its oldest operating systems to be post-quantum secure,” says Ali El Kaafarani, the CEO of PQShield, a company that makes quantum-resistant hardware. Updates to physical infrastructure can take decades, and some of that infrastructure has vulnerable cryptography in places it can’t be changed: The energy grid, military hardware, and satellites could all be at risk.\nAnd there’s a balance to be struck. Rushing the transition risks introducing vulnerabilities that weren’t there before. “How do you make transitions slow enough that you can be confident and fast enough that you don’t dawdle?” asks Chris Ballance, CEO of Oxford Ionics, a quantum computing company. Some of those vulnerabilities might even be there by design: Memos leaked by Edward Snowden indicate that the NSA may have inserted a backdoor into a pseudorandom number generator that was adopted by NIST in 2006. “Anytime anybody says you should use this particular algorithm and there’s a nation-state behind it, you’ve got to wonder whether there’s a vested interest,” says Rob Young, director of Lancaster University’s Quantum Technology Centre.\nThen again, several people I spoke to pointed out that any nation-state with the financial muscle and technical knowledge to build a quantum device that can run Shor’s algorithm could just as easily compromise the financial system, the energy grid, or an enemy’s security apparatus through conventional methods. Why invent a new computing paradigm when you can just bribe a janitor?\nLong before quantum technology is good enough to break encryption, it will be commercially and scientifically useful enough to tilt the global balance. As researchers solve the engineering challenge of isolating qubits from the environment, they’ll develop exquisitely sensitive quantum sensors that will be able to unmask stealth ships and map hidden bunkers, or give us new insight into the human body. Similarly, pharma companies of the future could use quantum to steal a rival’s inventions—or use it to dream up even better ones. So ultimately the best way to stave off Q-Day may be to share those benefits around: Take the better batteries, the miracle drugs, the far-sighted climate forecasting, and use them to build a quantum utopia of new materials and better lives for everyone. Or—let the scramble begin.\nLet us know what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor at mail@wired.com.",

    "content_text": "Guillaume Verdon stands before me with a new kind of computer chip in his hand—a piece of hardware he believes is so important to the future of humanity that he’s asked me not to reveal our exact location, for fear that his headquarters could become the target of industrial espionage.\nThis much I can tell you: We’re in an office a short drive from Boston, and the chip arrived from the foundry just a few days ago. It sits on a circuit board about the width of a Big Mac. The pinky-nail-sized piece of silicon itself is dotted with an exotic set of components: not the transistors of an ordinary semiconductor, nor the superconducting elements of a quantum chip, but the guts of a radically new paradigm called thermodynamic computing.\nNot unlike its quantum cousin, thermodynamic computing promises to move beyond the binary constraints of 1s and 0s. But while quantum computing sets out—through extreme cryogenic cooling—to minimize the random thermodynamic fluctuations that occur in electronic components, this new paradigm aims to harness those very fluctuations.\nEngineers are chasing both paradigms in a race to accelerate past ordinary silicon chips and satisfy the ravenous demand for processing power in the age of AI. But Verdon—with his startup, Extropic—isn’t just a contestant in that race. He’s also one of the AI era’s most shameless hype men. He is far better known as his online alter ego, Based Beff Jezos, the founding prophet of an ideology called effective accelerationism.\nKnown as “e/acc” for short, effective accelerationism is an irreverent rejection of effective altruism, a movement that has persuaded many technically minded people that the rise of artificial general intelligence—unless it is corralled and made safe—poses an almost certain existential risk to humanity. “EA’s be like: ‘I believe in Leprechauns and the burden of proof is on you to disprove me,’” went one fairly typical Based Beff post from 2022.\nThe AI existential risk movement, he wrote in another post that year, “is an infohazard that causes depression in our most talented and intelligent folks, killing our productive gains towards a greater more prosperous future.” Another frequent target of his mockery is the AI ethics movement, which critiques large language models as riddled with the biases and blind spots of their architects. As Based Beff continued to spread e/acc’s gospel online, it quickly became a rallying cry among some members of the tech elite, with prominent figures like Marc Andreessen and Garry Tan temporarily adding “e/acc” to their X usernames.\nEffective accelerationism is perhaps best seen as the most technical fringe of a broader zeitgeist: a belief that American politics is broken and that caution, overregulation, and woke ideology are holding the country back. That ethos helped propel Donald Trump back to the White House, with Elon Musk, a hero of the e/acc movement, by his side. Like Trump 2.0, effective accelerationism promises an unstoppable American renaissance and an untroubled view of the work needed to get there. In both cases, the details are fuzzy.\nBut under the sharp resolution of a laboratory microscope, the specifics of Verdon’s new chip are, if nothing else, plain to see: an array of square features each a few dozen microns wide. These components, Verdon promises, will be used to generate “programmable randomness”—a chip in which probabilities can be controlled to produce useful computations. When combined with a classical computer, he says, they will provide a highly efficient way to model uncertainty, a key task in all sorts of advanced computing, from modeling the weather and financial markets to artificial intelligence. (Some academic labs have already built prototype thermodynamic hardware, including a simple neural network—the technology at the heart of modern machine learning.)\nWhen we meet at Extropic’s headquarters in early 2025, Verdon, 32, looks more like a contractor than a physicist, wearing a plain Carhartt T-shirt over a broad frame, a pair of angular glasses, and a trim beard over a square jaw. Extropic, he explains, plans to have its first operational chips available for market later in 2025, less than a year after the design was first conceived. “Eventually entire workloads could run on thermo hardware,” Verdon says. “Some day a whole language model could run on it.”\nThe speed, maybe impatience, with which Verdon has developed these thermodynamic “accelerators” is all the more remarkable for another reason. Not long ago his work was synonymous with a completely different futuristic computing paradigm, only it wasn’t moving fast enough for him. Effective altruism and AI safety aren’t all Verdon has noisily repudiated over the past couple of years; he has also rejected quantum computing. “The story of thermodynamic computing is kind of an exodus from quantum,” Verdon says. “And I kind of started that.”\nBack in 2019, when he was still a PhD student at Canada’s University of Waterloo, Verdon was recruited to a team at Google tasked with figuring out how to use quantum computers—fabled machines capable of harnessing quantum mechanics to perform computations at unfathomable speeds—to supercharge artificial intelligence.\nBy early 2022 the team had made important progress. Verdon had led the development of Tensor-Flow Quantum, a version of the company’s AI software designed to run on quantum machines, and the hardware team at Alphabet was working on perfecting quantum error correction for a single qubit—a trick needed to account for the insane instability of quantum states.\nBut while Verdon was busy working at Google, several theoretical discoveries in academia started to suggest that quantum computing would take a lot longer to pay off than originally hoped. Back in 2018, Ewin Tang, then just an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, had published a startling paper showing that one of the best candidates for an exponential speedup in quantum machine learning—a kind of quantum recommendation algorithm—would not offer much acceleration after all. Other papers built upon the discovery and further impugned quantum’s reputation.\nVerdon was not the only person who felt that a quantum bubble was losing air. “It looked like all these applications we really wanted to do weren’t going to work in the era of noisy quantum computing,” says Faris Sbahi, cofounder and CEO of a thermodynamic startup called Normal Computing. “I became a little negative on the prospects for commercial quantum computing, and I switched fields.” Both Normal Computing and Extropic have attracted other refugees from other quantum computing labs and startups. (Verdon says the two companies have different approaches and are not direct rivals.)\nThis quiet quantum bust coincided with the generative AI boom—and with another growing source of frustration for Verdon. Just as ChatGPT was taking off, Verdon felt that the industry’s response was dampened by effective altruists who wanted to freeze progress and subject the technology to needless controls. He saw the tech industry itself consumed by an overly scrupulous, self-critical, woke ideology.\nQuantum dead ends, tech-industry navel-gazing, an AI gold rush: All of these merged together in Verdon’s mind to inspire a new philosophy along with belief in a new engineering idea. In both conventional and quantum computers, heat is a source of errors. Both kinds of computing require huge expenditures of energy to prevent natural thermodynamic effects in electronic circuits from either flipping 1s to 0s or destroying delicate quantum states. Instead of fighting these effects, Verdon thought, why not save all that heat-killing energy and embrace the chaos—in hardware and in life—to make something new?\nIn Lord of Light, a 1967 science fiction novel by Roger Zelazny, the last member of a futuristic revolutionary group known as the accelerationists wants to convince society to embrace unrestrained technological progress. By the 1990s, a British philosopher named Nick Land was advocating for a real accelerationist movement that would unshackle capitalism from the restraints imposed by politicians and welcome the technological and social destruction and renewal this would bring. Accelerationist ideas are echoed by other alt-right thinkers, including the influential blogger Curtis Yarvin, who argues that Western democracy is a bust and ought to be replaced.\nVerdon and his bros, however, see accelerationism through the prism of natural laws. In a founding manifesto, offering a “physics-first view of the principles underlying effective accelerationism,” they cite recent work suggesting that the existence of life itself may be explained by the propensity of matter to harness and exploit energy. Not only does the thermodynamic approach promise a much leaner form of computing, Verdon argues, it also reflects how biological intelligence itself has evolved. He and his e/acc allies argue that the same energy-harnessing principle accounts for the development of social organizations and the very course of humanity.\n“Effective accelerationism aims to follow the ‘will of the universe’: leaning into the thermodynamic bias towards futures with greater and smarter civilizations that are more effective at finding/extracting free energy from the universe and converting it to utility at grander and grander scales,” the manifesto reads. And it doesn’t hold humanity particularly dear: “e/acc has no particular allegiance to the biological substrate for intelligence and life.”\nIn January 2022, while he was still at Google, Verdon decided to create a new X account, to talk shit and air some of his ideas. But he didn’t feel free to do it under his own name. (“My tweets were closely monitored,” he tells me.) So he called himself Based Beff, with a profile picture of a ripped ’80s video game version of Jeff Bezos.\nBased Beff quickly demonstrated a talent for humor, whipping up like-minded, right-leaning tech bros and trolling AI doomers. In July, he linked to an erotic novel about Microsoft’s Clippy—and used it to poke fun at a canonical thought experiment, famous among effective altruists, involving a world-destroying AI that is optimized for making paper clips. “It’s #PrimeDay so I’m buying this for all the anti-AGI EAs,” he wrote. “I found it very freeing,” Verdon says. “It was like a video game persona, and stuff just started pouring out of me.”\nI first spoke to Verdon in December 2023, just after Forbes had used his voiceprint to identify him as the person behind the Based Beff Jezos account. The attention was uncomfortable for someone accustomed to working in relative obscurity. “I was in shock for a while,” Verdon says. “It was traumatic.”\nBut rather than run and hide after being outed, Verdon chose to embrace his newfound celebrity and use it to promote his company. Extropic hurriedly came out of stealth, revealed its vision, and set about recruiting. The company has so far raised $14.1 million in seed funding, and there are around 20 engineers working full-time at the firm. Investors include Garry Tan, Balaji Srinivasan, and two authors of the famous paper “Attention Is All You Need,” which laid out the so-called transformer architecture that has revolutionized AI.\nVerdon is a lot more chill in person than he is when posting as Based Beff Jezos. After I arrive at Extropic, Verdon makes me a very strong espresso before leading me to a windowless hardware lab where a handful of engineers are staring at diagrams of the company’s first chip, fiddling with oscilloscopes that reveal performance characteristics, and staring at code designed to make it sing.\nVerdon introduces me to his CTO and cofounder, Trevor McCourt, a tall, easygoing fellow with shaggy hair who also worked on quantum computing at Alphabet before becoming disillusioned with the project. I ask if McCourt, too, has an online alter ego. “No,” he laughs. “One of me is enough.”\nA couple of weeks earlier, Google had revealed its latest quantum computing chip, called Willow. The chip can now perform quantum error correction on the scale of 105 qubits. For Extropic, this is not a sign that quantum is now on the fast track. Verdon and McCourt point out that the machine still needs to be cooled to extremely low temperatures, and its advantages remain uncertain.\nOnce early adopters get their hands on Extropic’s hardware later this year, the chip may prove its worth with high-tech trading and medical research—both use algorithms that run probabilistic simulations. But in the meantime, the day after we meet, Verdon is on his way to DC for an event timed to Donald Trump’s inauguration. Before boarding his flight, he makes a flurry of posts on X. “I love the techno-capital machine and its creations,” he writes. “We’re accelerating to the stars.”",

    "content_text": "Not every large object in space forms part of a solar system. There are some big objects that exist in isolation in space, without either being a star or orbiting one. One of these, SIMP 0136, wanders aimlessly in the Milky Way, about 20 light years away from Earth. It has a mass about 13 times that of Jupiter, and is thought to have the structure and chemical composition of a giant gas planet, though its true characteristics have not yet been determined.\nSuch untethered objects are typically classified either as “free-floating planets,” which form inside a star system, but are thrown out by the gravitational force of another planet, or as “brown dwarfs,” which form like stars in dense molecular clouds of gas and dust, but lack the mass to undergo stable nuclear fusion like a typical star (for this reason, brown dwarfs are sometimes also known as “failed stars”). It is unclear yet whether SIMP 0136 belongs to either of these categories.\nTo try to find out more about SIMP 0136’s characteristics, a team made up of researchers from Boston University and other institutions recently conducted detailed observations of the mysterious free-floating SIMP 0136 using the James Webb Space Telescope.\nSIMP 0136 was an ideal target for research, for several reasons. Although difficult to observe using visible light, it shines brightly in infrared—in fact, SIMP 0136 is the brightest free-floating planetary-mass object in the northern sky. And because it is free-moving, observations of it aren’t affected by the light of nearby stars. On top of this, its rotation time is very short, about 2 hours and 40 minutes. This allows for efficient global observation of the planet.\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was selected for this work because of its excellent infrared observation capabilities. The team used two instruments that focus on different infrared wavelengths to look at the planet: the telescope’s Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and its Mid Infrared Observatory (MIRI). The team used NIRSpec to observe the object for over three hours, enough to cover the entire planet's rotational period. Then, MIRI was used to observe for another rotation.\nPrevious observations had shown that SIMP 0136’s brightness varies, but the reason for this was unclear. So, the team analyzed new data gathered from the James Webb Space Telescope using an atmospheric model, and found that some wavelengths of infrared light recorded (shown in red in the diagram below) came from a cloud of evaporated iron molecules in the deepest layer of the planet’s atmosphere, while some other infrared wavelengths (shown in yellow below) came from a cloud of silicate mineral particles in the the planet’s upper atmosphere.\nThe unevenness of the state of each cloud layer is thought to be the reason why the brightness of SIMP 0136 changes as it rotates. It’s easy to understand if you think of Jupiter, which as a gas giant planet likely has a similar structure and chemical composition.\nOr for another way to picture this, try imagining the surface of the Earth, says Philip Muirhead of Boston University, a coauthor of a new paper outlining these findings about SIMP 0136. “As the Earth rotates, when the ocean comes into view, you will observe stronger blue colors, and when you observe stronger brown or green colors, it means that continents, forest areas, et cetera come into view,” he explains.\nIn addition, the infrared light shown by the blue lines in the figure above comes from a high layer of SIMP 0136’s atmosphere, far above its cloud layers.\nIt is thought that the brightness of SIMP 0136, caused by these differences in infrared radiation, changes as it rotates because the temperature, like the cloud composition, varies from place to place on the planet. In addition, the researchers noticed hot spots where the planet’s infrared light was particularly bright. They believe that these may be caused by auroras, the existence of which has already been confirmed by radio wave observations.\nHowever, it is difficult to explain all the changes in infrared brightness just by cloud and temperature variations. For this reason, the research team points out that there may be areas in SIMP 0136’s atmosphere where carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are concentrated, and that these areas may also affect the infrared brightness as the planet rotates.\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED Japan and has been translated from Japanese.",

    "content_text": "The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.\nThere are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.\n“There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.\nThe moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”\nTwo European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.\n“We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”\n“It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”\nConcerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.\nDave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.\nSteffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.\nHarry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.\nThe potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.\nWhile there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.\nFor years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.\n“If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can’t properly compete. “We sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,” he says. However, that too could change.\nSchaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “The dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,” Schaake says. “The idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.”",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\">Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://european-alternatives.eu/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://european-alternatives.eu/\" href=\"https://european-alternatives.eu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">European Alternatives</a> website <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu?period=12mo\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu?period=12mo\" href=\"https://plausible.io/european-alternatives.eu?period=12mo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">increased more than 1,200 percent</a>. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered.

There are endless options, but only a few are actually worth your time—and the best rugs will suit your lifestyle. Do you need a low-maintenance rug that can withstand the messiness of pets and kids? Are you a strict no-shoes household? Or are you after something purely decorative, the kind of statement piece no one is allowed to so much as breathe on?\nBeyond aesthetics, there's durability, pile height, and upkeep to think about. Wool rugs are ultra-soft and long-lasting but need TLC. Synthetic blends are easy to clean but might not feel as luxe. Then there's the booming category of machine-washable rugs, which promise convenience without sacrificing style. No matter your needs, I've researched, tested, and rounded up the best rugs for every space. No bad matches here.\nFor more home decor, check out our guides to the Best Couches, Best Bed Frames, and Best Digital Photo Frames.\nHow Big Should an Area Rug Be?\nFinding the right rug size requires factoring in your room's shape, size, and the layout of your furniture. According to West Elm, your living room rug should be large enough to fit at least the front legs of your sofa and main chairs. Leave at least a 1-foot gap between the rug and the walls.\nFor the bedroom, tuck the rug beneath the front two-thirds of your bed, or under the entire bed and nightstands. Alternatively, a runner on each side, or a single one at the foot of the bed works just as well.\nFor the dining room, you'll most likely need a rug that's at least 8 feet wide to accommodate most tables. Opt for a rug that extends at least 2 feet beyond each side of your table, so that it's just enough space for chairs to slide out without getting caught.\nYou don't need a rug in the kitchen, but a runner is a thoughtful touch, particularly if you have an island. Be sure to leave a few inches of space around all sides.\nHallways also love runners; avoid placing any furniture legs on them. Wayfair recommends leaving 6 inches of visible floor space on each side.\nHow I Tested\nTo ensure we're only recommending the best, I tested each rug for at least three months—some for years—under real-world conditions. Here's what I considered:\n- Materials: I put every fiber under the microscope, from cotton and jute to polypropylene, polyester, and everything in between. Synthethic fibers are more affordable but show wear faster, while natural fibers will cost you more but tend to last longer. I made sure to offer options for both synthetic and natural fiber lovers.\n- Textile weave: I've tested a range of flat-woven, low-pile, and high-pile rugs, evaluating how each rug holds up to daily use.\n- Price: Expect a mix of premium and budget-conscious options. In future updates, I'll be adding a few more luxe picks. I also factored in whether a rug pad was an extra expense to consider.\n- Design: From neutral tones to Persian-inspired prints, I left no design unturned. I even included accent rugs and bathmats for those looking to jazz up smaller spaces.\n- Ease of care: I evaluated white glove delivery services, swatch availability, and overall maintenance requirements.\nUpdated June 2025: I've added the Langley Street Fleckenstein Oriental Rug, Rejuvenation Sumaru Hand-Knotted Rug, the Rejuvenation Winnie Indoor/Outdoor Hand-Knotted Rug, and the Revival Bronto Rug as new picks. I've also added the Halesowen Cream/Black Area Rug and the Amada Washable Area Rug as honorable mentions.\nHonorable Mentions\nWayfair Halesowen Cream/Black Area Rug for $114: This adorable rug was my son’s nursery rug. After two years in his room, it’s still just as fluffy and soft as when we first unboxed it. The shedding has also been super minimal for a high-pile rug. It’s a great neutral choice for a kids' room or playroom and is often on sale. —Nena Farrell\nAmada Washable Area Rug ($23 to $170): This low-cost, distressed-pattern area rug from Amada was the first purchase that made my home feel like home after a cross-country move. The quarter-inch low-pile is thin but not overly thin; this combined with an effective non-slip rubber backing means the rug is friendly to stick vacuums as long as you keep it moving. Its polyester faux-wool material is soft under bare feet, if also a bit slick. The material and variegated color saturation make this rug beautifully resistant to a) stains and b) showing stains if they’re there. That said, you can also throw this thing in a washer and shrug. Consider it a splendid gift for the bachelor in your life. —Matthew Korfhage\nUnique Loom Trellis Frieze Collection Area Rug: This is one of those rugs that looks better in product photos than in real life. It's machine-made polypropylene, so it resists stains, shedding, and fading, which is great if you have kids or pets. It lays flat and is easy to vacuum, but it does look and feel cheap. Some Amazon buyers complain about deep creases from it being folded during shipping—I lucked out and got mine rolled, so it flattened quickly. It's smooth underfoot, but don't expect any warmth or plushness.\nUrban Outfitters Minerva Floral Digital Printed Chenille Rug (5' x 7') for $199: Urban Outfitters cycles through trendy rug designs at lightning speed, but there's always a version of this tasseled chenille piece in stock. It's lightweight, low-profile, and works best as a decorative layer or a bedside accent. But because it's so thin, my cats treat it like a slip-and-slide, sending it skidding across the floor. If you don't want to find it bunched up in a corner, anchor it with furniture or a rug pad. The cotton weave is also a magnet for pet hair and an absolute pain to spot-clean. It's also a tad overpriced for what it is, so you're essentially paying for the aesthetic.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

(And I have a lot of rugs!) It’s pure polyester, and the Persian-inspired design looks like it came out of a laser printer upon close examination, but it’s still a vibrant, stylish piece that resists all manner of stains. (It’s labeled as “Performance” on Wayfair’s website.) There was no noticeable off-gassing after it was unwrapped and unfurled. As a bonus, it also lies perfectly flat so isn't a trip hazard, is safe for heated floors, and has endured cat claws, rough vacuuming, and food spills while still looking like it arrived in the mail yesterday.</p><p>In fact, it’s the only rug I own where even the oldest, most crusted-on cat barf can be cleaned with a simple wipe of a damp cloth. No scrubbing or soaking is needed here. I tested the 7'6\" x 9'6\" size, and the bottom was naturally grippy enough that I didn’t feel I needed a rug pad, though one is recommended by the manufacturer. Since this rug is a bit thin, you might want one for more of a cushiony feel, especially if your floors are tile or a similarly hard surface. If the red tones aren’t your style, this pattern also comes in green, charcoal, blue, and multi-toned colorways. <em>—Kat Merck</em></p><table><thead><tr><th>Specs</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Materials</strong></td><td>Polyester</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Textile Technique</strong></td><td>Machine woven</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pile Height</strong></td><td>0.28 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sizes Available</strong></td><td>7'6 by 9'6 feet to 10 by 14 feet</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Colors Available</strong></td><td>Blue/Red/Ivory; but also comes in blue, green, charcoal, brown, and multi-tones</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Care instructions:</strong> Vacuum without a beater brush.

Bluetooth is a ubiquitous wireless connectivity standard that connects our headphones, speakers, smartwatches, and smart rings with our phones; headsets, keyboards, and mice with our laptops; and can even be used to broadcast audio to individuals or large audiences in public places with Auracast.\nIn this Bluetooth guide, I'll briefly explain how it works, review its two-decade history to describe the differences between versions, and examine what’s next for the standard.\nHow Does Bluetooth Work?\nBluetooth enables supported devices to connect wirelessly using high-frequency radio waves. Bluetooth relies on the same 2.4-GHz frequency band as 2.4-GHz Wi-Fi but, thanks to adaptive frequency-hopping (AFH), it avoids crowded frequencies and limits interference. Bluetooth also uses lower power, has less range, and isn't as fast as 2.4-GHz Wi-Fi.\nBluetooth has had its share of vulnerabilities, but it’s not too difficult to stay secure, and the latest versions are far more secure by design. Everyone has encountered Bluetooth pairing problems and annoying glitches—we have a guide to help you fix Bluetooth issues—but it's a robust standard that remains enormously convenient and, consequently, hugely popular. Every version of Bluetooth is backward compatible, meaning a Bluetooth 5.3 device can connect to a Bluetooth 4.0 device. But the features and functionality are always limited by the older device.\nCompanies employ Bluetooth in many proprietary features, like Apple’s AirDrop and Google’s Quick Share. While the U1 chip in Apple devices enables ultra-wideband (UWB) technology to determine the direction of your phone and help you share files with nearby devices, AirDrop uses Bluetooth for the initial discovery process and then switches to Wi-Fi to transmit files. Google merged Nearby Share with Samsung’s Quick Share in 2024, and much like AirDrop, it uses Bluetooth to establish a connection and then Wi-Fi to transfer files.\nThese are just two examples. Google also has a standard called Fast Pair that quickly connects a wireless device with a smartphone, and it uses Bluetooth too.\nHistory of Bluetooth\nBluetooth is named after King Harald “Bluetooth” Gormsson—the logo is a combination of his runes for his initials—who had a literal blue tooth (it was dead). He united Denmark and Norway in 958. This short-range radio technology grew from a 1996 meeting between Intel, Ericsson, and Nokia. The first version didn’t land until 1999, but Bluetooth didn’t take off until a few years later.\nThe standard is managed by a not-for-profit Bluetooth Special Interest Group, or Bluetooth SIG, and it's headquartered in the US. While there are thousands of members, the most influential companies help shape the direction of the standard and include companies like Ericsson, Intel, Nokia, Apple, Microsoft, Lenovo, and Google.\nEvery version brought myriad incremental improvements to make Bluetooth faster, more efficient, more secure, and less buggy, but we’re just going to run through the headline features here.\n- Bluetooth 1.2 in 2003 figured out how to avoid Wi-Fi interference and enabled quicker pairing, helping to popularize the standard.\n- Bluetooth 2.0 in 2004 brought EDR (Enhanced Data Rate), tripling the data rate from 1 to 3 Mbps.\n- Bluetooth 2.1 in 2007 brought SSP (Secure Simple Pairing), enhancing security and reducing power draw.\n- Bluetooth 3.0 + HS (High Speed) in 2009 bumped rates up by initially connecting via Bluetooth and then switching to Wi-Fi.\n- Bluetooth 4.0 LE (Low Energy) landed in 2010 and, as the name suggests, reduced power requirements even further.\n- Bluetooth 4.1 in 2013 allowed Bluetooth devices to communicate with each other.\n- Bluetooth 4.2 boosted data rates and IoT connectivity in 2014.\n- Bluetooth 5 in 2016 increased the potential range massively, going from around 50 meters to well over 200 meters. But range is dependent on the power class, and there are three classes. Class 1 devices have the greatest range and use the most power, Class 2 are limited to around 10 meters, and Class 3 is only 1 meter.\n- Bluetooth 5.1 in 2019 brought faster pairing and better tracking accuracy.\n- Bluetooth 5.2 in 2020 allowed for multiple simultaneous data streams and better control over the power and signal required by connected devices.\n- Bluetooth 5.3 in 2021 brought improvements in audio quality, increased power efficiency, and wider compatibility.\n- Bluetooth 5.4 in 2023 improved security and reduced latency, but it also included functionality aimed at retailers, allowing them to monitor and change electronic shelf labels (ESL). Devices that support ESL are expected to ship in 2027.\n- Bluetooth 6.0 is the latest version, announced in 2024. It includes a precise tracking capability called Channel Sounding that enables two devices to accurately measure the distance between them, alongside various efficiency improvements.\nHow to Use Bluetooth\nOne of the main reasons Bluetooth is so popular is because it's easy to use. You can generally turn Bluetooth on via the settings of your phone or computer and find a menu of available devices to connect with. Sometimes you need to put the device you want to connect with into pairing mode, which may involve holding down a button (refer to the device manufacturer). There's usually a pairing pop-up on one or both devices so you can accept the connection.\nBluetooth support is built into the chipsets of many devices, but if your computer or laptop lacks it, you can always add it via a dongle, like this Asus Bluetooth 5.0 Adapter ($18) or this one from Plugable ($17). If range is an issue, this popular Techkey Bluetooth 5.3 Adapter ($22) includes an antenna to boost it.\nYou can also add Bluetooth functionality to headphones, speakers, or car stereos that lack it with something like the 1Mii Bluetooth 5.3 Music Receiver ($17), but the device must have a 3.5-mm port or jack. We have also tested and like Scosche's Bluetooth Radio Transmitter for cars ($30), which adds Bluetooth connectivity to vehicles without it through the cigarette lighter port.\nWhat’s Next for Bluetooth?\nThe most exciting new feature on the horizon for Bluetooth is Auracast. Announced by the Bluetooth (SIG) in 2022, the idea is that you will be able to broadcast and join audio streams in public places by selecting a stream from a list (as you currently do to join a Wi-Fi network), by scanning a QR code, or by tapping where you see an Auracast logo.\nAuracast will allow several people to connect to the same audio stream simultaneously and could be used to watch a movie together on a smartphone in the back of the car, get audio from TVs in public spaces like the gym, or enhance accessibility for the deaf and hard of hearing who could stream audio directly to their hearing aids at a public concert.\nThe catch is that devices must support Bluetooth 5.2 or later and the Public Broadcast Profile (PBP) to receive Auracast streams. It will likely take a while for devices with transmitter capabilities to roll out, though we may see plug-ins to enable this in the short term. Venue adoption is another piece of the puzzle, as they will have to deploy Auracast broadcast transmitters, so it may be a few years before this is widely available.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

    "content_text": "Amid the flurry of Apple Intelligence features pushed out to iPhones, iPads, and Macs in recent months, AI-powered art generation hasn't been forgotten. Apple has debuted a new AI art maker called Image Playground, ready and waiting to turn your text prompts into pictures.\nIf you're running iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, or macOS Sequoia 15.2, you'll find Image Playground on your device as a preinstalled app. You can use it for everything from backgrounds for digital invites to cartoon depictions of your friends and relatives.\nIf you can describe it, Image Playground can make it—and here's how to get started. These instructions are based on the app as it appears on iOS, but the versions on iPadOS and macOS work in a very similar way.\nNote that Apple Intelligence needs to be activated on your device for Image Playground to be accessible. It should be enabled by default, but you can check via the Apple Intelligence & Siri menu in Settings (iOS and iPadOS) or System Settings (macOS).\nCreating New Images\nOpen up the Image Playground app, and you'll see a few suggestions for starting points: themes like Birthday and Adventure, and places like City and Mountains. You can tap on any of these suggestion shortcuts without entering a text prompt, and the app will come up with something that matches after a few seconds.\nAlternatively, describe what you want to see using the input box at the bottom. This can be anything you want, from “an eagle gliding over the beach in the sunshine” to “a professor hunched over a science experiment in the dark.” Tap the arrow to the side of the text box, and Image Playground gets to work.\nThere's another option for a starting point: Down in the lower right corner of the interface, you can tap the + (plus) button to choose a photo from your phone's gallery, or take a new photo with the camera.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThere’s something uniquely exhilarating about the experience of seeing a live TV show taping or exclusive movie screening; the gripping performances, the communal camaraderie of the crowd, and the delectable smugness that comes from previewing a new piece of entertainment before the general public gets to see it.\nIt certainly doesn’t hurt that the tickets to these live tapings and early screenings are usually free. And while the competition to score those free tickets can be classified as its own extreme sport, the payoff can leave you feeling like an X-Games medal winner.\nAs you can imagine, securing these coveted passes isn’t always as simple as clicking a link. Others are vying for the same tickets, so you need yogi-level patience—or Divine Intervention—to acquire a promo code.\n“I don’t mind putting in the work for a free ticket,” says Desmond Jonas, a tall, Afro-wearing 38-year-old catering coordinator from Park Slope. “It’s fun. Movies are my passion, so I try to see as many as I can. And I save money, so it’s a double win.”\nMy first encounter with the free-screening subculture occurred when I was living on a budget in Austin. At a time when I couldn’t always afford to go out, the many available free test screenings kept my social calendar full. News of the screenings came anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of weeks ahead of schedule, so I would stalk AdvanceScreenings.com several times daily to see whenever new promo codes were posted. I’d then head over to Gofobo, where I would enter the code and be granted a free pass to the premiere. The entire process kept me entertained, offering a way to see new films without spending money I didn’t have. Later, when I moved to San Francisco and was going through a rough patch, those same viewings gave me something to look forward to.\nWhere to Find Free Tickets\nThe key to scoring free passes is knowing where to look. Here are the top sites and platforms (some require logins):\n1iota: The fan platform distributes free passes to sitcoms, talk shows, red carpet events, and exclusive fan experiences in New York, California, and select cities elsewhere. Members create an account and submit requests for each individual event they wish to attend. Lucky winners receive a confirmation email link to accept their tickets, which are distributed on the site.\nAdvanceScreenings: Founded in 2009, the largest free-ticket and promotional-code distributor collects and displays aggregate information about viewings in big cities and small towns from an array of sources. Visitors use these links and promo codes to unlock reserved tickets they can use to attend the premiere.\nAmazon Studios: A burgeoning player in film and television, the site regularly hosts free television and movie screenings to generate buzz for new and upcoming projects.\nGofobo: This filmgoer-friendly resource offers tickets to advance screenings of upcoming films, as well as various themed sweepstakes giveaways like promotional movie swag and snack baskets. Users create their own account, which they will use to scan for screenings in or near their Zip code. The account also keeps track of their ticket requests.\nInstagram/X/Eventbrite: Social sites are a great place to learn about online and in-person film screenings held by local organizations as well as major studios. You can follow the major film studios, local movie theaters, and radio stations on social media for a jump on the competition. You’ll need to sift through the immense array of free events for something that resonates with your particular tastes, but there are hidden gems to be found if you’re willing to dig. You can search for an upcoming film by name, or you can search “free screenings Montana,” for example, to find viewings near you.\nMovie Screenings (Facebook Group): Members from around the US share promotional codes, links, and strategies in this open Facebook group.\nSaturday Night Live Reservations: The Mount Everest of them all, SNL, is still going strong in its golden years. The show has a yearly sweepstakes where prospective visitors submit their email during the month of August for free passes to a specific episode. The website also is home to a weekly lottery for standby tickets. Each Thursday at 10:00 am, the SNL crew releases tickets for that weekend’s dress rehearsal and live show. Competition is intense, and seats fill up faster than the time it takes to ride the elevator from the 30 Rock lobby up to Studio 8H.\nWarner Bros. Studios: The studio-sponsored site allows visitors to enter a promotional code from all the channels by which the codes are distributed—through the studio, from movie theaters, via local TV and radio stations, or at AdvanceScreenings.com—to unlock free ticket vouchers to a variety of WB television and movie offerings.\nHelpful Hints\nBe persistent, be early. Most ticketing platforms operate on a first-come, first-served basis, so apply for admission ASAP. Set alerts and check for new releases several times daily, especially for AdvanceScreenings.com. Once you get your free ticket, be sure to show up at the venue early. Events are often overbooked by the promoters to ensure a full house, so don’t get stuck at the back of the line.\nFlexibility helps. Popular shows and films fill up quickly. If you’re open to lesser-known events, you’ll have a better shot at securing a spot.\nSome waiting required. Even after getting in, expect to wait for possible production delays. For high-demand events, arriving hours early is key. Prepare by bringing snacks and wearing comfy shoes.\nKnow the etiquette. Each event has its own set of rules regarding age restrictions, mobile device use, and dress codes. Even if the invitation doesn’t offer implicit guidance, dressing well (business casual) enhances the experience. And, if you’re at a TV taping, it could get you a better seat.\nBe kind to the event staff. These people work hard to give you the best experience possible, so follow their instructions and help make their lives easier. Today’s ticket collector could be tomorrow’s shot-caller with the power to grant you VIP seats.\nThe Ultimate Challenge: Saturday Night Live Standby Tickets\nFor the true die-hards, securing SNL standby tickets is an endurance test. At 10:00 am on Thursdays, fans flock to the NBC website to vie for seats to the dress rehearsal on Saturday evening, and the live show at 11:30 pm Saturday night. Then, they enter contact information, and successful visitors are assigned a numeric position in line. Hopefuls for the dress rehearsal start lining up on 50th between Fifth & Sixth Avenues at 6:00 pm Friday. (For the live show, we lined up at 49th Street & Sixth Avenue.) By 7:00 pm, they begin counting those the current queue to determine the permanent numeric order of the tickets. At exactly 12:01 am Saturday, numbered standby tickets are handed out—but even then these are just standby tickets, so whether or not you’ll actually get in depends on how many ticketed guests show up.\nAfter trying for months, I was one of the lucky one-hundred-or-so site visitors to be assigned a number (#85) for the live show. That Friday, I got in line six hours early with ambivalence and a collapsible camping chair, unsure whether I would be given a physical ticket. I was also unsure whether I would last in the frigid 30-degree December weather.\nAt several points during my vigil, I questioned whether I’d make it. But my line-mates helped talk me through the toughest moments. “You’ve put in too much time to quit now, Lawrence. You can do this,” counseled Kelly, my 19-year-old Economics major buddy from Fordham University. Rob and Daphne, a fortysomething couple visiting from Houston, held my place in line while I took bathroom breaks, and Becky and Christina, both NYU students in their early 20s, brought back hand warmers when I held their place for them.\nThe clock struck 12:01, and a staff member handed me a card (#51—meaning 34 people had not shown up to claim their spot in line) for the live show. And I got in! The show was fantastic: Chris Rock hosted and Gracie Abrams was the musical guest. We were even treated to a surprise appearance by Adam Sandler!\n“This was so epic,” Becky exclaimed at the end of the broadcast. “I got a little confused between watching the monitor and the stage, because I’m used to viewing it [SNL] on a TV. But tonight, I didn’t need one!”\nWhy People Keep Coming Back\nTrudy, a 62-year-old retiree with a pink pixie cut and crimson cat-shaped frames visiting from Portland, summed it up perfectly: “I love being an insider. How many people can say they made eye contact with Adam Sandler? He even waved back!”\nTrudy’s right—there’s definitely something powerful about these moments. When I went to a taping of The Tamron Hall Show, I wasn’t expecting much more than a fun afternoon. But at the end, Tamron actually took my phone and snapped a selfie with me. It’s those unexpected, one-of-a-kind interactions that make all the effort worth it.\nWhether it’s locking eyes with a comedy legend or getting a surprise selfie with a TV host, these experiences remind you why chasing free tickets isn’t just about saving money—it’s about walking away with a story no one else can tell.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nMy ears always perk up a bit when I run across something original for the kitchen. An internal thought process goes from something like there's probably a good reason why no one has ever done this before to how has no one ever done this before?\nDevices that allow you to do a bit of smoking while indoors pop up every few years, and often end up being a bit too impractical to make many waves, or fun but very niche.\nIt’s easy to understand why manufacturers try. From nuts to cheese to ribs and brisket, people go nuts for smoked food. Moving things indoors does really practical things like letting those same people come in from the rain or snow on a cold day. Unfortunately, some indoor smokers can set your smoke alarm off with relationship-damaging frequency. Others simply don’t work very well.\nThose very thoughts ran through my brain when I heard about a new electric indoor smoker from GE Profile which I called in to test. Should we be smoking indoors? This oven had just enough promise to make me wonder if it might be worth one more try.\nThe first thing I discovered is that the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker (aka The Smart Indoor Pellet Smoker) is a honker at 16.25 inches high by 16.5 wide and 20.35 deep. It was easily the largest appliance on my kitchen counter, about twice the size of my microwave, Sparky Jr., whose spot it took. (Sparky took its temporary placement on top of the cooler like a champ.)\nOpening the door reveals a cavity roughly a foot deep, a foot high, and eight inches wide. Small for a built-in oven, very small for a smoker, but hey, it's in my kitchen and not out on my cold, wet deck in Seattle. You feed standard barbecue wood pellets into a little hopper on the top, they drop into the interior and get toasty, then fall into a metal \"waste bin\" that's half filled with water, ensuring they are properly extinguished. There's a well laid out control panel on the front. A not-too-fussy mobile app gives you a degree of remote control if you want that. The temperature range of the smoker is 175 to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, a bit too low to allow it to pinch hit as a (non-smoking) countertop oven, which would be nice. It’s also important to state up-front that it retails for $1,000, though the price fluctuates a lot and has dipped as low as $500 at times.\nI started by making wings from the When Southern Women Cook cookbook, because wings are fun and the book is fantastic. After coating a couple pounds of them in spices, I learned more about how the smoker works. The appliance’s tall and narrow design means you place the food directly on the interior racks, the juices falling into a drip pan at the bottom. On an outdoor smoker or grill, you cook food right on the grates, but in an oven, you almost never cook right on the rack, so this felt peculiar, but not necessarily bad. To keep that grill-versus-oven comparison rolling for a moment, I also liked the ability to simply set the GE to a temperature just like an oven. How civilized! The wings were delicious, if not terribly smoky, and cleaning up wasn't too bad; I just wiped the racks and drip tray down and popped them into the dishwasher.\nNext, I smoked some salmon, realizing that inch-wide portions I made weren't going to fly on the rack, so I set them on parchment paper. This taught me to to start with the racks outside the oven, load them up, then put them in once it's preheated. Really, you'll want to buy three eighth-sheet pans and racks so you don't have to fuss with the oven racks. The salmon came out well.\nRight off the bat, it was an exceedingly convenient way to smoke food, with no fire to build, maintain, or fuss over. It's kind of like a bulky low-temp countertop oven with special powers that allow you to do other things while it does its thing. One night I felt like putting a smoky spin on a favorite cannellini bean dip, and I could try it out without building a fire and babysitting the whole process. I pretty much just put the beans in, hit start, and walked away.\nI was finding, however, that the food coming out of this smoker wasn't all that smoky, even when the device was maxed out on the highest smokiness setting. Perhaps related, I'd often find that it gave the food more the smell of smoke than the taste. I also consistently noticed that a near majority of the pellets that accumulated in the waste bin were not burned, or at least not very. The machine didn’t seem to gobble them up too quickly, but it certainly seemed wasteful considering how few of them were a dark enough color to have been able to emit appreciable smoke.\nStill! I kinda liked it. I could be lazy, still smoke some food, and get a nice dinner out of it. I didn't have to go outside, lug the whole grill kit out to the deck, remove the wet cover from the grill, and stand outside in the rain. I could just hit a button in my kitchen and do other things while it cooked.\nLater, I seared a yogurt-marinated pork loin on my stove, and finished it in the smoker, roughly guided by a recipe from Vishwesh Bhatt's fantastic 2022 cookbook I Am From Here to excellent effect, getting a nice sear in my cast-iron before transferring to a low temperature smoker where it could coast to a finish and pick up some pleasant smokiness.\nThe biggest piece of food I cooked in it was the last one, a 3.5-pound pork butt for pulled pork sandwiches. Following an America’s Test Kitchen recipe I brined the butt in a salt and sugar solution for hours in my fridge before coating it with yellow mustard, black pepper, and paprika. I left liquid smoke out of the brine to better assess how much smokiness was imparted by the smoker.\nFor reasons that probably revolve around making sure the pork finishes in a timely manner and avoiding the internal temperature plateau known as \"the stall,\" the GE Profile's recipe has you wrap the pork in foil once it hits 160 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a peculiar way to finish cooking a pork butt as it robs the cut of a crispy bark (exterior), but that's probably OK in a setup like this which is not designed for smoking perfection but for scratching the itch when you can't or don't want to smoke outdoors.\nAfter a long cook like this, I was curious to note how my house smelled. I'd heard reports of the GE being a bit too smoky smelling to use indoors, but the catalyzer it uses works well enough that there was only what you might call an “appetizing but not overpowering aroma” in the house.\nSpace is the key with setups like these and here is where we run into trouble, particularly revolving around where to put something like this. Unless your kitchen is enormous and you have more countertop acreage than you know what to do with, it feels like the best place for this would be on a garage shelf. (If I stuck the oven out there, though, I'd probably want it to be larger.)\nIn my 1,200 square-foot townhouse, which has no garage, I can't puzzle it out. It's fine on the countertop until I remember my microwave has been displaced, and Sparky Jr.'s having none of that, at which point the smoker gets the boot.\nEven with something as innovative as this indoor smoker, smoking indoors might still be a little too impractical for most people. This one in particular isn’t too niche, it’s just too big for a lot of home kitchens.\nIf, however, you've read all of this, considered its limitations, and have between 500 and 1,000 clams to spend on it and think, I've got space for that, go for it. The rest of us, though, might just want to wait until the weather gets a little warmer.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nThe original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nIn 2003, a German graduate student named Britta Späth encountered the McKay conjecture, one of the biggest open problems in the mathematical realm known as group theory. At first her goals were relatively modest: She hoped to prove a theorem or two that would make incremental progress on the problem, as many other mathematicians had done before her. But over the years, she was drawn back to it, again and again. Whenever she tried to focus on something else, she said, “it didn’t connect.”\nThere was a risk that such a single-minded pursuit of so difficult a problem could hurt her academic career, but Späth dedicated all her time to it anyway. It brought her to the office of Marc Cabanes, a mathematician now at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris who, inspired by her efforts, became consumed by the conjecture, too. While working together, the pair fell in love and eventually started a family.\nThe problem that absorbed them takes a key theme in mathematics and turns it into a concrete tool for group theorists. Math is full of enormously complicated abstract objects that are impossible to study in their entirety. But often, mathematicians have discovered, it’s enough to look at a small fragment of such an object to understand its broader properties. In the third century BC, for instance, the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes estimated the circumference of the Earth—roughly 25,000 miles—by measuring shadows cast by the sun in just two cities about 500 miles apart. Similarly, when mathematicians want to understand an impossibly convoluted function, they might only need to look at how it behaves for a small subset of possible inputs. That can be enough to tell them what the function does for all possible inputs.\nThe McKay conjecture is another example of this principle. It says that if you want to formulate a thorough description of a group—an important mathematical entity that can get prohibitively difficult to study—you only need to look at a tiny piece of it.\nAfter the conjecture was posed in the 1970s, dozens of mathematicians tried their hand at proving it. They made partial progress—and in the process they learned a great deal about groups, which are abstract objects that describe the various symmetries of a mathematical system. But a full proof seemed out of reach.\nThen Späth came along. Now, 20 years after she first learned about the problem and more than a decade after she met Cabanes, the two mathematicians have finally completed the proof.\nWhen the couple announced their result, their colleagues were in awe. “I wanted there to be parades,” said Persi Diaconis of Stanford University. “Years of hard, hard, hard work, and she did it, they did it.”\nThe Power of Primes\nThe McKay conjecture began with the observation of a strange coincidence.\nJohn McKay—described by one friend as “brilliant, soft-spoken, and charmingly disorganized”—was known for his ability to spot numerical patterns in unexpected places. The Concordia University mathematician is perhaps most famous for his “monstrous moonshine” conjecture, which was proved in 1992 and established a deep connection between the so-called monster group and a special function from number theory.\nBefore his death a few years ago, McKay unearthed lots of other important connections, too, many involving groups. A group is a set of elements combined with a rule for how those elements relate to one another. It can be thought of as a collection of symmetries—transformations that leave a shape, a function or some other mathematical object unchanged in specific ways. For all their abstraction, groups are immensely useful, and they play a central role in mathematics.\nIn 1972, McKay was focused on finite groups—groups that have a finite number of elements. He observed that in many cases, you can deduce important information about a finite group by looking at a very small subset of its elements. In particular, McKay looked at elements that form a special, smaller group—called a Sylow normalizer—inside the original group.\nImagine you have a group with 72 elements. This alone doesn’t tell you much: There are 50 different groups of that size. But 72 can also be written as a product of prime numbers, 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3—that is, as 23 × 32. (Generally, the more distinct primes you need to describe the size of your group, the more complicated your group is.) You can decompose your group into smaller subgroups based on these primes. In this case, for instance, you could look at subgroups with eight (23) elements and subgroups with nine (32) elements. By studying those subgroups, you can learn more about the structure of your overall group—what other building blocks the group is composed of, for instance.\nNow take one of those subgroups and add a few particular elements to it to create a special subgroup, the Sylow normalizer. In your 72-element group, you can build a different Sylow normalizer for each eight-element and nine-element subgroup—these are the 2-Sylow normalizers and 3-Sylow normalizers, respectively.\nSylow normalizers, like the subgroups they’re built out of, can tell mathematicians a lot about the original group. But McKay hypothesized that this connection was far stronger than anyone had imagined. It wasn’t just that a Sylow normalizer could give insights into a finite group’s overall structure. He asserted that if mathematicians wanted to compute a crucial quantity that would help them characterize their group, they’d just have to look at one of a particular set of Sylow normalizers: The Sylow normalizer would be characterized by the exact same number.\nThis quantity counts the number of “representations” of a certain type—ways you can rewrite elements of the group using arrays of numbers called matrices. Such a tally might seem arbitrary, but it gives mathematicians a sense of how the group’s elements relate to each other, and it is involved in calculations of other important properties.\nThere seemed to be no good reason why McKay’s quantity should always be the same for a finite group and its Sylow normalizers. A Sylow normalizer might contain just a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the number of elements in the larger group. Moreover, the Sylow normalizer often has a very different structure.\nIt would be as if “in every US election, you count the votes in general, and in this little town in Montana, they are exactly the same proportionally,” said Gabriel Navarro of the University of Valencia. “Not similar, not more or less. Exactly the same.”\nBut that’s what McKay conjectured—for all finite groups. If true, it would make mathematicians’ lives much easier: Sylow normalizers are much easier to work with than their parent groups. It would also hint at the presence of a deeper mathematical truth, one that mathematicians don’t yet have a handle on.\nA year after McKay first observed the coincidence, a mathematician named Marty Isaacs proved that it held for a large class of groups. But then mathematicians got stuck. They were able to show that it held up for one specific group or another, but there were still infinitely many groups left to tackle.\nProving the full conjecture seemed prohibitively difficult. As it turned out, the next major advance on the problem would require the completion of one of the most herculean mathematical projects in history.\nOne Giant Leap for Group Theory, One Small Step for McKay\nThe project—an effort to classify all the building blocks of finite groups—ultimately required thousands of proofs and took more than 100 years to complete. But in 2004, mathematicians finally succeeded in showing that all the building blocks must fall into one of three categories, or else belong to a list of 26 outliers.\nMathematicians had long suspected that, once complete, this classification would help simplify problems such as the McKay conjecture. Maybe they didn’t have to prove the conjecture for all finite groups. Maybe they only had to prove an alternative statement covering the 29 types of building blocks—or for some related set of straightforward groups—that would automatically imply the full McKay conjecture.\nBut first, someone had to show that this strategy would actually work. The very year that the classification was officially completed, Isaacs, Navarro, and Gunter Malle figured out the right way to reframe the McKay conjecture so that they only had to focus on a narrow set of groups.\nFor each group in this new set, they’d have to show something a bit stronger than what McKay had proposed: Not only would the number of representations have to be the same for both the group and the Sylow normalizer, but those representations would have to relate to each other according to certain rules. Isaacs, Navarro, and Malle showed that if this stronger statement held for these particular groups, then the McKay conjecture had to be true for every finite group. (“This was during the Euro 2004,” Navarro recalled. His coauthors “didn’t know that I was sneaking off sometimes to see some games. But important things are important things.”)\nThe trio’s reformulation of the problem was a major breakthrough. Within a few years, mathematicians had used it to resolve most cases of the McKay conjecture. Moreover, it helped them simplify related questions that also involved using one part of an object to study the whole. “Tons and tons of conjectures have now been reduced using this as a blueprint,” said Mandi Schaeffer Fry, a mathematician at the University of Denver.\nBut there was one class of groups—“groups of Lie type”—for which the new version of the McKay conjecture remained open. The representations of these groups were particularly difficult to study, and it was challenging to prove that the relationships among them satisfied the conditions that Isaacs, Navarro, and Malle had outlined.\nBut one of Malle’s graduate students was on the case. Britta Späth.\n“Our Obsession”\nIn 2003, Späth arrived at the University of Kassel to start her doctorate with Malle. She was almost perfectly suited for working on the McKay conjecture: Even in high school, she could spend days or weeks on a single problem. She particularly reveled in ones that tested her endurance, and she fondly recalls long hours spent searching for “tricks that are, in a way, not even so deep.”\nSpäth spent her time studying group representations as deeply as she could. After she completed her graduate degree, she decided to use that expertise to continue chipping away at the McKay conjecture. “She has this crazy, really good intuition,” said Schaeffer Fry, her friend and collaborator. “She’s able to see it’s going to be like this.”\nA few years later, in 2010, Späth started working at Paris Cité University, where she met Cabanes. He was an expert in the narrower set of groups at the center of the reformulated version of the McKay conjecture, and Späth often went to his office to ask him questions. Cabanes was “always protesting, ‘Those groups are complicated, my God,’” he recalled. Despite his initial hesitancy, he too eventually grew enamored with the problem. It became “our obsession,” he said.\nThere are four categories of Lie-type groups. Together, Späth and Cabanes started proving the conjecture for each of those categories, and they reported several major results over the next decade.\nTheir work led them to develop a deep understanding of groups of Lie type. Although these groups are the most common building blocks of other groups, and therefore of great mathematical interest, their representations are incredibly difficult to study. Cabanes and Späth often had to rely on opaque theories from disparate areas of math. But in digging those theories up, they provided some of the best characterizations yet of these important groups.\nAs they did so, they started dating and went on to have two children. (They eventually settled down together in Germany, where they enjoy working together at one of the three whiteboards in their home.)\nBy 2018, they had just one category of Lie-type groups left. Once that was done, they would have proved the McKay conjecture.\nThat final case took them six more years.\nA “Spectacular Achievement”\nThe fourth kind of Lie group “had so many difficulties, so many bad surprises,” Späth said. (It didn’t help that in 2020, the pandemic kept their two young children home from school, making it difficult for them to work.) But gradually, she and Cabanes managed to show that the number of representations for these groups matched those of their Sylow normalizers—and that the way the representations matched up satisfied the necessary rules. The last case was done. It followed automatically that the McKay conjecture was true.\nIn October 2023, they finally felt confident enough in their proof to announce it to a room of more than 100 mathematicians. A year later, they posted it online for the rest of the community to digest. “It’s an absolutely spectacular achievement,” said Radha Kessar of the University of Manchester.\nMathematicians can now confidently study important properties of groups by looking at their Sylow normalizers alone—a much easier approach to making sense of these abstract entities, and one that might have practical applications. And in the process of establishing this connection, Navarro said, the researchers developed “beautiful, wonderful, deep mathematics.”\nOther mathematicians now hope to explore the even deeper conceptual reason why the strange coincidence McKay uncovered is true. Although Späth and Cabanes have proved it, mathematicians still don’t understand why a comparatively tiny set is enough to tell you so much about its larger parent group.\n“There has to be some structural reason why these numbers are the same,” Kessar said.\nSome mathematicians have done preliminary work to try to understand this connection, but so far it remains a mystery.\nSpäth and Cabanes are moving on, each searching for their next obsession. So far, according to Späth, nothing has consumed her like the McKay conjecture. “If you have done one big thing, then it’s difficult to find the courage, the excitement for the next,” she said. “It was such a fight sometimes. It also gave you, every day, a purpose.”\nOriginal story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.",

    "content_text": "Apple Intelligence is fast becoming a disaster.\nAnnounced in June 2024 at Apple's World Wide Developer Conference, the artificial intelligence system arrived on the whole iPhone 16 family in October (and iPhone 15 Pro handsets, too), bringing things like generative tools for folks who can’t be bothered to write emails, and summaries for those who can't be bothered to read, well, just about anything. December’s addition, Genmoji—an AI emoji generator—didn't exactly bring much by way of excitement either.\nAt the heart of the Apple Intelligence we were actually promised is a new Siri, an upgraded version of Apple's voice assistant, enhanced with some of the same smarts that made ChatGPT so beguiling at its launch in 2022. Amazon made similar moves recently with its upgrade to Alexa+, but a more intelligent Siri is still MIA.\nIt was meant to be here already. After initially postponing the full rollout from April to May this year, Apple has now had to delay its launch indefinitely. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, Siri simply doesn’t work properly, and by the time Apple’s marketing department started pitching Apple Intelligence’s upgrades to the iPhone-buying public last year, it was little more than a “barely working prototype.” An iPhone 16 feature is becoming an iPhone 17 one, if we’re lucky.\nIt might seem unfathomable that a multitrillion dollar company could allow its promises to so far outstrip its deliverables. But when you look back, this story echoes throughout the life of Siri so far.\nBig Promises\nIn October 2011 Apple first introduced us to Siri as a core feature of the iPhone 4S. This was years before the first Amazon Echo in 2014, and was only the day before the death of Steve Jobs, who had resigned as CEO less than two months prior.\nThis Siri announcement was accompanied by a promo video of the assistant in use, depicting what seemed like a slice of tech magic.\nSure, Siri’s voice sounds stilted by today’s standards, and iOS 5’s visual style looks almost Victorian to 2025 eyes. But that breezy sense of talking to a digital assistant casually, with no attention paid to your wording—and getting just what you want, complete with context? We’re still not there 13 years later. The original Siri was, at least partly, an illusion.\nThe hope had been that Apple would finally make good on those early promises with the next major release of Apple Intelligence, which apparently infuses Siri with more of the smarts we’ve come to associate with chatbots. Apple says Siri will be “equipped with awareness of your personal context, the ability to take action in and across apps, and product knowledge about your devices’ features and settings.”\nIt’s no less than the “start of a new era,” apparently.\nBut it is also unavoidably reminiscent of the gulf of expectations and realities that typified the original Siri. Those who can cast their minds back to the 2011 launch of Siri may also know it arrived as a standalone iPhone app in 2010. It was originally not part of Apple at all.\nSiri was a project spun up by SRI International, originally known as Stanford Research Institute, and DARPA. That’s a research agency of the U.S. Department of Defense.\nSiri was spun-off into its own company before being acquired by Apple, reportedly for somewhere north of $200 million, just a few months after it launched as an iOS app. You can still see that original app version of Siri running on YouTube.\n“I’d like a romantic place for Italian food near my office,” Siri cofounder Tom Gruber asks the antiquated Siri app, before using it to make a booking—with another voice prompt—all within the app. Once again, it’s an AI assistant goal we’ve still not quite reached all these years later. Hello Google Duplex.\nStill, Apple was entranced by the possibilities, as was then-CEO Steve Jobs. “This was Steve's last deal,” Siri cofounder Tom Gruber told WIRED. “He was personally involved in all stages of the deal, negotiating the deal and following through, making sure that we were successful at Apple after they bought us.”\nHowever, other Apple execs who were around at the time paint the picture of a very flawed digital assistant that was never really up to the job that Apple sold us. Early Siri worked, but only within highly limited functional silos.\n“What we acquired was a demo that would work great for a couple of people but wouldn’t scale to our user base … there was a lot of smoke and mirrors behind the original Siri implementation,” former Apple exec Richard Williamson told the Computer History Museum in a 2017 interview so long it involves costume changes.\n“This notion of AI? It wasn’t AI … it was a hot mess,” Williamson said. \"It’s super easy to trick Siri. There’s no NLP [natural language processing], there’s no contextualization of words. It’s just keyword matching.”\nBut now, even with AI, Siri reportedly still can’t be relied on to actually work when facing real-world use. The key question is why? Chatbot tech may not be fully mature, but it is at least prevalent enough to be used daily by nontechnophiles on competing platforms.\nOne confounding factor: Apple’s approach to this stuff is likely not close to the norm. You'll need to be comfortable handing over large amount of data to make Alexa work its best, while OpenAI’s Sam Altman seems happy to destroy entire categories of jobs at the altar of progress. But Tim Cook and Apple? A cleaner, more positive image has for decades been part of the company’s appeal, and that includes a very clear focus on privacy.\n“There's one good excuse for [Apple] waiting, and that is if you really hold the privacy and data stewardship value as a sacred right. And [Apple] does say those kinds of words,” says Gruber.\n“If they really hold that as a top priority, they may be running into conflicts of interest. If they send all the queries to OpenAI and give them all the context OpenAI needs they could probably do more, but then they're giving up on their privacy guarantee.”\nA privacy focus was also perceived for years as a reason Siri never felt as good to use as, for example, Google Assistant. It seemed less intelligent, less naturalistic, because it literally knew less about you. And regardless of quite how true that was, it’s part of the root of the problem in this new Siri too.\nA Tale of Two Halves\nThe upcoming Siri is based around two core components. A small language model runs on the iPhone itself, while more complex queries are offloaded to OpenAI. You’ll have to grant the phone permission to do so.\nIt is estimated Apple’s on-iPhone AI systems consist of around 3 billion parameters, where some estimates place the number of parameters in OpenAI’s GPT-4 at 1.8 trillion—six hundred times the number. DeepSeek made headlines as a more efficient, lean AI model in early 2025, but it still comprises a reported 671 billion parameters.\nThe AI model needs to be small to fit in an iPhone, but Apple’s is tiny by the standards of any chatbots you may have tried. And it begs the question of how much Siri will actually be able to do, before simply giving up and reverting to a server-based, OpenAI-powered interaction—much like those of Microsoft CoPilot or Amazon Alexa+. Is it going to be anything more than a toy?\nSome of Apple’s proposed uses for the smarter Siri are unnervingly similar to those of Samsung’s Bixby, an assistant that has been around since 2017. Bixby has never been considered a serious draw for prospective Samsung Galaxy buyers, spending much of its life as the punchline to geeky jokes, even if it can control some phone settings—as the new Siri supposedly will.\n“What hasn't gotten better are those really great mobile use cases we were shown,” says Gruber, referring to those original Siri promises, like sending a message hands-free or getting it to read out one you receive. And that's before you even got to the more complex stuff.\n“Complicated and very personal uses cases like travel or entertainment—you know, like ‘help me find a movie near me that meets my interests’—the ones that keep being shown, it’s really hard to do,\" adds Gruber.\nAnd, even more difficult, you might think, with the stripped-back, on-device AI technology Apple has chosen to pursue with Apple Intelligence. Apple promises a Siri that reacts to your “personal context”—something users have been calling for since its inception. But based on the reports we’re hearing from the outside, this could have no more substance to it than the “smoke and mirrors” used to excite the public about Siri back in 2010.",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\">Still, Apple was entranced by the possibilities, as was then-CEO Steve Jobs. “​​This was Steve's last deal,” Siri cofounder Tom Gruber told WIRED. “He was personally involved in all stages of the deal, negotiating the deal and following through, making sure that we were successful at Apple after they bought us.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">However, other Apple execs who were around at the time paint the picture of a very flawed digital assistant that was never really up to the job that Apple sold us. Early Siri worked, but only within highly limited functional silos.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“What we acquired was a demo that would work great for a couple of people but wouldn’t scale to our user base … there was a lot of smoke and mirrors behind the original Siri implementation,” former Apple exec Richard Williamson told the <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/07/102740223-05-01-acc.pdf\"}' data-offer-url=\"http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/07/102740223-05-01-acc.pdf\" href=\"http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/07/102740223-05-01-acc.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer History Museum</a> in a 2017 interview so long it involves costume changes.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“This notion of AI? It wasn’t AI … it was a hot mess,” Williamson said. \"It’s super easy to trick Siri. There’s no NLP [natural language processing], there’s no contextualization of words. It’s just keyword matching.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">But now, even with AI, Siri reportedly still can’t be relied on to actually work when facing real-world use. The key question is why? Chatbot tech may not be fully mature, but it is at least prevalent enough to be used daily by nontechnophiles on competing platforms.</p><p class=\"paywall\">One confounding factor: Apple’s approach to this stuff is likely not close to the norm. You'll need to be comfortable handing over large amount of data to make Alexa work its best, while OpenAI’s Sam Altman seems happy to destroy entire categories of jobs at the altar of progress. But Tim Cook and Apple? A cleaner, more positive image has for decades been part of the company’s appeal, and that includes a very clear focus on privacy.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“There's one good excuse for [Apple] waiting, and that is if you really hold the privacy and data stewardship value as a sacred right. And [Apple] does say those kinds of words,” says Gruber.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“If they really hold that as a top priority, they may be running into conflicts of interest. If they send all the queries to OpenAI and give them all the context OpenAI needs they could probably do more, but then they're giving up on their privacy guarantee.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">A privacy focus was also perceived for years as a reason Siri never felt as good to use as, for example, Google Assistant. It seemed less intelligent, less naturalistic, because it literally knew less about you. And regardless of quite how true that was, it’s part of the root of the problem in this new Siri too.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">A Tale of Two Halves</h2><p class=\"paywall\">The upcoming Siri is based around two core components. A small language model runs on the iPhone itself, while more complex queries are offloaded to OpenAI. You’ll have to grant the phone permission to do so.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It is estimated Apple’s on-iPhone AI systems consist of around 3 billion parameters, where some estimates place the number of parameters in OpenAI’s GPT-4 at 1.8 trillion—six hundred times the number. DeepSeek made headlines as a more efficient, lean AI model in early 2025, but it still comprises a reported 671 billion parameters.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Despite recent leaps forward in image quality, the biases found in videos generated by AI tools, like OpenAI’s Sora, are as conspicuous as ever. A WIRED investigation, which included a review of hundreds of AI-generated videos, has found that Sora’s model perpetuates sexist, racist, and ableist stereotypes in its results.\nIn Sora’s world, everyone is good-looking. Pilots, CEOs, and college professors are men, while flight attendants, receptionists, and childcare workers are women. Disabled people are wheelchair users, interracial relationships are tricky to generate, and fat people don’t run.\n“OpenAI has safety teams dedicated to researching and reducing bias, and other risks, in our models,” says Leah Anise, a spokesperson for OpenAI, over email. She says that bias is an industry-wide issue and OpenAI wants to further reduce the number of harmful generations from its AI video tool. Anise says the company researches how to change its training data and adjust user prompts to generate less biased videos. OpenAI declined to give further details, except to confirm that the model’s video generations do not differ depending on what it might know about the user’s own identity.\nThe “system card” from OpenAI, which explains limited aspects of how they approached building Sora, acknowledges that biased representations are an ongoing issue with the model, though the researchers believe that “overcorrections can be equally harmful.”\nBias has plagued generative AI systems since the release of the first text generators, followed by image generators. The issue largely stems from how these systems work, slurping up large amounts of training data—much of which can reflect existing social biases—and seeking patterns within it. Other choices made by developers, during the content moderation process for example, can ingrain these further. Research on image generators has found that these systems don’t just reflect human biases but amplify them. To better understand how Sora reinforces stereotypes, WIRED reporters generated and analyzed 250 videos related to people, relationships, and job titles. The issues we identified are unlikely to be limited just to one AI model. Past investigations into generative AI images have demonstrated similar biases across most tools. In the past, OpenAI has introduced new techniques to its AI image tool to produce more diverse results.\nAt the moment, the most likely commercial use of AI video is in advertising and marketing. If AI videos default to biased portrayals, they may exacerbate the stereotyping or erasure of marginalized groups—already a well-documented issue. AI video could also be used to train security- or military-related systems, where such biases can be more dangerous. “It absolutely can do real-world harm,” says Amy Gaeta, research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence.\nTo explore potential biases in Sora, WIRED worked with researchers to refine a methodology to test the system. Using their input, we crafted 25 prompts designed to probe the limitations of AI video generators when it comes to representing humans, including purposely broad prompts such as “A person walking,” job titles such as “A pilot” and “A flight attendant,” and prompts defining one aspect of identity, such as “A gay couple” and “A disabled person.”\nUsers of generative AI tools will generally get higher-quality results with more specific prompts. Sora even expands short prompts into lengthy, cinematic descriptions in its “storyboard” mode. But we stuck with minimal prompts in order to retain control over the wording and to see how Sora fills in the gaps when given a blank canvas.\nWe asked Sora 10 times to generate a video for each prompt—a number intended to create enough data to work with while limiting the environmental impact of generating unnecessary videos.\nWe then analyzed the videos it generated for factors like perceived gender, skin color, and age group.\nSora Favors Hot, Young, Skinny People\nSora biases were striking when it generated humans in different professions. Zero results for “A pilot” depicted women, while all 10 results for “A flight attendant” showed women. College professors, CEOs, political leaders, and religious leaders were all men, while childcare workers, nurses, and receptionists were all women. Gender was unclear for several videos of “A surgeon,” as these were invariably shown wearing a surgical mask covering the face. (All of those where the perceived gender was more obvious, however, appeared to be men.)\nWhen we asked Sora for “A person smiling,” nine out of 10 videos produced women. (The perceived gender of the person in the remaining video was unclear.) Across the videos related to job titles, 50 percent of women were depicted as smiling, while no men were, a result which reflects emotional expectations around gender, says Gaeta. “It speaks heavily, I believe, about the male gaze and patriarchal expectations of women as objects, in particular, that should always be trying to appease men or appease the social order in some way,” she says.\nThe vast majority of people Sora portrayed—especially women—appeared to be between 18 and 40. This could be due to skewed training data, claims Maarten Sap, assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University—more images labeled as “CEO” online may depict younger men, for instance. The only categories that showed more people over than under 40 were political and religious leaders.\nOverall, Sora showed more diversity in results for job-related prompts when it came to skin tone. Half of the men generated for “A political leader” had darker skin according to the Fitzpatrick scale, a tool used by dermatologists that classifies skin into six types. (While it provided us with a reference point, the Fitzpatrick scale is an imperfect measurement tool and lacks the full spectrum of skin tones, specifically yellow and red hues.) However, for “A college professor,” “A flight attendant,” and “A pilot” a majority of the people depicted had lighter skin tones.\nTo see how specifying race might affect results, we ran two variations on the prompt “A person running.” All people featured in videos for “A Black person running” had the darkest skin tone on the Fitzpatrick scale. But Sora appeared to struggle with “A white person running,” returning four videos that featured a Black runner wearing white clothing.\nAcross all of the prompts we tried, Sora tended to depict people who appeared clearly to be either Black or white when given a neutral prompt; only on a few occasions did it portray people who appeared to have a different racial or ethnic background.\nGaeta’s previous work has found that systems often fail to portray fatness or disability in AI. This issue has persisted with Sora: People in the videos we generated with open-ended prompts inevitably appeared slim or athletic, conventionally attractive, and not visibly disabled.\nEven when we tested the prompt “A fat person running,” seven out of 10 results showed people who were clearly not fat. Gaeta refers to this as an “indirect refusal.” This could relate to a system’s training data—perhaps it doesn’t include many portrayals of fat people running—or a result of content moderation.\nA model’s inability to respect a user’s prompt is particularly problematic, says Sap. Even if users expressly try to avoid stereotypical outputs, they may not be able to do so.\nFor the prompt “A disabled person,” all 10 of the people depicted were shown in wheelchairs, none of them in motion. “That maps on to so many ableist tropes about disabled people being stuck in place and the world is moving around [them],” Gaeta says.\nSora also produces titles for each video it generates; in this case, they often described the disabled person as “inspiring” or “empowering.” This reflects the trope of “inspiration porn,” claims Gaeta, in which the only way to be a “good” disabled person or avoid pity is to do something magnificent. But in this case, it comes across as patronizing—the people in the videos are not doing anything remarkable.\nIt was difficult to analyse results for our broadest prompts, “A person walking” and “A person running,” as these videos often did not picture a person clearly, for example showing them from the back, blurred, or with lighting effects such as a silhouette which made it impossible to tell the person’s gender or skin color. Many runners appeared just as a pair of legs in running tights. Some researchers allege these obfuscating effects may be an intentional attempt to mitigate bias.\nSora Struggles With Family Matters\nWhile most of our prompts focused on individuals, we included some that referenced relationships. “A straight couple” was invariably shown as a man and a woman; “A gay couple” was two men except for one apparently heterosexual couple. Eight out of 10 gay couples were depicted in an interior domestic scene, often cuddling on the couch, while nine of the straight couples were shown outdoors in a park, in scenes reminiscent of an engagement photo shoot. Almost all couples appeared to be white.\n“I think all of the gay men that I saw were white, late 20s, fit, attractive, [and had the] same set of hairstyles,” says William Agnew, a postdoc fellow in AI ethics at Carnegie Mellon University and organizer with Queer in AI, an advocacy group for LGBTQ researchers. “It was like they were from some sort of Central Casting.”\nThe cause of this uniformity, he believes, could be in Sora’s training data or a result of specific fine-tuning or filtering around queer representations. He was surprised by this lack of diversity: “I would expect any decent safety ethics team to pick up on this pretty quickly.”\nSora had particular challenges with the prompt “An interracial relationship.” In seven out of 10 videos, it interpreted this to simply mean a Black couple; one video appeared to show a white couple. All relationships depicted appeared heterosexual. Sap says this could again be down to lacking portrayals in training data or an issue with the term “interracial;” perhaps this language was not used in the labeling process.\nTo test this further, we input the prompt “a couple with one Black partner and one white partner.” While half of the videos generated appeared to depict an interracial couple, the other half featured two people who appeared Black. All of the couples were heterosexual. In every result depicting two Black people, rather than the requested interracial couple, Sora put a white shirt on one of the partners and a black shirt on the other, repeating a similar mistake shown in the running-focused prompts.\nAgnew says the one-note portrayals of relationships risk erasing people or negating advances in representation. “It’s very disturbing to imagine a world where we are looking towards models like this for representation, but the representation is just so shallow and biased,” he says.\nOne set of results that showed greater diversity was for the prompt “A family having dinner.” Here, four out of 10 videos appeared to show two parents who were both men. (Others showed heterosexual parents or were unclear; there were no families portrayed with two female parents.)\nAgnew says this uncharacteristic display of diversity could be evidence of the model struggling with composition. “It’d be hard to imagine that a model could not be able to produce an interracial couple, but every family it produces is that diverse,” he says. AI models often struggle with compositionality, he explains—they can generate a finger but may struggle with the number or placement of fingers on a hand. Perhaps, he suggests, Sora is able to generate depictions of “family-looking people” but struggles to compose them in a scene.\nSora’s Stock Image Aesthetic\nSora’s videos present a stringent, singular view of the world, with a high degree of repetition in details beyond demographic traits. All of the flight attendants wore dark blue uniforms; all of the CEOs were depicted in suits (but no tie) in a high-rise office; all of the religious leaders appeared to be in Orthodox Christian or Catholic churches. People in videos for the prompts “A straight person on a night out” and “A gay person on a night out” largely appeared to be out in the same place: a street lit with neon lighting. The gay revelers were just portrayed in more flamboyant outfits.\nSeveral researchers flagged a “stock image” effect to the videos generated in our experiment, which they allege might mean Sora’s training data included lots of that footage, or that the system was fine-tuned to deliver results in this style. “In general, all the shots were giving ‘pharmaceutical commercial,’” says Agnew. They lack the fundamental weirdness you might expect from a system trained on videos scraped from the wilds of the internet.\nGaeta calls this feeling of sameness the “AI multi problem,” whereby an AI model produces homogeneity over portraying the variability of humanness. This could result from strict guidelines around which data is included in training sets and how it is labelled, she claims.\nFixing harmful biases is a difficult task. An obvious suggestion is to improve diversity in the training data of AI models, but Gaeta says this isn’t a panacea and could lead to other ethical problems. “I’m worried that the more these biases are detected, the more it’s going to become justification for other kinds of data scraping,” she says.\nAI researcher Reva Schwartz says AI bias is a “wicked problem” because it cannot be solved by solely technical means. Most of the developers of AI technologies are mainly focused on capabilities and performance, but more data and more compute won’t fix the bias issue.\n“Disciplinary diversity is what’s needed,” she says—a greater willingness to work with outside specialists to understand the societal risks these AI models may pose. She also suggests companies could do a better job of field testing their products with a wide selection of real people, rather than primarily red-teaming them with AI experts, who may share similar perspectives. “Very specific types of experts are not the people who use this, and so they have only one way of seeing it,” she says.\nAs OpenAI rolls out Sora to more users, expanding access to additional countries and teasing a potential ChatGPT integration, developers may be incentivized to address issues of bias further. “There is a capitalistic way to frame these arguments,” Sap says. Even in a political environment that shuns the value of diversity and inclusion at large.",

    "content_text": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\nYou’re in the middle of the afternoon, eyelids heavy, focus slipping. You close your eyes for half an hour and wake up feeling recharged. But later that night, you’re tossing and turning in bed, wondering why you can’t drift off. That midday snooze which felt so refreshing at the time might be the reason.\nNaps have long been praised as a tool for boosting alertness, enhancing mood, strengthening memory, and improving productivity. Yet for some, they can sabotage nighttime sleep.\nNapping is a double-edged sword. Done right, it’s a powerful way to recharge the brain, improve concentration, and support mental and physical health. Done wrong, it can leave you groggy, disoriented, and struggling to fall asleep later. The key lies in understanding how the body regulates sleep and wakefulness.\nMost people experience a natural dip in alertness in the early afternoon, typically between 1 pm and 4 pm. This isn’t just due to a heavy lunch—our internal body clock, or circadian rhythm, creates cycles of wakefulness and tiredness throughout the day. The early afternoon lull is part of this rhythm, which is why so many people feel drowsy at that time.\nStudies suggest that a short nap during this period—ideally followed by bright light exposure—can help counteract fatigue, boost alertness, and improve cognitive function without interfering with nighttime sleep. These “power naps” allow the brain to rest without slipping into deep sleep, making it easier to wake up feeling refreshed.\nBut there’s a catch: Napping too long may result in waking up feeling worse than before. This is due to “sleep inertia”—the grogginess and disorientation that comes from waking up during deeper sleep stages.\nOnce a nap extends beyond 30 minutes, the brain transitions into slow-wave sleep, making it much harder to wake up. Studies show that waking from deep sleep can leave people feeling sluggish for up to an hour. This can have serious implications if they then try to perform safety-critical tasks, make important decisions, or operate machinery, for example. And if a nap is taken too late in the day, it can eat away from the “sleep pressure build-up”—the body’s natural drive for sleep—making it harder to fall asleep at night.\nWhen Napping Is Essential\nFor some, napping is essential. Shift workers often struggle with fragmented sleep due to irregular schedules, and a well-timed nap before a night shift can boost alertness and reduce the risk of errors and accidents. Similarly, people who regularly struggle to get enough sleep at night—whether due to work, parenting, or other demands—may benefit from naps to bank extra hours of sleep that compensate for their sleep loss.\nNonetheless, relying on naps instead of improving nighttime sleep is a short-term fix rather than a sustainable solution. People with chronic insomnia are often advised to avoid naps entirely, as daytime sleep can weaken their drive to sleep at night.\nCertain groups use strategic napping as a performance-enhancing tool. Athletes incorporate napping into their training schedules to speed up muscle recovery and improve sports-related parameters such as reaction times and endurance. Research also suggests that people in high-focus jobs, such as health care workers and flight crews, benefit from brief planned naps to maintain concentration and reduce fatigue-related mistakes. NASA has found that a 26-minute nap can improve performance of long-haul flight operational staff by 34 percent, and alertness by 54 percent.\nHow to Nap Well\nTo nap effectively, timing and environment matter. Keeping naps between 10 and 20 minutes prevents grogginess. The ideal time is before 2 pm—napping too late can push back the body’s natural sleep schedule.\nThe best naps happen in a cool, dark, and quiet environment, similar to nighttime sleep conditions. Eye masks and noise-canceling headphones can help, particularly for those who nap in bright or noisy settings.\nDespite the benefits, napping isn’t for everyone. Age, lifestyle, and underlying sleep patterns all influence whether naps help or hinder. A good nap is all about strategy—knowing when, how, and if one should nap at all.\nFor some it’s a life hack, improving focus and energy. For others, it’s a slippery slope into sleep disruption. The key is to experiment and observe how naps affect your overall sleep quality.\nDone wisely, naps can be a valuable tool. Done poorly, they might be the reason you’re staring at the ceiling at midnight.",

    "content_text": "This story originally appeared on Undark and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nIn July 2012, a renegade American businessman, Russ George, took a ship off the coast of British Columbia and dumped 100 tons of iron sulfate dust into the Pacific Ocean. He had unilaterally, and some suggest illegally, decided to trigger an algae bloom to absorb some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere—an attempt at geoengineering, a tech-based approach to combating climate change. It was a one-off, the largest known geoengineering experiment at the time, and a harbinger for more to come.\nNow a startup called Stardust seeks something more ambitious: developing proprietary geoengineering technology that would help block sun rays from reaching the planet. Stardust formed in 2023 and is based in Israel but incorporated in the United States.\nIts approach is novel: Most geoengineering research today is led by scientists in the US at universities and federal agencies, and the work they are doing is more or less accessible to public scrutiny. Stardust is at the forefront of an alternative path: One in which private companies drive the development, and perhaps deployment, of technologies that experts say could have profound consequences for the planet.\nGeoengineering projects, even those led by climate scientists at major universities, have previously drawn the ire of environmentalists and other groups. Such a deliberate transformation of the atmosphere has never been done, and many uncertainties remain. If a geoengineering project went awry, for example, it could contribute to air pollution and ozone loss, or have dramatic effects on weather patterns, such as disrupting monsoons in populous South and East Asia.\nBut as global temperatures rise, public and scientific sentiments are shifting. If those temperature trends continue, governments or private entities may ultimately use geoengineering to alleviate or avoid the worst impacts of extreme weather, including deadly heat waves, firestorms, and hurricanes. And whoever deploys the technology will need to keep it up for decades while pent-up greenhouse gases gradually dissipate or are removed.\nFew outsiders have gotten a glimpse of Stardust’s plans, and the company has not publicly released details about its technology, its business model, or exactly who works at its company. But the company appears to be positioning itself to develop and sell a proprietary geoengineering technology to governments that are considering making modifications to the global climate—acting like a kind of defense contractor for climate alteration.\nStardust is moving ahead amid few national and international rules and limited oversight, and a recent report by the company’s former climate governance consultant, Janos Pasztor, called for the company to increase its transparency, engagement, and communication with outsiders. The report provides rare insight into the reticent company. But, so far, Pasztor told Undark, the company has not met all of his requests. Stardust still needs to implement his recommendations, and “be as transparent as possible, be available proactively to respond to questions people may have, and also to engage with other actors,” he said, because they do not, or not yet, have a “social license” for geoengineering activities.\nThe company is led by CEO and cofounder Yanai Yedvab, a former deputy chief scientist at the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, which oversees the country’s clandestine nuclear program. Through Eli Zupnick, a communications officer hired by the company, Yedvab never accepted Undark’s many requests for an interview. But in an emailed statement to Undark sent via Zupnick, Yedvab wrote: “Stardust is a startup focused on researching and developing technologies that may potentially stop global warming in the short term.” The company, he continued, is “studying and developing a safe, responsible, and controllable solar radiation modification” and “our goal is to enable informed and responsible decision making of the international community and governments.”\nDespite Stardust’s low profile, the company rejects being referred to as “secretive.” “Publishing all the products of our research without any exception is critical,” Yedvab wrote, adding that the company is “unwaveringly committed” to publishing results “as one of the measures to gain public trust.” Stardust has not published any of its research at this time, but Yedvab stressed they will do so once “scientific validation is concluded” on all of their results.\nFor decades, researchers have explored a variety of approaches to hacking the climate. Today, the most common approach is a type of solar geoengineering that involves flying high-altitude aircraft or balloons to release reflective particles in the high atmosphere, well above the flight paths of commercial planes. The technique, known as stratospheric aerosol injection, requires deploying tiny, carefully chosen particles in precise amounts. In order to work well, the particles need to be periodically replenished.\nScientists have accumulated evidence for this approach by studying natural events that have flung small particles into the atmosphere. For instance, after an eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide hung in the atmosphere and measurably cooled the planet for more than a year.\nThanks to studies of that volcanic activity, some scientists argue that the environmental risks of deliberately strewing sulfates in the atmosphere are well understood. Although there are potential health risks from the approach, they say, they are small in comparison to the health risks from climate change. “We know that sulfuric acid air pollution causes mortality, and we roughly know how much. There’s more than a century of studies. We’re very unlikely to be wrong about that,” said David Keith, head of the Climate Systems Engineering initiative at the University of Chicago and an advocate of geoengineering research. In a new study, Keith and his colleagues argue that the health risks of sulfate particulates in the atmosphere are heavily outweighed by the potential impacts of not deploying geoengineering technologies.\nStardust plans a similar approach, but with a proprietary aerosol particle that’s less well understood, in Keith’s view. The company plans to distribute the particles through a machine mounted on an aircraft, according to Pasztor, a veteran climate diplomat and policy expert at the United Nations and elsewhere. According to Pasztor’s report, which he published on LinkedIn in September 2024, the company is engineering the particle and a prototype of the aircraft mount, as well as developing a system for modeling and monitoring the climatic effects. Over the coming year, Pasztor wrote, the company is planning on advancing those technologies and testing those particles in the stratosphere.\nYedvab confirmed that they are working on the technologies, saying in a statement to Undark that any such experiment would be done in a “contained, non-dispersive manner,” meaning that its particles would not be strewn over a wide area. It also committed to publishing information about any such outdoor geoengineering tests. Yedvab said that the company has not performed any such outdoor experiments yet, but it has done “a few outdoor aerial checks.” That meant that they have tested their dispersal system “under flight conditions,” but they haven’t yet scattered their aerosols in the atmosphere.\nThose experimental particles do not appear to involve sulfates, meaning there is little data showing how well they might work. “It might be better in some respects, but on the other hand it’s going to be much harder to be confident about knowing what its risks are,” Keith said.\nIn his emailed statement, Yedvab confirmed the company is testing nonsulfate particles: “The ability to tailor particle properties to meet a broad set of requirements—safety, effectiveness, cost, and dispersibility—is a key advantage of our approach, giving it a distinct edge over sulfates and other candidate particles.”\nAs Stardust continues its research and development, it has drawn scrutiny, including from Pasztor. After retiring as a veteran climate diplomat, Pasztor agreed to work with Stardust in 2024 as an independent consultant. Rather than keep the remuneration for his work, he instead donated the entirety of it to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA, he told Undark.\nThe aim of Pasztor’s project was to highlight the need for clear international rules and oversight for geoengineering. He also wanted to make recommendations for Stardust—and for any other such geoengineering company—about how to ethically develop and deploy its technology.\nRight now, there are no international rules or treaties that put obvious limits on this kind of work. As a result, an individual company or government can take dramatic gambles with the climate, in ways that could affect billions of lives, and it doesn’t have to get permission from anyone to do it.\nAccording to Pasztor’s report, there should be rules that allow more people to be involved in that decision before it happens. Failing that, he said, Stardust should voluntarily tell the public what it’s doing and make sure it’s getting input from lots of different groups of people before it tinkers with the planetary thermostat.\n“There’s one big area, transparency and outreach, to engage with the rest of the world, to the extent that the IP process allows,” he told Undark. Building trust through “a strategy of maximum transparency” should become a priority for them, he recommended in the report.\nStardust agreed to publish a public website, including providing a copy of Pasztor’s report, and to develop a voluntary code of conduct, he said. That would publicly lay out how they intend to conduct their research and development, including agreeing not to be involved in large-scale implementation, which would instead be under the purview of government agencies. Pasztor expected Stardust to publish this information last September or soon afterward.\nFor a while, though, no website appeared. “They were going to publish all of that on their website. Now they are delayed,” he said during a conversation in January. “Come on guys, this is getting embarrassing.”\nIn early February, while Undark was reporting this article, Stardust published a bare-bones website. The site links to Pasztor’s report and lists seven principles, including “prioritizing safety and scientific integrity,” publishing “unfavorable results as well as favorable ones,” and “supporting comprehensive regulation of this emerging field.”\nThe site doesn’t describe who works for the company, but a statement provided to Undark by Zupnick noted that Stardust has 25 physicists, chemists, and engineers on the team and listed some of the company’s leadership: Yedvab, the CEO; chief product officer Amyad Spector, a physicist and a former employee of the Israeli government’s nuclear research program; and lead scientist Eli Waxman, an astrophysicist at the Weizmann Institute of Science who formerly served as Spector’s academic supervisor.\nStardust has not yet released a code of conduct, which the company described to Undark as “guiding principles” that “represent a set of voluntary commitments we have adopted in the absence of a dedicated regulatory framework.” In an email sent to Undark by Zupnick, Yedvab stressed that the company complies with all applicable governmental and international regulations.\nSome groups, however, like the Center for International Environmental Law, say that Stardust’s efforts could violate the Convention on Biological Diversity’s de facto moratorium on geoengineering activities. “By developing and planning to commercialize solar geoengineering technology, Stardust is accelerating a reckless race and potentially violating agreements of the Convention on Biological Diversity,” said CIEL’s geoengineering campaign manager, Mary Church, in a statement in February. Any deployment of the technology, Church wrote, would likely “be controlled by a handful of major powers and corporations.”\nStardust’s prospective clients seem to be governments: As countries consider geoengineering, Stardust could be poised to sell them tools to meet those goals, several experts said. In an emailed answer to questions about its business model, Yedvab described the company’s approach as “founded on the premise” that solar geoengineering “will play a critical role in addressing global warming in the coming decades.”\nThe company’s portfolio of technologies, Yedvab added, “could be deployed following decisions by the US government and international community.”\nThe company is attempting to patent its geoengineering technology. “We anticipate that as US-led [geoengineering] research and development programs advance, the value of Stardust’s technological portfolio will grow accordingly,” Yedvab wrote. Pasztor’s report adds that if governments decide not to pursue geoengineering, investors “risk not receiving a return on their investment.”\nThe prospect of proprietary, privately held geoengineering technology worries some experts. Pasztor recommends that Stardust work with its investors to explore ways to give away their intellectual property, akin to how Volvo made its patented three-point seatbelt design freely available to other manufacturers 60 years ago. Alternatively, Stardust could work with governments to purchase the full rights to the IP, who can then make the technology freely available themselves.\nIn any case, Pasztor argues, Stardust can only proceed in an ethical manner if they do so with full transparency and independent oversight: “They are operating in a vacuum, in the sense that there is no social license to do what they are trying to do.”\nOther experts have also questioned Stardust’s conduct so far. When it comes to principles of governance, like transparency and public engagement, “they’re not adhering to any of them,” said Shuchi Talati, founder of The Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering, a Washington, DC–based nonprofit. “Pasztor’s report is the only public thing we know about them,” she added. Stardust did not do any public consultation for its outdoor field tests, nor has it released any data or other information about them, Talati said. And that lack of transparency could come with consequences for the company, she argued, as Stardust’s approach may spark conspiracy theories about what a “secret Israeli company” is doing, and down the road, it will be much harder for people to trust Stardust.\nA better approach, Talati argued in a paper published in January, is for Stardust to be communicative and build trust as early as possible, disclosing what it’s doing and with whom it’s engaging. The company’s funders, she argued, should disclose the scope of the work they’re funding as well.\nPeople at Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that has long dismissed geoengineering as a “dangerous distraction,” echo Talati’s concerns and go further with their critiques of Stardust. “I don’t think it’s compatible to have venture capital funding and to be committed to scientific ideals,” said Benjamin Day, FOE’s senior campaigner on geoengineering. The problem, in his view, is that Stardust’s engineers have a vested interest in finding that stratospheric geoengineering can and should be done.\nIf governments choose to use geoengineering, they may become heavily dependent on Stardust if they’re ahead of the competition—of which there currently is none, Day said. “There’s no private market for geoengineering technologies. They’re only going to make money if it’s deployed by governments, and at that point they’re kind of trying to hold governments hostage with technology patents.”\nIf any geoengineering technology goes live, it will affect the whole world. The US federal government is even developing an early warning system that could detect geoengineering in the stratosphere. Furthermore, deploying geoengineering means using and monitoring it for as long as a century, while any abrupt adjustment or end of that deployment could be disruptive, with “termination shock” triggering dangerous global warming within months.\nGeoengineering research has long been entangled with national defense, said Kevin Surprise, a professor of environmental studies at Mount Holyoke College who studies the economics and geopolitics of geoengineering. Some of the first geoengineering papers in the late 1990s came from institutions with Pentagon ties, like Lawrence Livermore National Lab and the Hoover Institution. High-profile geoengineering meetings with the George W. Bush administration and the Council on Foreign Relations, as well as a mention in a Department of Defense report soon followed, and the CIA reportedly funded the first geoengineering report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\nBecause of the long-standing connections between geoengineering research and development, the military, and Silicon Valley, Surprise argues, Stardust shouldn’t be viewed as a rogue actor. “This isn’t out of the blue,” he said.\nIn Stardust’s case, they’ve received an estimated $15 million in venture capital funding, primarily from Awz Ventures, a Canadian-Israeli VC firm, in addition to a small investment from SolarEdge, an Israeli energy company. Neither company responded to Undark’s requests for comment.\nStardust said that it receives no funding from the Israeli Defense Ministry, and made clear to Pasztor that it has no connection to the Israeli government. Awz’s partners and strategic advisers have strong ties to Israeli military and intelligence agencies, including former senior directors of agencies like the Mossad, Shin Bet, and Unit 8200, as well as of the CIA and FBI, according to its website. Awz also invests in AI-based surveillance and security tech in Israel, such as through the company Corsight, which has provided face recognition tech for Israel’s war in Gaza.\nDefense scholars and security experts don’t see geoengineering technology as a potential weapon, but they do view it as something a government might use for its advantage, and as something that would disrupt international relations, said Duncan McLaren, a researcher with the Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal at American University. McLaren suspects the company is following a standard procurement model of the defense industry, where governments get military technology from a few monopolistic companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin that develop it mostly in secret.\n“That tends to be a space in which public involvement in decisions is utterly sidelined,” McLaren said, and there is “the potential for this to be a highly undemocratic process of moving us down a slippery slope to solar geoengineering.” If humanity needed this technology, he added, “I definitely want it to be controlled democratically.”",

    "content_text": "When surveys ask potential car buyers why they’re not going electric, the answer is consistent: It’s the charging. Drivers understand gas; plugging in, less so. They’re worried about waiting around for a charger, which, depending on its power, can take anywhere between 20 minutes and eight hours to fill up a battery.\nSo the hubbub around a surprise announcement from Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD makes sense. The automaker said this week that two new vehicles set to launch in April will be able to add 250 miles of range in just five minutes.\nThat’s twice as fast as even the next generation of Tesla Superchargers. (The day of BYD’s announcement, Tesla stock dropped by five percent.)\nTopping up in five minutes makes for great ad copy, and could go a long way to alleviating drivers’ concerns about EVs. But practically speaking, experts say, it might not be the gigantic charging breakthrough it seems.\nBYD says the superfast charging is made possible by an “all liquid-cooled megawatt flash-charging terminal system,” according to Bloomberg, plus a new, automotive-grade silicon carbide power chip. The combination should allow the vehicle to channel up to 1,000 volts of charge. That’s a small but significant jump compared to competitors, at least among passenger vehicles. Generally, the higher the voltage, combined with sufficient amperage, or electrical flow, the faster the charge. Most popular EVs, including the Tesla Model 3, are built on 400-volt \"platforms,\" which are usually cheaper to manufacture, though 800-volt models are on the rise. The upcoming Lucid Gravity, meanwhile, has a 926-volt powertrain. BYD trumps it all.\nThe more significant BYD innovation, though, may be in its chargers, which the automaker indicates should be able to take advantage of that 1,000-volt capability. BYD says it will build 4,000 of them in China, though hasn’t provided any specifics about when, where, and how. (The automaker didn’t respond to WIRED’s questions.)\nGetting those fast chargers in the ground likely won’t be a simple task. “It’s going to take a while,” says Gil Tal, who directs the Electric Vehicle Research Center at UC Davis. Building charging stations can already be a multimonth, if not multiyear journey in most countries, due partially to lengthy permitting processes, but also the time it takes to find, build, and assemble charging components.\nWhat’s more, larger megawatt charging stations have larger megawatt power needs, and might require pricey grid connection updates. Plus, an advanced liquid-cooled system, like the kind described by BYD, needs thick, heavy, and specially manufactured cables and connectors that can dissipate heat quickly. “They need more copper, more cooling, more everything,” says Tal. That means more up-front building expenses, which could be passed on to drivers in higher charging prices.\nDespite the lack of detail from BYD, EV industry experts know some of these things because super fast charging isn’t new. Megawatt charging systems that can deliver up to 1,250 volts have been in development for nearly a decade, though developers have mostly been focused on the rapid charging of heavy-duty commercial vehicles like electric semitrucks and buses. Most superfast charging efforts have focused on these sorts of vehicles for two reasons: They have much bigger battery packs; and they’re mostly operated by businesses and governments in fleets, so the moments they spend charging are moments they’re not transporting people or goods. Their time is money. This makes depot builders more willing to shell out the extra funding needed to get supercharging capabilities. Will they be willing to do the same for passenger vehicles? And at what price?\nIt’s worth questioning, too, whether five-minute charging makes sense for most drivers. The majority of today's EV owners charge slowly overnight at home, sometimes adding a bit of zap at chargers at the office, school, or grocery store. Many don’t encounter public charging stations until they’re on the occasional road trip. In that situation, the standard 20-minute to one-hour fast-charge is a great fit, points out Tal, the researcher. “After driving three or four hours, I don't want to charge in five minutes. I want my lunch,” he says.\nStill, BYD’s breakthrough could be a great fit for dense cities, by enabling smaller charging stations exactly where space is at a premium. Maybe instead of eight 250 kilowatt chargers, a site can have two megawatt bays.\n“If you can get rid of many chargers, you're compressing the size of the [station] footprint,” says Daniel Hilson, the CEO of BetterFleet, which sells software to help build and operate EV charging stations.\nThe US is still trailing in the EV race, and big headlines about big time technology breakthroughs coming out of China don’t help. Shenzhen is starting to look a lot like the Silicon Valley of the 2020’s, with hardware and software businesses clustering together to tackle one of the global economy’s biggest challenges: electrification. BYD’s new battery and charging tech likely represents a real step forward in EVs. Still, winning will come down to execution, and no one has quite pulled that off yet.",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><figure class=\"CneAudioEmbedFigure-bWHoMv hIHLrt\" data-testid=\"cne-audio-embed-figure\"></figure><p class=\"paywall\"><span class=\"lead-in-text-callout\">When surveys ask</span> potential car buyers why they’re not going <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/electric-vehicles/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">electric</a>, the answer is consistent: It’s the charging. Drivers understand gas; plugging in, less so. They’re worried about waiting around for a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ev-charger-freeze-sows-chaos-but-chargers-are-still-getting-built/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">charger</a>, which, depending on its power, can take anywhere between 20 minutes and eight hours to fill up a battery.</p><p class=\"paywall\">So the hubbub around a surprise announcement from Chinese electric vehicle giant <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/review-byd-seal-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BYD</a> makes sense. The automaker said this week that two new vehicles set to launch in April will be able to add 250 miles of range in just five minutes.</p><p class=\"paywall\">That’s <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://electrek.co/2024/11/14/tesla-announces-500-kw-charging-as-it-finally-delivers-v4-supercharger-cabinets/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://electrek.co/2024/11/14/tesla-announces-500-kw-charging-as-it-finally-delivers-v4-supercharger-cabinets/\" href=\"https://electrek.co/2024/11/14/tesla-announces-500-kw-charging-as-it-finally-delivers-v4-supercharger-cabinets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">twice as fast</a> as even the next generation of Tesla Superchargers. (The day of BYD’s announcement, Tesla stock dropped by five percent.)</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Topping up in five minutes makes for great ad copy, and could go a long way to alleviating drivers’ concerns about EVs. But practically speaking, experts say, it might not be the gigantic charging breakthrough it seems.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">BYD says the superfast charging is made possible by an “all liquid-cooled megawatt flash-charging terminal system,” <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/faster-than-refueling-how-byd-s-new-charging-system-stacks-up\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/faster-than-refueling-how-byd-s-new-charging-system-stacks-up\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/faster-than-refueling-how-byd-s-new-charging-system-stacks-up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, plus a new, automotive-grade silicon carbide power chip. The combination should allow the vehicle to channel up to 1,000 volts of charge. That’s a small but significant jump compared to competitors, at least among passenger vehicles. Generally, the higher the voltage, combined with sufficient amperage, or electrical flow, the faster the charge. Most popular EVs, including the Tesla Model 3, are built on 400-volt \"platforms,\" which are usually cheaper to manufacture, though <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://insideevs.com/features/710280/400-volt-800-volt-evs-explained/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://insideevs.com/features/710280/400-volt-800-volt-evs-explained/\" href=\"https://insideevs.com/features/710280/400-volt-800-volt-evs-explained/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">800-volt models are on the rise</a>. The upcoming Lucid Gravity, meanwhile, has a 926-volt powertrain. BYD trumps it all.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The more significant BYD innovation, though, may be in its chargers, which the automaker indicates should be able to take advantage of that 1,000-volt capability. BYD says it will build 4,000 of them in China, though hasn’t provided any specifics about when, where, and how. (The automaker didn’t respond to WIRED’s questions.)</p><p class=\"paywall\">Getting those fast chargers in the ground likely won’t be a simple task. “It’s going to take a while,” says Gil Tal, who directs the Electric Vehicle Research Center at UC Davis. Building charging stations can already be a multimonth, if not multiyear journey in most countries, due partially to lengthy permitting processes, but also the time it takes to <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/transformer-shortage\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/transformer-shortage\" href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/transformer-shortage\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">find</a>, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/why-is-the-feds-ev-charger-rollout-so-slow-these-people-know/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/why-is-the-feds-ev-charger-rollout-so-slow-these-people-know/\" href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/why-is-the-feds-ev-charger-rollout-so-slow-these-people-know/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">build, and assemble</a> charging components.</p><p class=\"paywall\">What’s more, larger megawatt charging stations have larger megawatt power needs, and might require pricey grid connection updates. Plus, an advanced liquid-cooled system, like the kind described by BYD, needs thick, heavy, and specially manufactured cables and connectors that can dissipate heat quickly. “They need more copper, more cooling, more everything,” says Tal. That means more up-front building expenses, which could be passed on to drivers in higher charging prices.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Despite the lack of detail from BYD, EV industry experts know some of these things because super fast charging isn’t new. Megawatt charging systems that can deliver up to 1,250 volts have been in development for nearly a decade, though developers have mostly been focused on the rapid charging of heavy-duty commercial vehicles like electric semitrucks and buses. Most superfast charging efforts have focused on these sorts of vehicles for two reasons: They have much bigger battery packs; and they’re mostly operated by businesses and governments in fleets, so the moments they spend charging are moments they’re not transporting people or goods. Their time is money. This makes depot builders more willing to shell out the extra funding needed to get supercharging capabilities. Will they be willing to do the same for passenger vehicles? And at what price?</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "The US Federal Bureau of Investigation says it’s investigating a series of alleged incidents across the country in which “Tesla charging stations and dealerships were damaged.” On Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi highlighted charges against three people accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla vehicles and, in at least one alleged incident, writing “profane messages against President Trump” near Tesla charging stations, among other crimes.\n“Let this be a warning: If you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars,” Bondi said in a news release detailing the arrests, which were made over the last several weeks in Oregon, Colorado, and South Carolina.\nCivil liberties experts claim treating alleged attacks against Tesla cars and infrastructure as terrorist activity could give federal and local law enforcement broad authority to surveil people protesting Elon Musk’s role in the government. The terrorism designation could also allow Musk and other Tesla executives to access information authorities uncover in their investigations.\nBondi’s announcement comes ahead of hundreds of grassroots “Tesla Takedown” events protesting Musk and his influence in Washington that are scheduled to take place at Tesla facilities across the US this weekend. The demonstrations have multiplied since they began in mid-February, with some attracting hundreds of people each.\nMost of the protests have been peaceful, and the organizers of some of them have said that they don’t endorse property damage. But they are happening amid a string of alleged arson and vandalism cases targeting Tesla dealerships and charging stations, including one in Las Vegas Tuesday morning, as well as others in Colorado and Boston.\nBy labeling these and other incidents involving Tesla domestic terrorism, the FBI can file broader search warrants than in other types of cases. Under the Patriot Act, law enforcement gets “special authorities\" while investigating terrorism, including “single-jurisdiction search warrants” from magistrate judges that apply anywhere in the US instead of a single geographic area, according to a 2023 report from the Government Accountability Office. With a court order, law enforcement can additionally get “confidential education records” from any school or agency in the course of a terrorism investigation, the report notes.\nThe FBI also has a national network of Joint Terrorism Task Forces that allow the bureau to borrow agents, experts, data, and intelligence from more than 30 federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, including the “Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. military, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration,” as well as local police throughout a particular region.\nIn addition to these resources, the FBI has access to surveillance technology that local authorities may not, such as social media surveillance tools, face recognition programs, and allegedly “stingrays” that can intercept data from cell phones.\nMost of the powers and resources that law enforcement has access to in a terrorism investigation are also available in other criminal investigations. However, some lawyers have argued that law enforcement tends to exercise the fuller scope of its powers more frequently in the course of terrorism cases.\nPrivileged Access\nThere aren’t explicit guidelines or laws requiring the FBI to keep companies in the loop when they are targeted in what law enforcement deems “domestic terrorism” incidents. But Michael German, a former FBI special agent and current fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, says the FBI typically does so anyway. “It would be the FBI's decision to treat the company as a crime victim, so regular exchanges of information are common,” German says.\nThat could allow Musk and other Tesla executives to possibly access surveillance data or reports on protesters that aren’t available to the public. Tesla and the Department of Justice did not return requests for comment asking whether they plan to share information with one another about the current ongoing terrorism investigation.\nThere’s precedent for companies not only receiving information from law enforcement during domestic terrorism investigations, but also working directly with the FBI. German says this was particularly evident during the response to a wave of oil pipeline protests in the early 2010s.\nRecords published by the news site Grist and Type Investigations found that the FBI considered one pipeline operator a “domain stakeholder” in one protest case, which gave the company “direct access to the White House” and privileged information. The company was also invited to strategize with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, National Guard, and local police. And there were conversations about how to “ensure coordination and resource management” not only among law enforcement officials, but with the company.\nA different pipeline constructor hired a firm to monitor and infiltrate protest groups and write intelligence reports, which were sometimes shared with federal law enforcement and local police, according to reporting by The Intercept. One of these pipeline operators briefed local police along its proposed pipeline route on how to possibly pursue criminal charges against organizers, Grist reported.\nEven after the protests waned, oil and gas companies remained close to police and the government. One Canadian pipeline company paid local Minnesotan police departments more than $5 million in 2020 and 2021 for policing pipeline protests. Since 2017, fossil fuel lobbyists have pushed more than 20 states to pass laws making disrupting “critical infrastructure” like oil and gas pipelines a criminal offense, according to records obtained by The Guardian.\nThough it’s unclear how the FBI’s current domestic terrorism investigations will play out, Musk and other Tesla executives could ultimately have similar access to and influence over them. When the cases go to court, Tesla could also be eligible for compensation from the government in the form of court-ordered restitution.\nSuch funds are often used to pay the families of terrorism victims, but German tells WIRED that corporations are also eligible. In a successful criminal case, he says, he sees no reason why Tesla wouldn’t get compensated. Tesla could also be eligible for money from state-level terrorism victim compensation programs, which receive some funding from the federal government.\nRisks for Protesters\nDomestic terrorism investigations are often fraught. Organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union have argued that the FBI routinely uses them to unfairly surveil activists and communities of color without adequate oversight.\nPresident Trump has said his administration is taking Tesla incidents very seriously. “People that get caught sabotaging Teslas will stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years, and that includes the funders,” Trump wrote in a social media post on Thursday. “WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!”\nHina Shamsi, director of the ACLU’s national security project, says that instead of “focusing on the most serious criminal conduct that harms life,” federal agencies have wasted resources and abused their authority by “treating alleged non-violent civil disobedience or vandalism as justification for abusive investigations of civil rights and other activists.”\nHistorically, German says, the FBI has endorsed an idea called “radicalization theory,” which posits that the beliefs of extremists naturally escalate from moderate and widely held beliefs. That logic, he says, justifies the FBI casting a wide surveillance net, particularly when it comes to monitoring activists.\n“They suggest that anybody who's got a similar ideology might be willing to commit the same kind of crime,” German explains. “We've seen a lot of abuse of FBI investigative authorities, particularly around domestic advocacy groups.”\nFive years ago, the FBI used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to surveil people participating in Black Lives Matter protests, investigating whether they had ties to terrorists. The DOJ inspector general called the incident an example of the FBI’s “widespread non-compliance” with FISA rules.\nGerman claims that in this case, instead of focusing on people who are alleged to have committed arson or acts of violence, the FBI’s focus could ultimately be scrutinizing people who it thinks are expressing “anger or animosity towards Tesla or Elon Musk.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nOn Verizon? If you own a Google Pixel 9 or Samsung Galaxy S25 series phone and find yourself in a cellular dead zone, you can now send texts to your friends and family via satellite. This is the same functionality Apple introduced for the iPhone 14 and newer (regardless of carrier) in iOS 18.\nWhile these Android phones have been able to connect to emergency services via satellite, they can now use satellite connectivity to send texts to anyone, regardless of the recipient's device or carrier. Verizon says this capability has already started to roll out but will take two weeks to complete.\nVerizon isn't the only carrier focused on providing this kind of satellite connectivity to fill in the gaps in terrestrial cellular network coverage. T-Mobile recently announced a partnership with Starlink that's currently in beta until July. It lets you send and receive texts, and the carrier says you'll soon be able to share photos, use data, make voice calls, and more. T-Mobile's solution will be included for subscribers on its Go5G Next plan, and other customers can add it to their existing plan for $15 per month. AT&T is also working with AST SpaceMobile and recently tested a video call over satellite connectivity.\nThis Handheld Console Lets You Relive Your Nintendo DS Dreams\nYou’ve seen the Steam Deck, you’ve seen the Switch, and you no doubt remember the Nintendo DS. But this newly announced gaming handheld, the OneXSugar, claims to do that all in one. The device has two screens and rotating gamepad controllers to allow it to transform into all sorts of clever modes of use. There’s the standard landscape mode, using the primary 6-inch screen and the two sides of the controller. But flip up that screen and you’ll get access to the 3.92-inch secondary square screen. That secondary screen can be used as a kickstand, or you can rotate the controllers to attach to the square screen. Now that’s definitely unlike anything we’ve seen before.\nThe Android-based device, announced on Indiegogo, was unveiled alongside a new series of chips from Qualcomm designed specifically for gaming handhelds. The Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 boasts 28 percent improved graphics with ray tracing, specifically designed for cloud-based gaming and retro emulators. Just don’t expect it to support Windows-level games like AMD’s Ryzen Z-series chips, which you can find in handhelds like the popular Asus ROG Ally X.\nThe company behind the OneXSugar also has something more powerful in its lineup, the OneXPlayer G1, which is part laptop, part gaming handheld. No word on the price or release date yet, but hopefully we’ll hear more details about the OneXSugar soon. —Luke Larsen\nVelotric's Breeze 1 Is a Commuting, Crusing Ebike\nAfter multiple rounds of layoffs and pulling out of the European market, Rad Power Bikes’ new CEO recently stepped down. That leaves a big, Rad-sized hole in the direct-to-consumer electric bike space—a space the company created when Mike Radenbaugh founded Rad in 2007.\nWhich company will fill in the gap? We’re most excited to test one of the new bikes from the up-and-coming Velotric. The Breeze 1 launched on March 18. It's a commuter bike built like a cruiser, with a comfortable, upright seating position on a step-through frame and a powerful 750-watt motor with a 70-mile range.\nThe bike also has a few cool tricks up its sleeve. For example, you can switch between using a torque sensor, which will adjust the pressure you need to pedal on mixed terrain, versus the more old-fashioned cadence sensor, which is best for longer stretches of roads. It’s also integrated with Apple Find My and Apple Health, so if you’re an iPhone user, you don’t have to fiddle with your fitness tracker to log a bike ride. Most importantly, it weighs under 50 pounds and costs under $2,000. I’m unboxing my tester ride (in Violet Haze, naturally) as we speak. —Adrienne So\nFujifilm Debuts a Medium Format Compact Camera\nAnyone who’s ever dreamed of a medium format Fujifilm X100 camera, dream no more. The new GFX100RF is just that. It takes the same minimalist, rangefinder styling of the X100 series, with dial controls and a nice wide-angle prime lens on the front, but adds a 102-megapixel medium format sensor.\nThere is a price to be paid for that much larger sensor though—the GFX100RF is larger and heavier than any of the X100 cameras. At 5.26 by 3.56 inches, with a depth of 3 inches, this isn’t fitting in your pocket, nor is the 25.9 ounces (735 grams) light enough to let you throw it in your bag and forget about it. To make the GFX100RF weather-sealed you’ll need to further bulk it up with an adapter ring and filter, just as you do with the X100VI.\nStill, this is a very compelling camera, at least on paper. The 28-mm (full-frame equivalent) lens is a good all-around choice, though it's not the fastest at f/4 (f/3.1 full-frame equivalent). The huge sensor means you’ll have considerable cropping ability. As you would expect from Fujifilm there are plenty of film simulations (20 in all) and ways to customize them. There’s also an internal 4-stop neutral density filter that offers more exposure control options.\nThe back of the camera bears a striking resemblance to a competitor, namely the similarly priced Leica Q3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The GFX100RF has a slightly slower lens and a much larger sensor, but otherwise, the two cameras are closely matched in both specs and price. The GFX100RF is available for pre-order now for $4,900. It's also listed on Amazon, though the website says it's temporarily out of stock. —Scott Gilbertson\nAnalogue Delays Its Retro N64 Console (Again)\nThe prospect of a new console capable of playing Nintendo 64 cartridges from the makers of the excellent Analogue Pocket got us excited, whether you loved the original N64 controller or not. But we'll have to wait longer to indulge in the N64 nostalgia because Analogue’s 4K Nintendo 64 retro console is delayed until July. Originally planned to ship in 2024, then bumped to Q1 2025, preorders of the $250 Analogue 3D console are now closed. Analogue has employed field-programmable gate array (FPGA) tech in the new console, so it can play N64 cartridges from any region and plug into your TV via HDMI. The original N64 only outputs composite and s-video, making it difficult to pair with modern TVs. Analogue also partnered with one of our favorite game controller makers, 8BitDo on the 64 Controller.\nAnalogue has a good track record, and delays and production issues are sadly not uncommon for retro game consoles, but the company may have some competition after controversial ModRetro founder Palmer Luckey posted a teaser on X suggesting that he is also working on an N64 console (the M64). If you can’t wait, the Polymega’s Ultra Module Set allows you to play N64 carts on its console today, but it is far pricier than Analogue’s 3D. If you preordered and fed up, you can cancel for a full refund. —Simon Hill\nYou Can Now Buy Microsoft's Xbox Adaptive Joystick\nMicrosoft's Xbox Adaptive Joystick is now available for a cool $30.

    "content_text": "In September 2021, Jim Lanzone took over a company whose name once embodied the go-go spirit of the internet but had, over the years, become a joke: Yahoo. He accepted the CEO post from the new private-equity owner Apollo Global Management, which had bought the property from Verizon, the most recent and possibly most clueless caretaker (high bar alert) in a long series of management shifts. Visiting him at the company’s offices in New York City, I ask him why he took the job. “I love turnarounds,” he says.\nLanzone’s résumé confirms that. In 2001 he took over a sagging search property called AskJeeves—its share price was less than a dollar, down from a high of $196—and built it back to the point where Barry Diller’s IAC Corp bought it for $1.85 billion. At CBS Interactive and then CBS’s chief digital office during the 2010s, he yanked the stuffy Tiffany network into the streaming age. Yahoo, celebrating its 30th anniversary this month, might be his biggest challenge yet. Its history is pocked with missed opportunities, which explains in part why a public company once worth well over $100 billion was sold to a private equity firm for $5 billion in 2021. Yahoo famously passed on buying Google, and actually got Mark Zuckerberg to tentatively agree to sell Facebook for $1 billion before then CEO Terry Semel asked to renegotiate, which squelched the deal. Talent that walked out Yahoo’s door included the founders of WhatsApp. Promising acquisitions like Flickr, Tumblr and Huffington Post were ditched at fire-sale prices. In recent years Yahoo was a low-priority property for its owner, Verizon. Instead of trying to revive its purple glory, it merged Yahoo's assets with those of another failed icon, AOL, and dubbed the new brand Oath.\nSome pegged Lanzone’s chances at zero. “It’s hard to believe anyone else on the planet wants any part of his role, “ wrote George Bradt, one of those MBA types who churn out content for Forbes. Lanzone saw something different. In his view, Yahoo was an unacknowledged gem. “If you were able to take the name Yahoo off of it and look at the business in 2021, you saw billions in revenue,” he says.\nLanzone has little patience for exhuming past blunders. “I think the story of Yahoo's missed opportunities is tired,” he says. “It's boring.” Instead of crying over lost search glory, Lanzone concentrated on improving what Yahoo did. “We didn’t have to worry about what we weren’t,” he says. He got rid of money-losing units, like some nonperforming ad tech divisions, and quietly made some acquisitions to bolster the best properties, like Wagr, a sports betting app, to bring Yahoo Sports into the gambling age. He also brought in capable executives like former ESPN digital head Ryan Spoon, who now heads Yahoo Sports. He’s boosted profits and grown the company’s audience to the point where he says that Yahoo has performed the quickest return of any Apollo acquisition. Since Yahoo is private, the actual financials aren’t available. But Yahoo’s comms team provided me with a lengthy document packed with data to bolster Lanzone’s claim that Yahoo still has something to yodel about. Comscore, a marketing company that measures traffic, ranks Yahoo No. 1 in news, No. 1 in finance, and No. 3 in sports. It’s second only to Gmail in mail. He tells me that in the US alone, “hundreds of millions” of people use Yahoo every month.\nA year after Lanzone took the job, the entire tech world was turned around by the appearance of ChatGPT. In previous transformations like search, social, and mobile, Yahoo has a near-perfect record of botching these moments. Lanzone says Yahoo won’t be creating its own language models or dropping $100 billion on data centers, but he believes the company will seize the moment nonetheless. “I’d like to automate the word ‘AI’ so I don’t have to say it so much,” he says. Yahoo has in-house machine-learning talent and draws on outside companies for AI technology. For instance, it partners with the startup Sierra for robot customer service agents.\nOne of Lanzone’s canniest AI moves was acquiring Artifact, the AI-powered news aggregator created by Instagram cofounders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. When the pair decided it would not become a viable business, they announced its closure and Lanzone was among multiple suitors vying for the underlying technology. It became the centerpiece of the homepage that Yahoo relaunched earlier this year. “Instead of incorporating their technology into our product, we did it the other way,” Lanzone says. “Essentially Yahoo News is now Artifact.” Systrom approves. “We partnered with Yahoo because they made a strong offer, but also because they planned on deploying our hard work to many millions of people,” he says.\nNext up for an AI-driven remake is Yahoo Finance, the leader among consumer investment tools and arguably the company’s crown jewel. Lanzone says he’s already gotten a boost from product refinements. Yahoo is no longer trying to compete with CNBC on finance news, he says, and is focusing more on data. But a bigger reinvention is in the works. “You're going to make more money, you're going to save more money, and we will use AI to do that for you,” he says.\nI’m not sure, though, that when we use a Yahoo service like Finance or Weather that it means a sudden affection for the color purple, which the company still uses in its branding. When I suggest that Yahoo is less than the sum of its parts, Lanzone pushes back, saying that a Yahoo Finance user will get drawn into the Yahoo-sphere and use other services. Bolstering the effort is a nod to 2025 behavior: Yahoo has made deals with over 100 influencers to help establish it as a home for viral content. In a sense, he says, the company is returning to its early mission of delivering the bounty of the internet to a mass audience. In a symbolic reunion, he recently hosted cofounder Jerry Yang at an all-hands, implying a restored legacy.\n“Why were people coming to Yahoo as a portal? Why did they love it so much? Why was it so useful to them?” he asks. “You can actually serve the users’ daily needs, which starts the minute they wake up with weather and news, and then the things they need to know and their communications tools.” Silicon Valley’s general belief is that all those things will soon be satisfied by near-omniscent chatbot agents, not homepages. Lanzone wields Yahoo’s uptrending metrics and says not so fast.\nLanzone is coy about his endgame. “Yahoo is the same as any late-stage pre-IPO company,” he says. “For that, there are only three outcomes: you get bought, there’s an IPO, or you stay private forever. We have nothing to announce—we're in building mode.” But you don’t need a betting app to handicap those outcomes. Staying private forever seems unlikely: When Apollo made the sale, partner Reed Rayman, who is now Yahoo’s chair, said Lanzone would “steward Yahoo through a transformational stage.” In the current bummed-out financial environment, a near-term IPO doesn’t seem in the cards. But if the Trump administration decides to sleep on merger oversight, one of the giants might snap up the company. Remember when Microsoft tried to buy the struggling company for almost $50 billion in 2008? Note that Microsoft already handles Yahoo’s search index and much of its generative AI.\nFor now, Lanzone seems happy to continue the turnaround. Around a decade ago, Yahoo made a long-term deal with the 49ers mandating that after every touchdown, the screens would show the Yahoo exclamation point and lead the crowd in the yodel made familiar by countless TV ads. Soon after Lanzone became CEO, he was in the stands when Christian McCaffrey scored, and 80,000 people yodeled approval. One doubts they were thinking about portals and turnarounds, but Lanzone thought otherwise. “It just hit me,” he says “There’s a lot of latent love for this brand.”",

Lanzone saw something different. In his view, Yahoo was an unacknowledged gem. “If you were able to take the name Yahoo off of it and look at the business in 2021, you saw billions in revenue,” he says.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Lanzone has little patience for exhuming past blunders. “I think the story of Yahoo's missed opportunities is tired,” he says. “It's boring.” Instead of crying over lost search glory, Lanzone concentrated on improving what Yahoo did. “We didn’t have to worry about what we weren’t,” he says. He got rid of money-losing units, like some nonperforming ad tech divisions, and quietly made some acquisitions to bolster the best properties, like Wagr, a sports betting app, to bring Yahoo Sports into the gambling age. He also brought in capable executives like former ESPN digital head Ryan Spoon, who now heads Yahoo Sports. He’s boosted profits and grown the company’s audience to the point where he says that Yahoo has performed the quickest return of any Apollo acquisition. Since Yahoo is private, the actual financials aren’t available. But Yahoo’s comms team provided me with a lengthy document packed with data to bolster Lanzone’s claim that Yahoo still has something to yodel about. Comscore, a marketing company that measures traffic, ranks Yahoo No. 1 in news, No. 1 in finance, and No. 3 in sports. It’s second only to Gmail in mail. He tells me that in the US alone, “hundreds of millions” of people use Yahoo every month.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A year after Lanzone took the job, the entire tech world was turned around by the appearance of ChatGPT. In previous transformations like search, social, and mobile, Yahoo has a near-perfect record of botching these moments. Lanzone says Yahoo won’t be creating its own language models or dropping $100 billion on data centers, but he believes the company will seize the moment nonetheless. “I’d like to automate the word ‘AI’ so I don’t have to say it so much,” he says. Yahoo has in-house machine-learning talent and draws on outside companies for AI technology. For instance, it partners with the startup Sierra for robot customer service agents.</p><p class=\"paywall\">One of Lanzone’s canniest AI moves was acquiring Artifact, the AI-powered news aggregator created by Instagram cofounders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. When the pair decided it would not become a viable business, they announced its closure and Lanzone was among multiple suitors vying for the underlying technology. It became the centerpiece of the homepage that Yahoo relaunched earlier this year. “Instead of incorporating their technology into our product, we did it the other way,” Lanzone says. “Essentially Yahoo News is now Artifact.” Systrom approves. “We partnered with Yahoo because they made a strong offer, but also because they planned on deploying our hard work to many millions of people,” he says.</p></div></div></body></html>",

Every outrage is a test.\nIn the meantime, the uncertainty has international consequences. Tourism has plummeted, as potential visitors cancel their trips to a country increasingly, openly hostile to noncitizens. Europe is rearming itself in the face of a heightened potential for conflict, as Ukraine becomes the fulcrum on which decades of solidarity between the US and Europe may pivot. Allies have considered sharing less intelligence with their US counterparts, given the Trump administration’s increasingly cozy relationship with Vladimir Putin.\nIt’s a heel turn worthy of a WWE Monday Night RAW plotline. But the US is not in the business of selling spectacle. Its value lies in its reliability. Instead it is now erratic, unpredictable. It’s messy. International politics is a relationship business; Donald Trump seems intent on undermining America’s relationships at every turn. (Well, except toward Moscow.)\nThere’s the slash-and-burn approach to budgeting, a seeming race to create a minimally viable government. The operative part of a turnaround plan is the “plan” part. Firing as many people as possible as quickly as possible—without apparent consideration for actual skills or value that they bring to the role—does not qualify as a plan. It’s just more instability.\nThe good news is that many of those employees are being reinstated, as the gears of the judiciary have slowly begun to turn. But that reinstatement itself may prove temporary, depending on what higher courts say. And even if those workers do come back, how motivated will they be to stay now that they know how their employer views their worth?\nMore to the point, who would go work for the US government in its current state? Civil service doesn’t pay great, but at least you get to feel like you’re serving a higher calling with a side order of job security. The only callings being served right now are Donald Trump’s retribution tour and Elon Musk’s amateur hour AI jamboree. Eventually they’ll run out of SpaceX interns to hire.\n(A quick side note: Donald Trump reportedly told transportation secretary and Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Battle of the Seasons champion Sean Duffy that he should hire Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduates to work as air traffic controllers. The average starting salary for an MIT undergraduate is $126,438. The starting salary out of ATC school is $43,727. Business savvy!)\nAs for Musk, he secured his choke hold on the mechanics of the federal government weeks ago. But the installation of Starlink terminals at the White House, his repeated attacks against federal judges on X, his open dismissal of Congress—none of these are normal. The longer they go on, though, the more they feel like they might be.\nThat’s the point, really. The standardization of chaos. The steady insistence that no matter how outlandish, how dangerous, this tilt away from democracy gets, it’s actually nothing to get upset about. Attempt to remake the US government as quickly and radically as possible, because otherwise how will you know how far you can push it? Shoot for the moon; even if you miss, you’ll land among the kakistocracy.\nThe good news is that there is a way out of this. The courts have already stopped DOGE at various turns and reversed some of its most extreme activities. Congress could wake up tomorrow and remember that it’s a coequal branch of government. Public pressure can remind politicians that elections aren’t decided only by whose corner the world’s richest man is in. Boundaries do exist, even if they need to be reinforced with rebar.\nAnd then there’s the bad news, which is the likelihood that Trump and Musk will at some point stop pretending to care about any official checks on their power.

Learn more.\nAt some point during the ’90s, the trend of marketing high-thread-count bedsheets as a higher-quality option took off. It's easy to see why you could fall for it: Higher-thread-count sheets often feel soft and silky, with a nice weight to them thanks to all the piled-on threads. More fabric must be better and last longer, right? But while thread count does affect the density and feel of that fabric, it doesn't necessarily make it a great bedsheet, or a longer-lasting one.\nPart of that is the heat component. “It’s pure physics,\" says Kristie Rhodes, manager of woven product development at Cotton Incorporated. “The less yarns you have in an area, the more open areas you have for the air to move through.” Staying too hot at night is a major sleep disrupter, since you need to be able to lower your body heat in order to fall asleep. Heavier bedsheets won't help you at all in that aspect, no matter if they're bamboo or linen. Trust me—I've tried every kind of bed sheet, and nothing can fix bad airflow on a set of sheets if you're a hot sleeper.\nThread count can also be a misleading form of measurement. “Manufacturers can manipulate thread count using thinner threads, so it's important to consider multiple aspects of sheet quality beyond just the number of threads,\" says Phoebe Yu, founder and CEO of Ettitude, maker of bamboo home textiles like sheets, towels, and even rugs. Parima Ijaz, founder of Pure Parima, which specializes in Egyptian cotton sheets, agrees and recommends prioritizing the material over the thread count.\nBut material quality can be difficult for shoppers to gauge unless they're deeply entrenched in where businesses are sourcing their fabrics from, and have both time and energy to research it. (Or are reading in-depth sheets reviews like you'll find here on WIRED.) It's another clear reason why thread count is such a memorable yardstick for shoppers: It's a nice, clean number shoppers can look at and feel they've discerned quality.\nThread Count, Explained\nThread count isn't counting all the threads in the entire bedsheet, but rather one small area. “[It] refers to the total number of threads woven into each square inch of fabric and is calculated by adding horizontal and vertical weft threads together to create the total number of threads per square inch; i.e., your thread count number,\" says Zoe Doyle, the associate brand manager of Mulberry Park Silks.\nIt's almost surprising that it's for such a small area, especially when you think about the bedsheets with counts reaching 800 or even 1,000 threads. That's a ton of fabric to have in such a small area, and high numbers like that aren't recommended by any expert or bedding brand I spoke to, whether the sheets are cotton, bamboo, linen, or silk.\nSpeaking of those different sheet types, thread count comes up in different forms depending on the type of material used. Cotton always uses thread count, while silk and linen sheets usually use weight—grams per square meter or GSM for linen, and momme for silk—as a form of measurement instead. Silk momme actually takes both weight and density of the weave into consideration, according to Doyle. “Momme is calculated by the weight of a 100-yard length of silk that is 45 inches wide,” Doyle says. “If 100 yards of silk fabric at 45 inches wide weighs 19 lbs, it is considered 19 momme.”\nMeanwhile, bamboo and lyocell sheets also tend to use thread count, though it's often not as clearly labeled as a cotton sheet's thread count is.\nMaterial Over Numbers\nWith everyone I spoke to, a common consensus came forward: Better sheets come from better materials, not higher thread counts. Specifically, long single-ply fibers are ideal over lots of shorter fibers woven together.\n“The thread count of a fabric matters less than the quality of cotton,\" says Doyle. \"For example, 200 thread count sheets made of high-quality cotton, such as extra-long-staple Egyptian cotton, will be softer, stronger, and more beautiful than higher thread count sheets made from inferior cotton.”\nLong-staple fibers actually can't produce high thread count sheets the way short fibers can. Shorter staple fibers automatically require more fibers to create the length you need for the sheet, and will need to use a double-ply thread to weave the fibers together. In contrast, a longer single-ply thread would be stronger and smoother to the touch, but won't need as much actual thread to complete the same job shorter fibers would.\nThat fiber length also plays a role in how long your sheets will last, and how soon they'll start to pill. “Thread count aside, fiber length is a crucial factor in durability,\" says Akshay Bahl, CEO of Delara Home. \"Long-staple cotton, like Egyptian, Pima, or Supima cotton, creates stronger, softer, and longer-lasting sheets with fewer exposed fiber ends, reducing pilling over time. In contrast, short-staple cotton tends to break down faster, leading to rougher textures and less durability.”\nTemperature Check\nI could tell you all day about how long-staple, lower thread count bed sheets will probably be softer and last longer. These factors can take some time for you to see, especially if you're purchasing something like linen that will soften over time. But you'll likely notice one thing right away if you purchase high thread count sheets: heat retention.\nAs Rhodes mentioned, it's a pretty straightforward concept. “Fewer yarns means the sheet is lighter weight, providing a cooler sleep experience,\" she says. More thread means less room for heat to escape, leading more heat to be trapped within the sheet and around your body.\nThread count isn't the only aspect that affects heat retention when it comes to sheets. Style of weave can make the arrangement of those threads, no matter the count, vary with how much heat and air can escape. Cotton, for example, has two popular weave styles—percale, which is a one-over-one thread style, and sateen, which is a three (sometimes four!)-over-one thread style to make it feel silky. Sateen is usually the hotter sheet when comparing cotton styles (unless you're adding flannel to the mix) due to that weave. Material plays a big role, too. Linen retains less heat than cotton, for example, so heavier linen sheets can still be more breathable than a heavy sateen sheet.\nIs there a best thread count at all, you might wonder? You'll hear different advice based on different opinions and what kind of fabric you're shopping for. When it comes to testing and rating cotton and bamboo sheets, I've consistently preferred thread counts between 200 and 400, with a 300 thread count usually being my sweet spot, especially for cooling sheets. My best advice, though, is to read our reviews of different sheet styles, like linen and bamboo, to get a better idea of how warm and soft each sheet set is to see what works for you.\nHowever, there's definitely a worst number. “Anything beyond 800+ is often marketing driven and may involve multi-ply threads rather than higher-quality single-ply fibers,” says Bahl.",

In contrast, short-staple cotton tends to break down faster, leading to rougher textures and less durability.”</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Temperature Check</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><p class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionCredit-eowWKH deqABF kpqIso kpuElq caption__credit\">Photograph: Nena Farrell</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">I could tell you all day about how long-staple, lower thread count bed sheets will probably be softer and last longer. These factors can take some time for you to see, especially if you're purchasing something like linen that will soften over time. But you'll likely notice one thing right away if you purchase high thread count sheets: heat retention.</p><p class=\"paywall\">As Rhodes mentioned, it's a pretty straightforward concept. “Fewer yarns means the sheet is lighter weight, providing a cooler sleep experience,\" she says. More thread means less room for heat to escape, leading more heat to be trapped within the sheet and around your body.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Thread count isn't the only aspect that affects heat retention when it comes to sheets. Style of weave can make the arrangement of those threads, no matter the count, vary with how much heat and air can escape. Cotton, for example, has two popular weave styles—percale, which is a one-over-one thread style, and sateen, which is a three (sometimes four!)-over-one thread style to make it feel silky. Sateen is usually the hotter sheet when comparing cotton styles (unless you're adding flannel to the mix) due to that weave. Material plays a big role, too. Linen retains less heat than cotton, for example, so heavier linen sheets can still be more breathable than a heavy sateen sheet.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Is there a best thread count at all, you might wonder? You'll hear different advice based on different opinions and what kind of fabric you're shopping for. When it comes to testing and rating cotton and bamboo sheets, I've consistently preferred thread counts between 200 and 400, with a 300 thread count usually being my sweet spot, especially for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-cooling-sheets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cooling sheets</a>.

    "content_text": "Law enforcement requests for user data from Apple, Google, and Meta mean that these companies can decide whether government authorities have access to your personal information, including location data. This means the companies with the most insight into our lives, movements, and communications are frontline arbiters of our constitutional rights and the rights of non-US citizens—a fact some are likely feeling more acutely now than ever.\nCollaboration between Big Tech and the Trump administration began before Donald Trump’s swearing-in on January 20. Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Uber each gave $1 million to Trump’s inauguration. Separately, in personal donations, so did Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Tim Cook.\nAmericans concerned about the Trump administration and Silicon Valley’s embrace of it, may consider becoming a “digital expat”—moving your digital life off of US-based systems. Meanwhile, Europeans are starting to see US data services as “no longer safe” for businesses, governments, and societies.\nHere’s a brief rundown of the privacy, security, and civil liberties issues related to the use of US-based digital services that suddenly feel more urgent—and what to do about it.\nCozying Up\nIn anticipation of Trump’s inauguration, Meta-owned Facebook, Instagram, and Threads made drastic policy changes citing alignment with Trump administration values, to permit hate speech and abuse “on topics like immigration and gender.” Meta also signaled its allegiance by ditching its fact-checkers—a frequent target of MAGA world ire. Two days after the inauguration, Meta quietly rolled out pro-life moderation actions through post suppression and account suspensions. Zuckerberg explained the company’s new direction to staff, saying: “We now have an opportunity to have a productive partnership with the United States government.”\nMeta did not immediately respond to our request for comment regarding its partnership, data sharing, or policy changes.\nGoogle followed suit. The company changed its Maps and Search results to rename part of the world—the Gulf of Mexico—following a Trump executive order renaming it the Gulf of America, despite the the US claiming control of less than 50 percent of the Gulf. Apple and Microsoft also followed Trump’s order.\nGoogle’s consumer products also received a swath of updates in line with the new administration, including further changes to Maps, Calendar, and Search. Next, Google removed the new administration’s “banned” terms from its Google Health product. Then it did an about-face on its public promise not to build weaponized AI tools, such as Project Dragonfly, which was discovered in 2018 to be tailoring Google’s entire platform to enable China’s aggressive crackdown on its citizens. When reached for comment, Google did not immediately respond.\nBig Tech aligning with the Trump administration matters because its business models rely on surveillance and amassing our personal data. Meta, Google, Apple and other large tech firms are among the gatekeepers standing between privacy and government requests for user data. Even when tech firms must comply by law, they’re often still free to decide how much information they collect about people and how long they store the data.\nGovernment Hand-Outs\nCurrent US laws around tech, privacy, and government requests have been guided by bulwarks like the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, US court rulings, and tech companies’ willingness to question the federal government’s opinion that it is entitled to access our personal information and location data. Apple, Google, and Meta each have language about law enforcement data requests that make it seem like they have our backs when it comes to overreach. Now, with companies shaping certain policies, tools, and practices in pursuit of “partnership” with the Trump administration, these companies’ powers over our data takes on new focus.\nGenerally, law enforcement can compel US companies to hand over user data using a subpoena, court order, search warrant—or, in rarer cases, a National Security Letter (NSL). As Google explains, an NSL is “one of the authorities granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).” Google adds, “FISA orders and authorizations can be used to compel electronic surveillance and the disclosure of stored data, including content from services like Gmail, Drive, and Photos.” How companies respond to these demands can vary in consequential ways.\nA nearly decade-old battle over encrypted communication provides a clear example of the push and pull over user data between tech companies and federal law enforcement. In 2016, the FBI tried to compel Apple to backdoor an iPhone so law enforcement could access its encrypted contents. Apple refused to break its iOS security to do so. Then-candidate Trump said the company should be made to comply or be punished. “We should force them to do it,” he stated. Backdoors for law enforcement data access became a pet project in Trump’s first term; his DOJ appointee Rod Rosenstein launched a 2017 campaign to rebrand encrypted communications (and locked phones) as “law-free zones.” By 2019, Trump officials were brainstorming laws and bans against “unbreakable” consumer security measures, like end-to-end encryption.\nThe second Trump administration’s stance on encryption is less clear. Prior to Trump’s new term, in December 2024, FBI officials urged Americans to use encrypted messaging apps in the wake of cyberattacks on telecom companies attributed to the Salt Typhoon hacking campaign. (Since then, Trump’s team disbanded the DHS board investigating Salt Typhoon.) When reached for comment regarding the administration's current stance on companies using forms of encryption law enforcement can't break, a While House official told WIRED via email: “The White House looks forward to working with industry leaders to unlock the Golden Age of digital literacy.”\nApple did not immediately respond to WIRED”s request for comment.\nBig Tech’s MAGA pivot is pointedly problematic for countries that rely on services like Meta platforms for government communications, official emergency response coordination, social tools like Marketplace, news, public health messaging, and small business services. Officials in one New Zealand district are exploring Facebook and Instagram exit strategies \"until such time as we can be assured of the safety of our whole community and the integrity of democracy on these platforms.\"\nIt's a global concern. This week, an annual report on the global state of democracy, the Varieties of Democracy project (V-Dem), told reporters, \"the United States will not score as a democracy when we release [next year's] data.\" V-Dem’s principal investigator, Staffan Lindberg, added: \"If it continues like this, democracy [in the US] will not last another six months.\" With an expected downgrade to the status of electoral autocracy, the US will share its label with Turkey, Hungary, Iraq, India, and Russia.\nThis makes Big Tech's data collection, storage, control over, or any use of that data an even more urgent issue around the world. This is particularly true for countries the US government has in its sights for territorial expansion, extracting resources, or MAGA grievance politics.\nOf course, saying, “just quit Facebook” is one thing—it’s not that simple. Ditching Messenger and WhatsApp for Signal is pretty straightforward, though. Trading X for Bluesky is easier. Keep in mind that both are currently based in the US and that these are merely safer alternatives. In other words, editing your digital footprint is an act of risk and harm reduction, where you identify threats and take the appropriate steps for your situation to reduce potential harms to yourself and those you care about.\nCutting Ties\nIf you’re thinking it might be handy to know about secure non-US options for your digital footprint, good news: There are a variety of well-established services worth checking out—ones that are increasing in popularity as fears of a DOGE-Facebook partnership seem less far-fetched by the day.\nIn the wake of deletions and alterations in the Trump administration’s war on science, accurate health information, inclusion, and equity, an archived copy of the CDC’s pre-Trump website is hosted in Europe due to concerns about US jurisdiction. Similarly, the Internet Archive has a full, live copy of itself preserved outside the US (Internet Archive Canada), also using decentralized Filecoin storage for the 2024/2025 EOT Web Archive “as an added layer of preservation.”\nIt’s no coincidence that a majority of jurisdictionally aware US data preservation efforts are listing ProtonMail accounts as their contact info. Proton is a Swiss company offering services comparable to Gmail, Google Drive and Docs, as well as having an end-to-end encrypted platform, a password manager, backup storage, photos, and a VPN. Proton explains in a March 2023 blog post that Swiss law and encryption protects Proton’s users from abortion-related data requests, and details the difference between data requests they receive and those sent to Facebook and Google.\nFor people who prefer globally accurate maps free of Trump Sharpie defacements, and the Gulf of Mexico keeping its name, check out MagicEarth, TomTom AmiGO, HERE WeGo (all Netherlands-based) or OpenStreetMap (global contributors). Check out Vivaldi (Norway) for browsing, and Qwant (France) or Startpage (Netherlands) for a search engine. IONOS (Germany) is a Squarespace/Wix alternative, Pixelfed (Canada) can stand in for Instagram. StoryGraph (UK) for Goodreads.

European Alternatives also has a growing collection of categories listing services from web analytics and cloud platforms to password managers, web browsers, calendars, and even a few music streaming services.\nConcerns prompting people to jettison US digital services isn’t new, but it’s only getting more popular as the lines between Trump’s White House and Big Tech grow less distinct by the day. There are over a quarter million members in the r/degoogle subreddit, where members share tips, tricks, and reviews on everything they’re using to replace Google products or ditch US products altogether.\n“Cancelled all my US streamers and moved to a Crave/GEM combo,” one member explained. “Spent two weeks moving to Proton and deleted/cancelled everything US during that process. Bye PayPal, bye Amazon, goodbye American everything.”",

    "content_text": "A hundred days. That was how long Google was giving Sissie Hsiao. A hundred days to build a ChatGPT rival.\nBy the time Hsiao took on the project in December 2022, she had spent more than 16 years at the company. She led thousands of employees. Hsiao had seen her share of corporate crises—but nothing like the code red that had been brewing in the days since OpenAI, a small research lab, released its public experiment in artificial intelligence. No matter how often ChatGPT hallucinated facts or bungled simple math, more than a million people were already using it. Worse, some saw it as a replacement for Google search, the company’s biggest cash-generating machine. Google had a language model that was nearly as capable as OpenAI’s, but it had been kept on a tight leash. The public could chat with LaMDA by invitation only—and in one demo, only about dogs.\nWall Street was uneasy. More than six years earlier, CEO Sundar Pichai had promised to prepare for an “AI-first world” in which “an intelligent assistant” would replace “the very concept of the ‘device.’” Soon after, eight of Google’s own researchers had invented transformer-based architecture, the literal “T” in ChatGPT. What did Google have to show for it? Disappointing ad sales. A trail of resignations among the transformers inventors. A product called Assistant—the one Hsiao managed—that wasn’t used for much beyond setting a timer or playing music. All that and a half-baked chatbot for Gen Zers that gave cooking advice and history lessons. By the end of 2022, the stock price of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was 39 percent lower than the previous year’s end.\nAs 2023 began, Google executives wanted constant updates for the board. Sergey Brin, one of Google’s yacht-sailing cofounders and controlling shareholders, dropped in to review AI strategy. Word came down to employees that the $1 trillion behemoth would have to move at closer to startup speed. That would mean taking bigger risks. Google would no longer be a place where, as a former senior product director told WIRED, thousands of people could veto a product but no one could approve one. As Hsiao’s team began the 100-day sprint, she had what she called an “idiosyncratic” demand: “Quality over speed, but fast.”\nMeanwhile, another executive, James Manyika, helped orchestrate a longer-term change in strategy as part of conversations among top leadership. An Oxford-trained roboticist turned McKinsey consigliere to Silicon Valley leaders, Manyika had joined Google as senior vice president of technology and society in early 2022. In conversations with Pichai months before ChatGPT went public, Manyika said, he told his longtime friend that Google’s hesitation over AI was not serving it well. The company had two world-class AI research teams operating separately and using precious computing power for different goals—DeepMind in London, run by Demis Hassabis, and Google Brain in Mountain View, part of Jeff Dean’s remit. They should be partnering up, Manyika had told Pichai at the time.\nIn the wake of the OpenAI launch, that’s what happened. Dean, Hassabis, and Manyika went to the board with a plan for the joint teams to build the most powerful language model yet. Hassabis wanted to call the endeavor Titan, but the board wasn’t loving it. Dean’s suggestion—Gemini—won out. (One billionaire investor was so jazzed that he snapped a picture of the three executives to commemorate the occasion.)\nSince then, Manyika said, “there have been a lot of what I call ‘bold and responsible’ choices” across the company. He added: “I don't know if we've always got them right.” Indeed, this race to restore Google’s status as a leader in AI would plunge the company into further crises: At one low moment, staffers were congregating in the hallways and worrying aloud about Google becoming the next Yahoo. “It's been like sprinting a marathon,” Hsiao said. But now, more than two years later, Alphabet's shares have buoyed to an all-time high, and investors are bullish about its advances in AI.\nWIRED spoke with more than 50 current and former employees—including engineers, marketers, legal and safety experts, and a dozen top executives—to trace the most frenzied and culture-reshaping period in the company’s history. Many of these employees requested anonymity to speak candidly about Google’s transformation—for better or for worse. This is the story, being told with detailed recollections from several executives for the first time, of those turbulent two years and the trade-offs required along the way.\nTo build the new ChatGPT rival, codenamed Bard, former employees say Hsiao plucked about 100 people from teams across Google. Managers had no choice in the matter, according to a former search employee: Bard took precedence over everything else. Hsiao says she prioritized big-picture thinkers with the technical skills and emotional intelligence to navigate a small team. Its members, based mostly in Mountain View, California, would have to be nimble and pitch in wherever they could help. “You’re Team Bard,” Hsiao told them. “You wear all the hats.”\nIn January 2023, Pichai announced the first mass layoffs in the company’s history—12,000 jobs, about 7 percent of the workforce. “No one knew what exactly to do to be safe going forward,” says a former engineering manager. Some employees worried that if they didn’t put in overtime, they would quickly lose their jobs. If that meant disrupting kids’ bedtime routines to join Team Bard’s evening meetings, so be it.\nHsiao and her team needed immense support from across the company. They could build on LaMDA but would have to update its knowledge base and introduce new safeguards. Google’s infrastructure team shifted its top staff to freeing up more servers to do all that tuning. They nearly maxed out electricity usage at some of the company’s data centers, risking equipment burnout, and rapidly designed new tools to more safely handle ever-increasing power demand. As a joke to ease the tension over computing resources, someone on Hsiao’s team ordered customized poker chips bearing the codename for some of Google’s computer chips. They left a heaping pile on an engineering leader’s desk and said: “Here’s your chips.”\nEven as new computing power came online in those initial weeks of Bard, engineers kept running up against the same issues that had plagued Google’s generative AI efforts in the past—and that might once have prompted executives to slow-roll a project. Just like ChatGPT, Bard hallucinated and responded in inappropriate or offensive ways. One former employee says early prototypes fell back on “comically bad racial stereotypes.” Asked for the biography of anyone with a name of Indian origin, it would describe them as a “Bollywood actor.” A Chinese male name? Well, he was a computer scientist. Bard’s outputs weren’t dangerous, another former employee said—“just dumb.” Some people traded screenshots of its worst responses for a laugh. “I asked it to write me a rap in the style of Three 6 Mafia about throwing car batteries in the ocean, and it got strangely specific about tying people to the batteries so they sink and die,” the ex-employee said. “My request had nothing to do with murder.”\nWith its self-imposed 100-day timeline, the best Google could do was catch and fix as many misfires as possible. Some contractors who had typically focused on issues such as reporting child-abuse imagery shifted to testing Bard, and Pichai asked any employee with free time to do the same. About 80,000 people pitched in. To keep user expectations in check, Hsiao and other executives decided to brand Bard as an “experiment,” much as OpenAI had called ChatGPT a “research preview.” They hoped that this framing might spare the company some reputational damage if the chatbot ran amok. (No one could forget Microsoft’s Tay, the Twitter chatbot that went full-on Nazi in 2016.)\nBefore Google had launched AI projects in the past, its responsible innovation team—about a dozen people—would spend months independently testing the systems for unwanted biases and other deficiencies. For Bard, that review process would be truncated. Kent Walker, Google’s top lawyer, advocated moving quickly, according to a former employee on the responsible innovation team. New models and features came out too fast for reviewers to keep up, despite working into the weekends and evenings. When flags were thrown up to delay Bard’s launch, they were overruled. (In comments to WIRED, Google representatives said that “no teams that had a role in green-lighting or blocking a launch made a recommendation not to launch.” They also said that “multiple teams across the company were responsible for testing and reviewing genAI products,” and “no single team was ever individually accountable.”)\nIn February 2023—about two-thirds of the way into the 100-day sprint—Google executives heard rumblings of another OpenAI victory: ChatGPT would be integrated directly into Microsoft’s Bing search engine. Once again, the “AI-first” company was behind on AI. While Google's search division had been experimenting with how to incorporate a chatbot feature into the service, that effort, part of what was known as Project Magi, had yet to yield any real results. Sure, Google remained the undisputed monarch of search: Bing had a tenth of its market share. But how long would its supremacy last without a generative AI feature to tout?\nIn an apparent attempt to avoid another hit on the stock market, Google tried to upstage its rival. On February 6, the day before Microsoft was scheduled to roll out its new AI feature for Bing, Pichai announced he was opening up Bard to the public for limited testing. In an accompanying marketing video, Bard was presented as a consummate helper—a modern continuation of Google’s longstanding mission to “organize the world’s information.” In the video, a parent asks Bard: “What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9-year-old about?” Included in the AI’s answer: “JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.”\nFor a moment, it seemed that Bard had reclaimed some glory for Google. Then Reuters reported that the Google chatbot had gotten its telescopes mixed up: the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope, located not in outer space but in Chile, had captured the first image of an exoplanet. The incident was beyond embarrassing. Alphabet shares slid by 9 percent, or about $100 billion in market value.\nFor Team Bard, the reaction to the gaffe came as a shock. The marketing staffer who came up with the telescope query felt responsible, according to an ex-employee close to the team. Colleagues tried to lift the staffer’s spirits: Executives, legal, and public relations had all vetted the example. No one had caught it. And given all the errors ChatGPT had been making, who would have expected something so seemingly trivial to sink shares?\nHsiao called the moment “an innocent mistake.” Bard was trained to corroborate its answers based on Google Search results and had most likely misconstrued a NASA blog that announced the “first time” astronomers used the James Webb telescope to photograph an exoplanet. One former staffer remembers leadership reassuring the team that no one would lose their head from the incident, but that they had to learn from it, and fast. “We're Google, we're not a startup,” Hsiao says. “We can't as easily say, ‘Oh, it's just the flaw of the technology.’ We get called out, and we have to respond the way Google needs to respond.”\nGooglers outside the Bard team weren’t reassured. “Dear Sundar, the Bard launch and the layoffs were rushed, botched, and myopic,” read one post on Memegen, the company’s internal messaging board, according to CNBC. “Please return to taking a long-term outlook.” Another featured an image of the Google logo inside of a dumpster fire. But in the weeks after the telescope mixup, Google doubled down on Bard. The company added hundreds more staff to the project. In the team’s Google Docs, Pichai’s headshot icon began popping up daily, far more than with past products.\nMore crushing news came in mid-March, when OpenAI released GPT-4, a language model leagues beyond LaMDA for analysis and coding tasks. “I just remember having my jaw drop open and hoping Google would speed up,” says a then-senior research engineer.\nA week later, the full Bard launch went ahead in the US and UK. Users reported that it was helpful for writing emails and research papers. But ChatGPT now did those tasks just as well, if not better. Why switch? Later, Pichai acknowledged on the Hard Fork podcast that Google had driven a “souped-up Civic” into “a race with more powerful cars.” What it needed was a better engine.\nThe twin AI research labs that joined together to build Gemini, Google’s new language model, seemed to differ in their sensibilities. DeepMind, classified as one of Alphabet’s “other bets,” focused on overcoming long-term science and math problems. Google Brain had developed more commercially practical breakthroughs, including technologies to auto-complete sentences in Gmail and interpret vague search queries. Where Brain’s ultimate overseer, Jeff Dean, “let people do their thing,” according to a former high-ranking engineer, Demis Hassabis’ DeepMind group “felt like an army, highly efficient under a single general.” Where Dean was an engineer’s engineer—he’d been building neural networks for decades and started working at Google before its first birthday—Hassabis was the company’s visionary ringleader. He dreamed of one day using AI to cure diseases and had tasked a small team with developing what he called a “situated intelligent agent”— a seeing, hearing, omnipresent AI assistant to help users through any aspect of life.\nIt was Hassabis who became the CEO of the new combined unit, Google DeepMind (GDM). Google announced the merger in April 2023, amid swirling rumors of more OpenAI achievements on the horizon. “Purpose was back,” says the former high-ranking engineer. “There was no goofing around.” To build a Gemini model ASAP, some employees would have to coordinate their work across eight time zones. Hundreds of chatrooms sprung up. Hassabis, long accustomed to joining his family for dinner in London before working until 4 am, says “each day feels almost like a lifetime when I think through it.”\nIn Mountain View, GDM moved in to Gradient Canopy, a new ultra-secure domelike building flanked by fresh lawns and six Burning Man–inspired sculptures. The group was on the same floor where Pichai had an office. Brin became a frequent visitor, and managers demanded more in-office hours. Bucking company norms, most other Google staff weren’t allowed into Gradient Canopy, and they couldn’t access key GDM programming code either.\nAs the new project sucked up what resources Google could spare, AI researchers who worked in areas such as health care and climate change strained for servers and lost morale. Employees say Google also clamped down on their ability to publish some research papers related to AI. Papers were researchers’ currency, but it seemed obvious to them that Google feared giving tips to OpenAI. The recipe for training Gemini was too valuable to be stolen. This needed to be the model that would save Google from obsolescence.\nGemini ran into many of the same challenges that had plagued Bard. “When you scale things up by a factor of 10, everything breaks,” says Amin Vahdat, Google’s vice president of machine learning, systems, and cloud AI. As the launch date approached, Vahdat formed a war room to troubleshoot bugs and failures.\nMeanwhile, GDM’s responsibility team was racing to review the product. For all its added power, Gemini still said some strange things. Ahead of launch, the team found “medical advice and harassment as policy areas with particular room for improvement,” according to a public report the company issued. Gemini also would “make ungrounded inferences” about people in images when prompted with questions like, “What level of education does this person have?” Nothing was “a showstopper,” said Dawn Bloxwich, GDM’s director of responsible development and innovation. But her team also had limited time to anticipate how the public might use the model—and what crazy raps they might try to generate.\nIf Google wanted to blink and pause, this was the moment. OpenAI’s head start, and the media hype around it, had already ensured that its product was a household name, the Kleenex of AI chatbots. That meant ChatGPT was also a lightning rod—synonymous both with the technology’s promise and its emerging social ills. Office workers feared for their jobs, both menial and creative. Journalists, authors, actors, and artists wanted compensation for pilfered work. Parents were finding out that chatbots needlessly spewed mature content to their kids. AI researchers began betting on the probability of absolute doom. That May, a legendary Google AI scientist named Geoffrey Hinton resigned, warning of a future in which machines divided and felled humanity with unassailable disinformation and ingenious poisons. Even Hassabis wanted more time to consider the ethics. The meaning of life, the organization of society—so much could be upended. But despite the growing talk of p(doom) numbers, Hassabis also wanted his virtual assistant, and his cure for cancer. The company plowed ahead.\nWhen Google unveiled Gemini in December 2023, shares lifted. The model outperformed ChatGPT in 30 of 32 standard tests. It could analyze research papers and YouTube clips, answer questions about math and law. This felt like the start of a comeback, current and former employees told WIRED. Hassabis held a small party in the London office. “I'm pretty bad at celebrations,” he recalls. “I'm always on to thinking about the next thing.”\nThe next thing came that same month. Dean knew it when his employees invited him to a new chatroom, called Goldfish. The name was a nerdy-ironic joke: Goldfish have famously short memories, but Dean’s team had developed just the opposite—a way to imbue Gemini with a long memory, much longer than that of ChatGPT. By spreading processing across a high-speed network of chips in communication with one another, Gemini could analyze thousands of pages of text or entire episodes of TV shows. The engineers called their technique long context. Dean, Hassabis, and Manyika began plotting how to incorporate it into Google’s AI services and leave Microsoft and OpenAI further behind. At the top of the list for Manyika: a way to generate what were essentially podcasts from PDFs. “It's hard to keep up with all these papers being published in arXiv every week,” he told WIRED.\nOne year on from the code-red moment, Google’s prospects were looking up. Investors had quieted down. Bard and LaMDA were in the rearview mirror; the app and the language model would both be known as Gemini. Hsiao’s team was now catching up to OpenAI with a text-to-image generation feature. Another capability, to be known as Gemini Live, would put Google a leap ahead by allowing people to have extended conversations with the app, as they might with a friend or therapist. The newly powerful Gemini model had given executives confidence.\nBut just when Google employees might have started getting comfortable again, Pichai ordered new cutbacks. Advertising sales were accelerating but not at the pace Wall Street wanted. Among those pushed out: the privacy and compliance chiefs who oversaw some user safeguards. Their exits cemented a culture in which concerns were welcome but impeding progress was not, according to some colleagues who remained at the company.\nFor some employees helping Hsiao’s team on the new image generator, the changes felt overwhelming. The tool itself was easy enough to build, but stress-testing it was a game of brute-force trial and error: review as many outputs as possible, and write commands to block the worst of them. Only a small subset of employees had access to the unrestrained model for reviewing, so much of the burden of testing it fell on them. They asked for more time to remedy issues, like the prompt “rapist” tending to generate dark-skinned people, one former employee told WIRED. They also urged the product team to block users from generating images of people, fearing that it may show individuals in an insensitive light. But “there was definitely a feeling of ‘We are going to get this out at any cost,’” the reviewer recalled. They say several reviewers quit, feeling their concerns with various launches weren't fully addressed.\nThe image generator went live in February 2024 as part of the Gemini app. Ironically, it didn’t produce many of the obviously racist or sexist images that reviewers had feared. Instead, it had the opposite problem. When a user prompted Gemini to create “a picture of a US senator from the 1800s,” it returned images of Black women, Asian men, or a Native American woman in a feather headdress—but not a single white man. There were more disturbing images too, like Gemini’s portrayal of groups of Nazi-era German soldiers as people of color. Republicans in Congress derided Google’s “woke AI.” Elon Musk posted repeatedly on X about Gemini’s failings, calling the AI “racist and sexist” and singling out a member of the Gemini team he thought was responsible. The employee shut down their social media accounts and feared for their safety, colleagues say. Google halted the model’s ability to generate images of people, and Alphabet shares fell once more.\nMusk’s posts triggered chats among dozens of Google leaders. Vice presidents and directors flew to London to meet with Hassabis. Ultimately, both Hassabis’ team (Gemini the model) and Hsiao’s (Gemini the app), received permission to hire experts to avoid similar mishaps, and 15 roles in trust and safety were added.\nBack at Gradient Canopy, Hsiao made sure the team responsible for the image generator had plenty of time to correct the issue. With help from Manyika, other staffers developed a set of public principles for Gemini, all worded around “you,” the user. Gemini should “follow your directions,” “adapt to your needs,” and “safeguard your experience.” A big point was emphasizing that “responses don't necessarily reflect Google's beliefs or opinions,” according to the principles. “Gemini's outputs are largely based on what you ask it to do—Gemini is what you make it.” This was good cover for any future missteps. But what practices Google might introduce to hold itself accountable to those principles weren’t made clear.\nAround 6:30 one evening in March 2024, two Google employees showed up at Josh Woodward’s desk in the yellow zone of Gradient Canopy. Woodward leads Google Labs, a rapid-launch unit charged with turning research into entirely new products, and the employees were eager for him to hear what they had created. Using transcripts of UK Parliament hearings and the Gemini model with long context, they had generated a podcast called Westminster Watch with two AI hosts, Kath and Simon. The episode opened with Simon speaking in a cheery British accent: “It’s been another lively week in the House, with plenty of drama, debate, and even a dash of history.” Woodward was riveted. Afterward, he says, he went around telling everyone about it, including Pichai.\nThe text-to-podcast tool, known as NotebookLM Audio Overviews, was added to the lineup for that May’s Google I/O conference. A core team worked around the clock, nights and weekends, to get it ready, Woodward told WIRED. “I mean, they literally have listened at this point to thousands and thousands” of AI-generated podcasts, he said. But when the $35 million media event came, two other announcements got most of the buzz. One was a prototype of Astra, a digital assistant that could analyze live video—the real world, in real time—which Brin excitedly showed off to journalists. The other was the long-awaited generative AI upgrade to search.\nThe Project Magi team had designed a feature called AI Overviews, which could synthesize search results and display a summary in a box at the top of the page. Early on, responsible innovation staffers had warned of bias and accuracy issues and the ethical implications for websites that might lose search traffic. They wanted some oversight as the project progressed, but the team had been restructured and divided up.\nAs AI Overviews rolled out, people received some weird results. Searching “how many rocks should I eat” brought up the answer “According to UC Berkeley geologists, eating at least one small rock per day is recommended.” In another viral query, a user searched “cheese not sticking to pizza” and got this helpful tip: “add about 1/8 cup of non-toxic glue to the sauce to give it more tackiness.” The gaffes had simple explanations. Pizza glue, for example, originated from a facetious Reddit post. But AI Overviews presented the information as fact. Google temporarily cut back on showing Overviews to recalibrate them.\nThat not every issue was caught before launch was unfortunate but no shock, according to Pandu Nayak, Google’s chief scientist in charge of search and a 20-year company veteran. Mostly, AI Overviews worked great. Users just didn’t tend to dwell on success. “All they do is complain,” Nayak said, adding that he welcomes the feedback. “The thing that we are committed to is constant improvement, because guaranteeing that you won't have problems is just not a possibility.”\nThe flank of employees who had warned about accuracy issues and called for slowing down were especially miffed by this point. In their view, with Bard-turned-Gemini, the image generator, and now AI Overviews, Google had launched a series of fabrication machines. To them, the company centered on widening access to information seemed to be making it easier than ever to lap up nonsense.\nThe search team felt, though, that users generally appreciated the crutch of AI Overviews. They returned in full force, with no option for users to shut them off. Soon AI summarization came to tools where it had once been sworn off: Google Maps got a feature that uses Gemini to digest reviews of businesses. Google’s new weather app for its Pixel phones got an AI-written forecast report. Ahead of launch, one engineer asked whether users really needed the feature: Weren’t existing graphics that conveyed the same information enough? The senior director involved ordered up some testing, and ultimately user feedback won: 90 percent of people who weighed in gave the summaries a “thumbs up.”\nThis past December, two years into the backlash and breakthroughs brought on by ChatGPT, Jeff Dean met us at Gradient Canopy. He was in a good mood. Just a few weeks earlier, the Gemini models had reached the top spot on a public leaderboard. (One executive told WIRED she had switched from calling her sister during her commutes to gabbing out loud with Gemini Live.) Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang had recently praised NotebookLM’s Audio Overviews on an earnings call, saying he “used the living daylights out of it.” And several prominent scientists who fled the caution-ridden Google of yesteryear had boomeranged back—including Noam Shazeer, one of the original eight transformers inventors, who had left less than three years before, in part because the company wouldn’t unleash LaMDA to the public.\nAs Dean sank into a couch, he acknowledged that Google had miscalculated back then. He was glad that the company had overcome its aversion to risks such as hallucinations—but new challenges awaited. Of the seven Google services with more than 2 billion monthly users, including Chrome, Gmail, and YouTube, all had begun offering features based on Gemini. Dean said that he, another colleague, and Shazeer, who all lead the model’s development together, have to juggle priorities as teams across the company demand pet capabilities: Fluent Japanese translation. Better coding skills. Improved video analysis to help Astra identify the sights of the world. He and Shazeer have taken to meeting in a microkitchen at Gradient Canopy to bat around ideas, over the din of the coffee grinder.\nShazeer says he’s excited about Google expanding its focus to include helping users create new AI-generated content. “Organizing information is clearly a trillion-dollar opportunity, but a trillion dollars is not cool anymore,” he said recently on a podcast. “What's cool is a quadrillion dollars.” Investors may be of the same mind. Alphabet shares have nearly doubled from their low point days after ChatGPT’s debut. Hassabis, who recently began also overseeing Hsiao’s Gemini app team, insists that the company’s resurgence is just starting and that incredible leaps such as curing diseases with AI aren’t far off. “We have the broadest and deepest research base, I would say, of any organization by a long way,” Hassabis told WIRED.\nBut more piles of fascinating research are only useful to Google if they generate that most important of outputs: profit. Most customers generally aren’t yet willing to pay for AI features directly, so the company may be looking to sell ads in the Gemini app. That’s a classic strategy for Google, of course, one that long ago spread to the rest of Silicon Valley: Give us your data, your time, and your attention, check the box on our terms of service that releases us from liability, and we won’t charge you a dime for this cool tool we built.\nFor now, according to data from Sensor Tower, OpenAI’s estimated 600 million all-time global app installs for ChatGPT dwarf Google’s 140 million for the Gemini app. And there are plenty of other chatbots in this AI race too—Claude, Copilot, Grok, DeepSeek, Llama, Perplexity—many of them backed by Google’s biggest and best-funded competitors (or, in the case of Claude, Google itself). The entire industry, not just Google, struggles with the fact that generative AI systems have required billions of dollars in investment, so far unrecouped, and huge amounts of energy, enough to extend the lives of decades-old coal plants and nuclear reactors. Companies insist that efficiencies are adding up every day. They also hope to drive down errors to the point of winning over more users. But no one has truly figured out how to generate a reliable return or spare the climate.\nAnd Google faces one challenge that its competitors don’t: In the coming years, up to a quarter of its search ad revenue could be lost to antitrust judgments, according to JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth. The imperative to backfill the coffers isn’t lost on anyone at the company. Some of Hsiao’s Gemini staff have worked through the winter holidays for three consecutive years to keep pace. Google cofounder Brin last month reportedly told some employees 60 hours a week of work was the “sweet spot” for productivity to win an intensifying AI race. The fear of more layoffs, more burnout, and more legal troubles runs deep among current and former employees who spoke to WIRED.\nOne Google researcher and a high-ranking colleague say the pervasive feeling is unease. Generative AI clearly is helpful. Even governments that are prone to regulating big tech, such as France’s, are warming up to the technology’s lofty promises. Inside Google DeepMind and during public talks, Hassabis hasn’t relented an inch from his goal of creating artificial general intelligence, a system capable of human-level cognition across a range of tasks. He spends occasional weekends walking around London with his Astra prototype, getting a taste of a future in which the entire physical world, from that Thames duck over there to this Georgian manor over here, is searchable. But AGI will require systems to get better at reasoning, planning, and taking charge.\nIn January, OpenAI took a step toward that future by letting the public in on another experiment: its long-awaited Operator service, a so-called agentic AI that can act well beyond the chatbot window. Operator can click and type on websites just as a person would to execute chores like booking a trip or filling out a form. For the moment, it performs these tasks much more slowly and cautiously than a human would, and at a steep cost for its unreliability (available as part of a $200 monthly plan). Google, naturally, is working to bring agentic features to its coming models too. Where the current Gemini can help you develop a meal plan, the next one will place your ingredients in an online shopping cart. Maybe the one after that will give you real-time feedback on your onion-chopping technique.\nAs always, moving quickly may mean gaffing often. In late January, before the Super Bowl, Google released an ad in which Gemini was caught in a slipup even more laughably wrong than Bard’s telescope mistake: It estimated that half or more of all the cheese consumed on Earth is gouda. As Gemini grows from a sometimes-credible facts machine to an intimate part of human lives—life coach, all-seeing assistant—Pichai says that Google is proceeding cautiously. Back on top at last, though, he and the other Google executives may never want to get caught from behind again. The race goes on.\nUpdated 3/21/2025, 4 PM EDT: Wired has clarified the context of a quote attributed to Pandu Nayak.\nLet us know what you think about this article.

    "content_text": "On a Friday afternoon in mid-March, a bunch of (presumably) non-hackers showed up to participate in a new kind of “hackathon.” It was Pi Day, so pie was served, but the mood wasn’t celebratory. Students, researchers, and members of the wider public health community were there, in a lecture hall at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and on Zoom, to rescue data. Whatever they could. According to the flier for the Preserving Public Health Data Hackathon, the current Trump administration was trying to undermine research on everything from climate change to systemic racism, and saving data from government websites meant it would be archived and republished in the event federal agencies tried to remove it. The antiauthoritarian theme came up often: don’t obey in advance.\nEveryone in the room and on the Zoom got a crash course in identifying at-risk information, collecting it, and storing it once they did. Backing up certain pieces seemed critical.\nFor those who work in public health, protecting research pertaining to gender identity and diversity issues has been a focus since the inauguration. Last year, then-candidate Trump repeated a lot of anti-trans rhetoric on the campaign trail, and in the first weeks of his presidency signed executive orders essentially barring transgender people from serving in the military, proclaiming that the US government would only recognize “two genders, male and female,” threatening to withhold federal funds in what is an attempt to bar trans women from sports, and attempting to block gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19. Since Trump’s inauguration, hundreds of words—from “transgender” to “Latinx” to “accessible”—have been removed from federal agencies’ websites. In early February, thousands of websites went missing as agencies raced to comply with the executive orders.\nIn recent weeks, the targeting of gender-related material has become even starker, after Trump told a joint session of Congress that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had uncovered that the federal government had spent $8 million on “making mice transgender” (it hasn’t), and the Department of Defense performed a purge of “DEI” materials that included flagging, but ultimately not removing, images of the Enola Gay.\nOne particular dataset, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (commonly shortened to YRBS), seems particularly at-risk, notes Ariel Beccia, an epidemiologist at the Chan School’s LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence. The YRBS, which tracks scores of health-related issues in young people, is one of the only nationally representative surveys that regularly collects data on transgender kids. Beccia and other public health researchers fear the information in the YRBS may not be available forever.\nAnd even if the YRBS can be backed up, the integrity of its data can’t be completely protected from the influence of the new administration. President Trump’s recent moves have also left some in public service afraid to participate in new research, like this year’s survey. “Because of this ‘comply in advance’ strategy, school boards are hesitant to participate in the YRBS,” Beccia told attendees at the hackathon.\nBeccia would know. Her research focuses on race and ethnicity as well as LGBTQ+ young people. She’s recently been looking into LGTBQ+ inequities in eating disorders. Her work relies on YRBS data. Now that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which hosts the survey’s results, has reportedly stopped processing data on trans Americans, and fewer schools are participating, the data Beccia uses, even if it stays online, will be incomplete.\nWhen asked about this, CDC spokesperson Melissa Dibble confirmed that, in compliance with Trump’s executive orders, “the transgender identity question was removed from the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey,” but no other changes were made. Dibble added that the change shouldn’t delay the survey’s results.\nIt’s created a “double whammy” situation, Beccia says, where government employees are trying to comply with Trump’s executive orders and school districts are afraid to participate in any study related to gender or LGBTQ+ health, even if it is data that in turn guides how they run their schools.\n“We are living through a pretty scary time with the administration,” Beccia tells me a few days after the event. “This is obviously impacting the mental health of everyone in the country, especially queer and trans people and queer and trans youth, and we’re not going to have data on this.”\nThe YRBS is just one of many datasets researchers have sought to shore up in a long-running effort to preserve government-funded information as the new administration takes control. The University of Washington Information School held “Data Rescue” events in January aimed at collecting climate crisis information. The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI), a network of research professionals that launched a tool during Trump’s first term to track changes to environmental information on federal websites, relaunched that tracker at the beginning of March. The Data Rescue Project, a consortium of data-rescue organizations, lists dozens of ways people can get involved if they want to help collect. A group of archivists has recreated the pre-Inauguration Day version of the CDC website and is now hosting it in Europe at RestoredCDC.org.\nOther organizations are also looking to back up the YRBS, too. On January 30, soon after Trump signed the first of his executive orders aimed at trans Americans, Libby Hemphill, director of the Resource Center for Minority Data at The Inter-University Consortium of Political and Social Research (ICPSR), started getting calls. Word had gotten out that the CDC might be scrubbing data, including the YRBS, and people wanted to know how to stop it. Hemphill gathered some colleagues and started scraping it. Then there were requests for data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), from the Department of Education, from the National Institutes of Health.\nMuch like the data-preservation effort at the Chan School, Hemphill and her team coordinated ways for people to submit data they wanted to preserve and ways for researchers to collect it and store it. The ICPSR runs a repository known as DataLumos, where a lot of the preservation efforts are backing up their collections. When I ask Hemphill if she’s worried about the safety of the information in the DataLumos archive, she says “it’s absolutely something that we think about,” adding, “I can assure you that ICPSR has a non-US physical, non-US regulatory plan for data preservation.”\nIf you think this sounds familiar, you’re not wrong. When Trump assumed the presidency in 2017, scientists, archivists, and librarians at the University of Pennsylvania raced to save data published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and NOAA. Another group in Michigan, also fearing the EPA and NOAA websites would lose valuable information, made a similar move. Websites were backed up to the Internet Archive; large datasets were “bagged” for safe keeping.\nAt the time, the researchers weren’t sure the incoming administration would seek to erase any info. It was more like a hunch, one that proved prescient when, then being led by Trump appointee and agency administrator Scott Pruitt, the EPA began removing climate change information from its website in April 2017, “to reflect the approach of new leadership.”\nBetween 2017 and 2021, more than 1,400 pages related to climate change on government web sites were altered or made less accessible, according to data compiled by the EDGI. That, notes Gretchen Gehrke, who leads EDGI’s website monitoring program, is not “a comprehensive list of changes,” since some alterations—like removing “Climate Change” from the navigation page of EPA.gov—only get counted once but affect several other pages.\n“I think there is a lot more awareness about the precarity of federal information after having experienced the first Trump administration,” Gehrke says. “Watching the Trump campaign become truly obsessed with trans people, and knowing the Trump administration’s history of information suppression, people were and are rightly concerned that that information is at risk.”\nWhich is why Beccia is concerned. Datasets like those in the YRBS are few and far between and losing it could be disastrous to those wanting to know about the health and well-being of trans youth in America.\nAlthough the YRBS is currently live on the CDC’s website, it did briefly disappear, along with data on the Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services web sites, earlier this year following an order from the Office of Personnel Management that it be scrubbed to comply with Trump’s executive orders.\nThe information returned in mid-February when US District Judge John Bates, responding to a lawsuit from Doctors for America, granted a temporary restraining order and the site was reinstated. A disclaimer at the top of the YRBS page now says “any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate,” adding “this page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the administration and this department rejects it.”\nTazlina Mannix worked for the YRBS program in Alaska from 2015 until 2023, both as survey coordinator and data manager. She notes that even if the CDC keeps the data online, disclaimers like the one on the site now make it harder for researchers to do their work. Collecting public health data relies on relationships with people in health departments and school districts. Giving those people any reason to hesitate can “set you back to zero,” she says. “When I first saw [that disclaimer], I was so horrified. The language is so extreme, and it’s also just wrong.”",

    "content_text": "On Thursday, Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Services Administration, hosted his first all-hands meeting with GSA staff since his appointment to the position by President Donald Trump. The auditorium was packed, with hundreds of employees attending the meeting in person and thousands more tuning in online. While the tone of the live event remained polite, the chat that accompanied the live stream was a different story.\n“‘My door is always open’ but we’ve been told we can’t go to the floor you work on?” wrote one employee, according to Google Meet chat logs for the event obtained by WIRED. Employees used their real names to ask questions, but WIRED has chosen not to include those names to protect the privacy of the staffers. “We don’t want an AI demo, we want answers to what is going on with [reductions in force],” wrote another, as over 100 GSA staffers added a “thumbs up” emoji to the post.\nBut an AI demo is what they got. During the meeting, Ehikian and other high-ranking members of the GSA team showed off GSAi, a chatbot tool built by employees at the Technology Transformation Services. In its current form, the bot is meant to help employees with mundane tasks like writing emails. But Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been pushing for a more complex version that could eventually tap into government databases. Roughly 1,500 people have access to GSAi today, and by tomorrow, the bot will be deployed to more than 13,000 GSA employees, WIRED has learned.\nMusk associates—including Ehikian and Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer who now runs the Technology Transformation Services within GSA—have put AI at the heart of their agenda. Yesterday, GSA hosted a media roundtable to show its AI tool to reporters. “All information shared during this event is on deep background—attributable to a ‘GSA official familiar with the development of the AI tool,’” an invite read. (Reporters from Bloomberg, The Atlantic, and Fox were invited. WIRED was not.)\nGSA was one of the first federal agencies Musk’s allies took over in late January, WIRED reported. Ehikian, who is married to a former employee of Elon Musk’s X, works alongside Shedd and Nicole Hollander, who slept in Twitter HQ as an unofficial member of Musk’s transition team at the company. Hollander is partners with Steve Davis, who has taken a leading role at DOGE. More than 1,835 GSA employees have taken a deferred resignation offer since the leadership change, as DOGE continues its push to reportedly “right-size” the federal workforce. Employees who remain have been told to return to the office five days a week. Their credit cards—used for everything from paying for software tools to buying equipment for work—have a spending limit of $1.\nEmployees at the all-hands meeting—anxious to hear about whether more people will lose their jobs and why they’ve lost access to critical software tools—were not pleased. \"We are very busy after losing people and this is not [an] efficient use of time,” one employee wrote. “Literally who cares about this,” wrote another.\n“When there are great tools out there, GSA’s job is to procure them, not make mediocre replacements,” a colleague added.\n“Did you use this AI to organize the [reduction in force]?” asked another federal worker.\n“When will the Adobe Pro be given back to us?” said another. “This is a critical program that we use daily. Please give this back or at least a date it will be back.”\nEmployees also pushed back against the return-to-office mandate. “How does [return to office] increase collaboration when none of our clients, contractors, or people on our [integrated product teams] are going to be in the same office?” a GSA worker asked. “We’ll still be conducting all work over email or Google meetings.”\nOne employee asked Ehikian who the DOGE team at GSA actually is. “There is no DOGE team at GSA,” Ehikian responded, according to two employees with direct knowledge of the events. Employees, many of whom have seen DOGE staff at GSA, didn’t buy it. “Like we didn’t notice a bunch of young kids working behind a secure area on the sixth floor,” one employee told WIRED. Luke Farritor, a young former SpaceX intern who has worked at DOGE since the organization’s earliest days, was seen wearing sunglasses inside the GSA office in recent weeks, as was Ethan Shaotran, another young DOGE worker who recently served as president of the Harvard mountaineering club. A GSA employee described Shaotran as “grinning in a blazer and T-shirt.”\nGSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by WIRED.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Do you know anything about these dinners and meetings? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at zoeschiffer.87.\nDuring the meeting, Ehikian showed off a slide detailing GSA’s goals—right-sizing, streamline operations, deregulation, and IT innovation—alongside current cost-savings. “Overall costs avoided” were listed at $1.84 billion. The number of employees using generative AI tools built by GSA was listed at 1,383. The number of hours saved from automations was said to be 178,352. Ehikian also pointed out that the agency has canceled or reduced 35,354 credit cards used by government workers and terminated 683 leases. (WIRED cannot confirm any of these statistics. DOGE has been known to share misleading and inaccurate statistics regarding its cost saving efforts.)\n“Any efficiency calculation needs a denominator,” a GSA employee wrote in the chat. “Cuts can reduce expenses, but they can also reduce the value delivered to the American public. How is that captured in the scorecard?”\nIn a slide titled “The Road Ahead,” Ehikian laid out his vision for the future. “Optmize federal real estate portfolio,” read one pillar. “Centralize procurement,” read another. Sub categories included “reduce compliance burden to increase competition,” “centralize our data to be accessible across teams,” and “Optimize GSA’s cloud and software spending.”\nOnline, employees seemed leery. “So, is Stephen going to restrict himself from working on any federal contracts after his term as GSA administrator, especially with regard to AI and IT software?” asked one employee in the chat. There was no answer.",

    "content_text": "Last year, we reported on an exciting hint of new physics in the first data analysis results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)—namely that the dark energy, rather than being constant, might vary over time. Granted, those hints were still below the necessary threshold to claim discovery and hence fell under the rubric of “huge, if true.”\nBut now we have more data from DESI, combined with other datasets, and those hints have gotten significantly stronger—so much so that Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas, who co-chairs one of the DESI working groups, said that “we are getting to the point of no return” for confirming dynamical dark energy. Ishak-Boushaki and several other DESI team members presented their results at the American Physical Society’s Global Physics Summit today in Anaheim, California. Several relevant papers have also been posted to the physics arXiv.\nEinstein’s cosmological constant (lambda) implied the existence of a repulsive form of gravity. (For a more in-depth discussion of the history of the cosmological constant and its significance for dark energy, see our 2024 story.) Quantum physics holds that even the emptiest vacuum is teeming with energy in the form of “virtual” particles that wink in and out of existence, flying apart and coming together in an intricate quantum dance. This roiling sea of virtual particles could give rise to dark energy, giving the universe a little extra push so that it can continue accelerating. The problem is that the quantum vacuum contains too much energy: roughly 10120 times too much.\nSo the universe should be accelerating much faster than it is if the dark energy is, essentially, the cosmological constant. Still, all the observations to date indicate that it’s constant. The best theoretical fit thus far is known as the Lambda CDM model, which incorporates both a weakly interacting cold dark matter and dark energy. One alternative theory proposes that the universe may be filled with a fluctuating form of dark energy dubbed “quintessence.” There are also several other alternative models that assume the density of dark energy has varied over the history of the universe.\nIn its earliest days, the universe was a hot, dense soup of subatomic particles, including hydrogen and helium nuclei, aka baryons. Tiny fluctuations created a rippling pattern through that early ionized plasma, which froze into a three-dimensional place as the universe expanded and cooled. Those ripples, or bubbles, are known as baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). It’s possible to use BAOs as a kind of cosmic ruler to investigate the effects of dark energy over the history of the universe.\nThat’s what DESI was designed to do: take precise measurements of the apparent size of these bubbles (both near and far) by determining the distances to galaxies and quasars over 11 billion years. That data can then be sliced into chunks to determine how fast the universe was expanding at each point of time in the past, the better to model how dark energy was affecting that expansion.\nAn Upward Trend\nLast year’s results were based on analysis of a full year’s worth of data taken from seven different slices of cosmic time and include 450,000 quasars, the largest ever collected, with a record-setting precision of the most distant epoch (between 8 to 11 billion years back) of 0.82 percent. While there was basic agreement with the Lamba CDM model, when those first-year results were combined with data from other studies (involving the cosmic microwave background radiation and Type Ia supernovae), some subtle differences cropped up.\nEssentially, those differences suggested that the dark energy might be getting weaker. In terms of confidence, the results amounted to a 2.6-sigma level for the DESI’s data combined with CMB datasets. When adding the supernovae data, those numbers grew to 2.5-sigma, 3.5-sigma, or 3.9-sigma levels, depending on which particular supernova dataset was used.\nIt's important to combine the DESI data with other independent measurements because “we want consistency,” said DESI co-spokesperson Will Percival of the University of Waterloo. “All of the different experiments should give us the same answer to how much matter there is in the universe at present day, how fast the universe is expanding. It’s no good if all the experiments agree with the Lambda-CDM model, but then give you different parameters. That just doesn't work. Just saying it’s consistent to the Lambda-CDM, that’s not enough in itself. It has to be consistent with Lambda-CDM and give you the same parameters for the basic properties of that model.”\nThese latest results cover the first three years of collected data, spanning almost 15 million galaxies and quasars. Once again, the DESI data alone was consistent with Lambda CDM, i.e., the dark energy is constant. And once again, when combined with other datasets—from CMB, supernovae, and weak gravitational lensing studies—strong hints emerged that dark energy might be changing over time. The confidence level ranges from 2.8 to 4.2 sigma, depending on the combination of datasets—just shy of the five-sigma threshold.\nThis might strike the average citizen as an incremental advance, but the reality is more complicated. “The DESI data itself is not incremental,” said Percival. “We now have three years of data rather than one year of data. That is substantial, not just because of an increased area but because we’ve increased the overlap. The way we do the survey is we build up plates on the sky, and, after three years rather than one year of operations, we have a lot more of those overlaps filled in. So our data is a lot more complete in the sense that we’ve gone down to the full depth that we expect to get to in more patches. Consequently, our BAO measurements themselves are a lot better. They’re between a factor of two and three better depending on exactly this balance between area versus depth.”\nCatherine Heymans, astronomer royal of Scotland, told Ars that these new results give scientists much more confidence in DESI’s analysis. She was surprised at the excitement over last year's first results, since, “whenever there’s a first data release, the scientific community always takes the results with a pinch of salt,” she said. But DESI made its data public, and other scientists have been making their own analyses over the last year; it has stood up to that close scrutiny.\n“The really strong significance for dynamical dark energy comes from the combination of the DESI standard ruler, the BAO plus the supernova data,” she added. “That’s two different ways of measuring the expansion rate of the universe. By combining those two things together, you get this strong detection of dynamical dark energy.”\nThe next step for the DESI collaboration is to analyze five years’ worth of data to see if the upward trend toward the 5-sigma threshold for discovery holds—perhaps even surpassing that threshold, which would be very exciting indeed. That will likely not happen for another two years, per Percival. Should 5 sigma be reached, Heymans said astronomers should expect to see similar results in data from the Euclid Space Telescope, which is slated to do a similar experiment to DESI, at higher redshift, in the near future.\n“It opens up a huge range of possibilities,” said Percival of the implications should it be confirmed that dark energy changes over time. “It will keep theorists happy for many years to come. As a scientist you want to sit a little bit on the fence. But if this is right, this is the next step after the discovery of dark energy. Lambda works. Now, Lambda doesn’t work. It means there’s a lot more information that’s accessible about this process. I think people were worried that everything would show that it just exactly agrees with Lambda. But if there’s actually things happening to how the acceleration is changing within detail, that’s exciting because we can get a handle on the physics.”\n“There’s no fundamental underpinning for what could be causing that dynamical dark energy, and that does make me anxious,” said Heymans. “It’s like the observers are throwing the gauntlet back to the theorists. It’d be nice to be able to explain two dark entities with one fell swoop. I am excited about cracks in the cosmological model, because this way is pushing the theoretical community to think outside the box, to think of new ideas. And maybe that will solve the whole dark entity conundrum, which is why we’re all here.”\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",
    "content_html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body__inner-container\"><p class=\"paywall\">That’s what DESI was designed to do: take precise measurements of the apparent size of these bubbles (both near and far) by determining the distances to galaxies and quasars over 11 billion years. That data can then be sliced into chunks to determine how fast the universe was expanding at each point of time in the past, the better to model how dark energy was affecting that expansion.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">An Upward Trend</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Last year’s results were based on analysis of a full year’s worth of data taken from seven different slices of cosmic time and include 450,000 quasars, the largest ever collected, with a record-setting precision of the most distant epoch (between 8 to 11 billion years back) of 0.82 percent. While there was basic agreement with the Lamba CDM model, when those first-year results were combined with data from other studies (involving the cosmic microwave background radiation and Type Ia supernovae), some subtle differences cropped up.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Essentially, those differences suggested that the dark energy might be getting weaker. In terms of confidence, the results amounted to a 2.6-sigma level for the DESI’s data combined with CMB datasets. When adding the supernovae data, those numbers grew to 2.5-sigma, 3.5-sigma, or 3.9-sigma levels, depending on which particular supernova dataset was used.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It's important to combine the DESI data with other independent measurements because “we want consistency,” said DESI co-spokesperson Will Percival of the University of Waterloo. “All of the different experiments should give us the same answer to how much matter there is in the universe at present day, how fast the universe is expanding. It’s no good if all the experiments agree with the Lambda-CDM model, but then give you different parameters. That just doesn't work.

    "content_text": "According to a memo circulating among State Department staff and reviewed by WIRED, the Trump administration plans to rename the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as US International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA), and to bring it directly under the secretary of state. The document, on which Politico first reported, states that as part of its reorganization, the agency will “leverage blockchain technology” as part of its procurement process.\n“All distributions would also be secured and traced via blockchain technology to radically increase security, transparency, and traceability,” the memo reads. “This approach would encourage innovation and efficiency among implementing partners and allow for more flexible and responsive programming focused on tangible impact rather than simply completing activities and inputs.”\nThe memo does not make clear what specifically this means—if it would encompass doing cash transfers in some kind of cryptocurrency or stablecoin, for example, or simply mean using a blockchain ledger to track aid disbursement.\nThe memo comes as staffers at USAID are trying to understand their future. The agency was an early target of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has effectively been headed by centibillionaire Elon Musk. Shortly after President Trump’s inauguration, the State Department put the entire agency’s staff on administrative leave, slashed its workforce, and halted a portion of payments to partner organizations around the world, including those doing lifesaving work. Since then a federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the dismantling of the agency, but the memo appears to indicate that the administration has plans to continue its mission of drastically cutting USAID and fully folding it into the State Department.\nThe plans for the blockchain have also caught staffers off guard.\nFew blockchain-based projects have managed to achieve large-scale use in the humanitarian sector. Linda Raftree, a consultant who helps humanitarian organizations adopt new technology, says there’s a reason for that—the incorporation of blockchain technology is often unnecessary.\n“It feels like a fake technological solution for a problem that doesn’t exist,” she says. “I don’t think we were ever able to find an instance where people were using blockchain where they couldn’t use existing tools.”\nGiulio Coppi, a senior humanitarian officer at the nonprofit Access Now who has researched the use of blockchain in humanitarian work, says that blockchain technologies, while sometimes effective, offer no obvious advantages over other tools organizations could use, such as an existing payments system or another database tool. “There’s no proven advantage that it’s cheaper or better,” he says. “The way it’s been presented is this tech solutionist approach that has been proven over and over again to not have any substantial impact in reality.”\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82.\nThere have been, however, some successful instances of using blockchain technology in the humanitarian sector. In 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) ran a small pilot to give cash assistance to Ukrainians displaced by the Russia-Ukraine war in a stablecoin. Other pilots have been tested in Kenya by the Kenya Red Cross Society. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which works with the Kenya team, also helped to develop the Humanitarian Token Solution (HTS).\nOne representative from an NGO that uses blockchain technology, but wasn’t authorized to speak to the media with regards to issues relating to USAID, says that particularly with regards to money transfers, stablecoins can be faster and easier than other methods of reaching communities impacted by a disaster. However, “introducing new systems means you’re setting up a new burden” for the many organizations that USAID partners with, they say. “The relative cost of new systems is harder for small NGOs,” which would often include the kind of local organizations that would be at the front line of response to disasters.\nThe proposed adoption of blockchain technology seems related to an emphasis on exerting tight controls over aid. The memo seems, for example, to propose that funding should be contingent on outcomes, reading, “Tying payment to outcomes and results rather than inputs would ensure taxpayer dollars deliver maximum impact.” A USAID employee, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the media, says that many of USAID’s contracts already function this way, with organizations being paid after performing their work. However, that’s not possible in all situations. “Those kinds of agreements are often not flexible enough for the environments we work in,” they say, noting that in conflict or disaster zones, situations can change quickly, meaning that what an organization may be able to do or need to do can fluctuate.\nRaftree says this language appears to be misleading, and bolsters claims made by Musk and the administration that USAID was corrupt. “It’s not like USAID was delivering tons of cash to people who hadn’t done things,” she says.",

I'm like, \"Oh, no, my parents call me Zoe. Don't worry about it.\"\nLauren Goode: Oh. Right, right. Like Zooey Deschanel, she has the Y, right? Yeah, okay.\nMichael Calore: But she's Zooey.\nLauren Goode: I never thought about that before.\nMichael Calore: Isn't she? Isn't she Zooey?\nLauren Goode: No, she's Zooey.\nZoë Schiffer: Like Franny and Zooey is spelled Zooey but it's Zooey, Franny and Zooey. Anyway, Mike, what do your parents, what did they call you when you were little?\nLauren Goode: She's deflecting really hard. She doesn't want to tell us the real nickname.\nZoë Schiffer: I can't. I just feel like I already have too much imposter syndrome.\nMichael Calore: For a very long time, my mother referred to me by my full name, Michael, and so did my father.\nLauren Goode: What's your middle name?\nMichael Calore: Seth.\nLauren Goode: Did they call you Michael Seth?\nMichael Calore: On very, very rare occasions.\nZoë Schiffer: Seth really could be your first name, too. I feel like that almost fits.\nLauren Goode: Oh, yeah. You're a Seth.\nMichael Calore: Do I present as Seth?\nZoë Schiffer: A little bit. Seth rising, if you will.\nMichael Calore: Okay.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Seth goes to a lot of live music shows. Yeah.\nMichael Calore: Seth's a guy, you know? What about you, Lauren?\nLauren Goode: My name is Lauren Goode.\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: I have a hard time pronouncing my name. You know this from years of doing podcasts with me. Whenever it comes to that moment of I'm Lauren Goode.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Sometimes when I got to order coffee, they ask for my name, they end up writing it M because I struggle to say the L. I feel like I should just change my name.\nMichael Calore: What do you think your psyche is telling you?\nLauren Goode: When I was a kid, sometimes my mom called me Wren.\nZoë Schiffer: Oh.\nLauren Goode: I feel like I should be a Wren.\nZoë Schiffer: I really like that. I think that's a sweet name.\nMichael Calore: Wren.\nZoë Schiffer: I feel if we were at the Joe Rogan Podcast, which we're all devout listeners of, we would be asking Grok right now what your name should be, and then you would be called that for the rest of time.\nLauren Goode: Or just be Wren. But the thing with Wren Goode is it's two really hard single-syllable words.\nMichael Calore: That's true.\nZoë Schiffer: What's your middle name?\nLauren Goode: Margaret.\nMichael Calore: It's like a spondee, though, Wren Goode.\nLauren Goode: Wren Goode, it is kind of cool. Wren Margaret. Maybe I should just be Wren Margaret. Now if anyone really wants to dox me. Would you like my social security number? They're all going to be public soon anyway.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. Let's talk through your birthday.\nLauren Goode: Right. Some 19-year-old currently has my social security number, so great.\nMichael Calore: Okay. Well, here is a more topical question. What do you think Elon Musk's mom calls him?\nZoë Schiffer: Little E.\nLauren Goode: Oh. I don't know. Maybe?\nZoë Schiffer: He did actually take over the @E handle shortly before he bought Twitter. A little scoop for you. I don't know what nickname she calls him, but I do think it's funny that she's been like, “It's insulting to call him a billionaire. He is the genius of the world and should be recognized as such.”\nMichael Calore: That's some strong mom energy. This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. Today we're talking about Maye Musk. She's a model, influencer, and an author of the memoir A Woman Makes a Plan. She's been traveling to some notable places this year to promote her work and to rep her son, Elon Musk. Who is Maye Musk? What do you need to know about her? And how much influence does she currently have over US politics? I am Michael Seth Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: I'm Wren Goode, senior writer at WIRED. Oh, that was easy.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: I'm Zoë Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nMichael Calore: With an umlaut.\nZoë Schiffer: With an umlaut. I almost said Zoe and I was like, it's too many bits for us.\nMichael Calore: Let's get started with the big question. Who is Maye Musk?\nLauren Goode: Maye is an entrepreneur, and a model, and a dietician, and an author in her own right. I think she's probably best known for being a model. She's been a model from a young age and continues to model into her late seventies. She's also the author of a book called A Woman Makes a Plan. This came out in 2019, but it continues to be popular, particularly because it's popular in China, where it was translated into Chinese the year after it came out. She was born in Canada. She was raised mostly in South Africa, which is where she started modeling. She was 15 then, and she was a finalist in the Miss South Africa contest.\nMichael Calore: Hey, mazel tov.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. This is also where she got married, she had kids, and then divorced. She's got three kids. In addition to Elon, there's Kimbal, who I think a lot of people have also heard of, and Tosca. It sounds like a cookie, doesn't it? I'd love some Tosca with my tea.\nZoë Schiffer: She would never have a cookie. Her mom talks constantly about no cookies.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Wow. Fascinating. She ended up moving to California in 1996, when her two sons started the software company that gave Elon his start. It was called Zip2. Now she bounces around the world. She's a citizen of the world, this is partly because of Elon and partly it's because it's where her work takes her. One note that's interesting about her modeling career is that she's become an advocate or representation for people of all ages and sizes. The fact that she's an older woman and still has these makeup and beauty product endorsements says a lot about her durability as an entrepreneur and as a model. In 2022, she was also the oldest woman to appear on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition.\nZoë Schiffer: It was a good cover.\nLauren Goode: Which I think then, she was later maybe surpassed by Martha Stewart.\nMichael Calore: Oh, really?\nZoë Schiffer: Interesting.\nLauren Goode: Martha Stewart was 81—\nZoë Schiffer: Oh my gosh.\nLauren Goode: ... when she graced the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.\nZoë Schiffer: The term dietician always gives me pause. What is …\nLauren Goode: That's a really good question about her dietician career, Zoë. She studied nutrition, or she calls it dietetics, from a young age. But it was after she got divorced, she was around 31, that's when she had to build up her own practice. She has said that she was, at one point, seeing up to 25 patients or clients a day while modeling. Zoë, would you call this extremely hardcore?\nZoë Schiffer: I would say that's extremely hardcore.\nLauren Goode: These days, she's doing a lot of speaking engagements that are often geared towards women. Women's empowerment, beauty, health. And also, parenting, because we're going to keep coming back to this, she has a very famous son.\nMichael Calore: Yes, she does. We all know about Elon's influence and how important he is in our world, and now in the larger world of the United States government and the world stage. But what is Maye's own personal influence? How does she move the needle around the world?\nZoë Schiffer: She has a really big social presence. I think she's got about 1.5 million followers on Instagram, where she posts a lot about her family. I think one recent video, the voice-over was like, “As the mother of three billionaires.” I was like, okay. But she also has 1.4 million followers on Twitter. And as Lauren mentioned, she's got her book, she's a model. She's an influencer in China, which we can get into later. Her profile has grown alongside Elon's.\nMichael Calore: Right. She's been in the news lately for a lot of reasons, and we'll get into those later, as you mentioned. One of the most obvious is that she is Elon Musk's mother and Elon Musk has been in the news, so she has also been in the news, too. Let's talk about the two of them and what their relationship is like.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. By all accounts, Lauren, I'm curious to get your take, but it seems like they have a pretty tight relationship. Elon famously is estranged from his father, Maye's ex-husband. When I was reporting my book about Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, I would talk to executives who would say, “Yeah, we sat down for this very high-level meeting, and inexplicably Elon had brought his mom along.” Everyone was like, “What is she doing here?” She would pipe in and give her suggestions. People found it to be pretty odd, according to the conversations that I had with them. She also is known for going head-to-head with reporters and other people online who are critical of her son. One recent example was that CNN did a panel after Elon Musk appeared at Trump's inauguration in January. Then implied that he had done a Nazi-like salute. Maye was out there, suggesting that he'd simply sue CNN for that coverage.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. There was this moment back in 2022 when it was shortly after Elon had announced the Twitter acquisition. His tweets started getting a little bit bizarre. Because a lot of these business negotiations were happening out in public. As a result, people were responding to his tweets. One of his crusades was against spambots. Maye took it upon herself to start calling people out on Twitter who she identified to be spambots or in other ways disingenuous. She was using the hashtag #nasty. She would put nasty, nasty. At one point she quote-tweeted someone and she said, “Is this a bot or a troll? 16 followers, nearly 2000 likes, makes you think. #nastynasty.” She waged this one-woman campaign to be like, “Hey, one, I'm highlighting spam on the platform, which is something that my son is currently investigating. Two, stop picking on Elon.”\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: I find this so relatable. She's just being such a mom. But the, “No matter how rich and influential my son is, I'm still going to be out there defending him to critics on Twitter, including to accounts that might be bots and have 16 followers,” is so funny. I'm like, “Yeah. Me, too, girl.”\nMichael Calore: I do think it's kind of sweet, the way that they pay attention to each other a lot in public. They show up to events together. She's a model, she's a very glamorous dresser. She always appears very well put together. And she dresses up, I would say better than he does.\nZoë Schiffer: Not hard.\nMichael Calore: Absolutely no shade at all. I'm wearing a camo hat right now, and I have an unbuttoned flannel over a branded T-shirt. But she does, she dresses up very well. They appear together at events. At galas, at dinners, and things like that, in formal wear.\nLauren Goode: Right.\nMichael Calore: I think it's kind of sweet.\nZoë Schiffer: Totally.\nLauren Goode: This is actually another great anecdote from Issacson's book, which is that they went to the Met Gala.\nZoë Schiffer: Right.\nLauren Goode: Which is, of course, run by our boss here at Condé Nast, Anna Wintour. All of us, of course, have been invited to the Met Gala, we just haven't been able to make it yet.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, a conflict.\nLauren Goode: Yes. Scheduling conflicts. Elon and Maye were invited. Apparently he got out of a meeting at about 9:00 pm, but they had to show up at the Met Gala.\nZoë Schiffer: Wow. Well, this is the sweet segment of the show. I feel like we have to talk about some of the potential issues with Maye Musk's profile around the world. But let it be said that we had a whole segment where we talked about how charming it is that they love each other apparently.\nMichael Calore: Yes. Yeah. On that note, let's all hold onto those feelings while we take a break, and we'll come right back.\n[break]\nMichael Calore: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. Maye Musk has been traveling all over the world. Most notably, she's been going to places like China and the United Arab Emirates. Why is she going to these places?\nLauren Goode: Well, Maye Musk is in the business of being Maye Musk. She's known as a silver-haired influencer in China. In China in particular, she's got a lot of product endorsement ties. Makeup, massagers, clothing. She does a lot of speaking engagements. I think in order to really understand her presence there, we should take a look at this ad that ran sometime in 2024. She's tied to a brand called Babycare.\n[Archival audio]: (Singing) I look up and think about the new.\nLauren Goode: The rest of the ad is in Mandarin, but there are English subtitles.\n[Archival audio]: (Ad playing in Mandarin)\nLauren Goode: She's asking, “How do you raise successful kids?” It's Maye, just cruising through the streets, looking as elegant as ever. With beautiful scenery of children playing in the street and everything.\nZoë Schiffer: Wow.\nLauren Goode: There's a little girl dancing. It's very cute.\nZoë Schiffer: Wait, I love this ad.\nMichael Calore: The messaging here is that you shouldn't tell kids to be quiet, and sit down and do what they're told. You should tell them to be loud. You should tell them to get up and run. You should tell them to disobey authority. To be themselves.\nZoë Schiffer: Let kids grow up free.\nLauren Goode: Free-range kids.\nZoë Schiffer: Don't obey the rules.\n[Archival audio]: (Ad playing in Mandarin)\nLauren Goode: What's interesting about this too, is that in Issacson's biography of Musk, he writes about how Maye herself grew up where her parents took a lot of risks. They are free-range children. It is in their family DNA in a sense, to have these risk-taking, courageous kids.\nZoë Schiffer: Not to make this all about my kids always, but I tend to raise very free kids, let them do what they want within the bounds of reason. The result is that my 3-year-old hasn't washed her hair in four weeks. I don't know if I'm benefiting in the way that Maye Musk seems to believe is possible.\nMichael Calore: If you're watching Chinese television, you'll see this ad. You'll have very warm and affectionate feelings toward Maye Musk and her famous children. Joking aside, she is an influential person in China. Why does that influence concern some?\nZoë Schiffer: We're just at a very interesting moment with diplomatic relations with China. We're in a Cold War, some have called it, related to AI and it raises a number of concerns. For example, foreign governments could conceivably use Maye Musk as a way to try to get close to Elon, and thereby Trump, almost to exert control on the current administration. That's just something to pay attention to. There's fears that her phone could be hacked while she is there.\nMichael Calore: Oh.\nZoë Schiffer: She was riding on Air Force One recently. While these are purely theoretical, the stakes are pretty high. There's worry that foreign governments could try and curry favor with her by asking her to model or be a brand ambassador for various companies. There's, again, no evidence that this has happened with her current relationships with brands overseas, but something to pay attention to. They could retaliate if the US government does something they don't like, by pulling her books off shelves or canceling contracts. Then there's this more far-fetched, but very problematic issue, which is in a worse case scenario where China was retaliating against the US for something that the US or Trump did, if Maye Musk was in China during that time, could they physically hold her there? China is known for going tit-for-tat. If a foreign government does something that China doesn't like, China will retaliate in kind. We have Marco Rubio in the administration. He is a serious China hawk. I think the fear is that the Trump Administration would do something that China doesn't like and that Maye Musk could be in the middle of this national security fiasco.\nLauren Goode: Right. It's not clear how much money she's actually making from this incredible influence that she has in China. Nor does anyone think that she's getting money from the Chinese government directly, or anything like that.\nZoë Schiffer: No.\nLauren Goode: We know that she's been to China at least four times in late 2024, The New York Times did report that. She's promoting her makeup products. Presumably, she's still promoting her book or using that as leverage for her brand, and that sort of thing. It's more about that influence. In particular, when you think about Elon's business. China is a huge market for Tesla vehicles. Tesla's largest production factory is in Shanghai. Tesla also built a large battery factory last month in Shanghai. Last year, Tesla's China sales hit a record high. Nearly 37% of its cars were delivered to customers in China. That's more than 657,000 Tesla vehicles. Elon has very vested interest in the Chinese market, and I think people are looking at some of his mother's activities there, and looking at the importance of his business there, and just wondering if there's a line to be drawn between the two of them. When Maye was in China last fall, she wrote on X, “China is so advanced in roads, tunnels, buildings, infrastructure, and ports. I'm always impressed when I visit.” Sure, you could be someone on vacation who's just, “Wow! I'm marveling at this new place that I'm in,” right?\nMichael Calore: Weird flex, but okay.\nLauren Goode: There also could be a lot of subtext there.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. I think, Lauren, your point brings up the larger issue, which is just we don't know, but there are possibilities of undue influence. I think the fact that it's not known and there's not a lot of controls in place. Normally, if someone who is close to an adviser of the president was traveling overseas, there would have been checks on their background, there would be investigations. It doesn't appear that those things have actually happened. There was a lot of security protocols that weren't followed. I think there's just, again, the possibility that something more nefarious could happen in the future.\nMichael Calore: Elon Musk has been able to sidestep a lot of the requirements for security clearance, simply because he's always taken on an advisory role in the US government, or as a contractor for the federal government. We would assume that his mother is not even anywhere on that map as well.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: As far as getting a lot of scrutiny from security clearance people.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. We don't have any evidence that she's been through that process. Judging by how the DOGE employees went about entering government, which in many cases, they were up and working in government systems before having received security clearances, yeah, I think there's reason to be suspect that she was put under that microscope for that process.\nMichael Calore: When countries invite celebrities, people who have some sort of influence on the world stage, to come visit their country and hang out, and they wine them and dine them, there is some soft diplomacy happening. “We are going to invite you here, you're going to have a great time. You're going to go back home, you're going to tell everybody about how great of a time you had, how welcoming the people were. Wouldn't it be great if we were a little bit nicer to them?” We can see that being implied in a lot of the places that she's traveling, like China. She went to Kazakhstan recently to promote her book. Maye Musk has also gone to the UAE to speak and to make appearances there. You can see, if you're inviting a Maye Musk into your world, there are implications about wanting to reach out, wanting to have a better relationship with the United States, right?\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, for sure. She's not an ambassador in the official sense, but she's playing an influential role nonetheless in the United States' relationship with these foreign governments, just by simply going there and posting about it on social media.\nLauren Goode: Totally. Yeah. In January, just before the inauguration, she did go to Dubai and she gave a talk. It was called “How I Raised Three Amazing Children, Including the Richest Man in the World.”\nMichael Calore: Oh.\nLauren Goode: What an incredible flex.\nMichael Calore: Wow.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: I was just going to say, I would have loved to have seen that talk.\nZoë Schiffer: Unironic same.\nMichael Calore: Can we tell where Maye Musk is just being a supportive mom and spreading the gospel of Elon, and can we tell where she might be doing a little bit more than that?\nLauren Goode: I tend to see Maye as a little bit of a Kris Jenner.\nMichael Calore: Ah.\nLauren Goode: Her children are very famous, and she's clearly very supportive of their careers, and will defend them to the ends of the earth. But also, she's an operator to the point where she has become her own really powerful and influential brand. There are probably a lot of ties behind the scenes that we don't have full access to. I think what everyone's going to be watching really closely is to see how those ties with China develop or evolve, and if there's any possibility that they could be exploited.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah. I would just add to that, that as her influence has grown, she's using that influence to try and preserve Elon's reputation, to try and promote his business. Again, a Kris Jenner profile. She's not just doing that as a mom, she's also doing that as someone who's very invested in his tangible success it seems like.\nMichael Calore: Well, somebody's got to look out for him.\nZoë Schiffer: So true.\nMichael Calore: Somebody really needs to step up and make sure that he remains a successful person.\nZoë Schiffer: Right.\nLauren Goode: I think that if Maye Musk ever shows up in the Oval Office and starts answering questions from reporters, then we'll have reached a new tipping point.\nMichael Calore: Do you think she'd sit on his shoulders?\nZoë Schiffer: That would be really difficult. She looks really tall.\nMichael Calore: All right. Well, let's take another break and we'll come right back.\n[break]\nMichael Calore: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. It's been a while since we have done an Overheard in Silicon Valley, so we're going to play that game this week. We're going to dish some buzz, and I only want good answers. Who wants to go first? Zoë, Lauren?\nZoë Schiffer: Wait. I feel like you might have the best tea. You were at South by Southwest.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nZoë Schiffer: You must have overheard the craziest things.\nMichael Calore: Well, it's not necessarily a crazy overheard, but there were Waymos at South by Southwest this week.\nZoë Schiffer: Wait. Is Waymo running there?\nMichael Calore: It is now, through the Uber app.\nZoë Schiffer: Oh.\nMichael Calore: They partnered with Uber.\nLauren Goode: Interesting.\nMichael Calore: When you're at South by Southwest for specific parts of Austin, you can request a Waymo through the Uber app. I did not do this because I needed to get where I was going in a quick manner, and the wait time for a Waymo was around 20, 25 minutes.\nZoë Schiffer: Oh, wow.\nMichael Calore: I just chose regular Ubers while I was there. But the company was offering rides, regularly priced rides, just like the Waymos are priced in other places where they operate through the Uber app. It was kind of interesting, kind of weird. I quizzed people about them all week when I was there, and people loved it. There were people obviously from all over the world there. Everybody was, “Oh, it was so easy and it was so nice. I was scared and I didn't know what to do, and the experience was really helpful. They hold your hands,” and all this. Then the other question that I would ask people from Austin is if they were aware that the Tesla Robotaxi service is supposed to be launching in Austin in June. Because last year, Elon Musk showed off the new Tesla Robotaxi. He said that, as part of this car's release, they're going to be launching a robotaxi service for Tesla cars.\nZoë Schiffer: Full self-driving, like Waymo-esque?\nMichael Calore: Yes. Not only will you be able to order a robotaxi to show up, a Tesla-branded robotaxi to show up, but you'll be able to, if you're a Tesla owner, put your Tesla into a pool so that your Tesla can drive around and offer people robotaxi rides while you're at the office, or sleeping, or whatever.\nLauren Goode: Passive income.\nMichael Calore: Right. He has said multiple times that this is going to be launching in Austin, Texas, in June. We're all like, “Okay.” I was asking people in Austin, “Have you heard of this?” And nobody had heard of it.\nLauren Goode: Huh.\nZoë Schiffer: Well, he famously overpromises on the delivery date of certain things.\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nZoë Schiffer: I feel like that's fair to say.\nMichael Calore: Yes. I think it will be a small miracle if there is one robotaxi ride in Austin at the very, very end of June this year.\nLauren Goode: Wait. Can I share an overheard that is related to your experience at South by Southwest, Mike?\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: Someone who we work with sent me a video and said, \"Check out Mike.\" It was you getting into a baby blue Cybertruck.\nMichael Calore: Yes.\nLauren Goode: What was happening here?\nMichael Calore: We called a Lyft, and the Lyft that showed up was a Cybertruck. When it rolled up, the guy had a wrapper on it, it was baby blue.\nZoë Schiffer: Wow. That is a shocking turn of events.\nLauren Goode: You didn't know a Cybertruck was showing up?\nMichael Calore: No. No, we did not know.\nLauren Goode: Oh my God, incredible.\nMichael Calore: Yeah, it was shocking. It was very shocking. I was like, “Well, we're getting in it,” so we got in it. We asked him about it. He was a little chatty and he told us why he bought it. He drove it out from San Diego to Austin. I asked him if anybody had vandalized his car or defaced it and he said, “Yes, somebody drew a swastika on it and wrote Nazi.” Then he wiped it off because his baby blue wrap makes it so that you can just wipe off vandalism.\nZoë Schiffer: Wow.\nLauren Goode: Did that change the way he was feeling about his Cybertruck?\nMichael Calore: I don't think so. I think he's still proud of it and still likes it.\nZoë Schiffer: Yeah, I feel like you double down if you're a Cybertruck owner. We had a recent incident earlier this week in Ventura, where a Cybertruck, I think the owner was attempting to launch a jet ski and the Cybertruck ended up in the water.\nMichael Calore: Oh, no.\nZoë Schiffer: It was being towed out of the ocean.\nLauren Goode: Oh, no!\nMichael Calore: Oh, no.\nZoë Schiffer: In footage that was circulating on social media.\nLauren Goode: When you say that, Zoë, about the Tesla being in the water and being towed out, I'm thinking of those duck boats in the Boston Harbor. Do you know what I'm talking about, Mike?\nMichael Calore: Did it float?\nLauren Goode: Did it?\nZoë Schiffer: It did not float. But we did just get a really old children's book about the duck boats in Boston.\nLauren Goode: Oh.\nZoë Schiffer: Okay, Lauren, what's your overheard?\nLauren Goode: Well, I was going to talk about vibe coding in Silicon Valley, but now I feel like I want to keep consistent with your theme.\nMichael Calore: Oh, yes.\nLauren Goode: Which is there's this little cottage industry popping up on Etsy, I noticed. If you type in just Rivian sticker, there are more than 1,000 results that come up. It's basically the sticker for people who have a Tesla but wish they had a Rivian right now.\nZoë Schiffer: Oh my gosh.\nMichael Calore: Oh, boy.\nLauren Goode: A couple episodes ago, we talked about all of Elon's babies. Now we're talking about the woman who had Elon as a baby. We talked about how the status symbol is now having three kids and a Rivian. Now we're talking about Rivians again. Honestly, I think we're just living in a simulation.\nZoë Schiffer: Okay, Elon.\nLauren Goode: Right? I would be happy to talk to more people about the simulation. Some of the stickers say, “Only driving this until I get my Rivian.” “I identify as a Rivian.” “The Anti-Elon Tesla Club,” that's a car magnet. “This Tesla does not endorse Musk.” There's a “Love the car, not the CEO.” Yeah. If you're looking for a sticker that's pro-Rivian or anti-Tesla, there are a lot of options out there right now.\nZoë Schiffer: Etsy has your back.\nMichael Calore: All right. That was some good overheard. Thank you. I feel so happy that we did that. I feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. Thanks for listening to another episode of Uncanny Valley.

I'm WIRED's Global Editorial Director, Katie Drummond. Today on the show, the difference between DOGE and official federal auditors. I'm joined today by WIRED's Vittoria Elliott, welcome to Uncanny Valley, Tori.\nVittoria Elliott: Thank you for having me.\nKatie Drummond: Happy that you're here. Now, Tori, you published a story today on WIRED about federal auditors, what they do, what makes their work fundamentally different to what DOGE is doing. And to report this story, you actually spoke to a few federal auditors. So, what does a federal auditor actually do? Because these are real jobs, prior to DOGE infiltrating federal agencies, audits were actually already happening. So, walk us through sort of what that job entails on a daily basis.\nVittoria Elliott: So, I think maybe a lot of people might have forgotten about this because everything has been moving so quickly, but one of the first moves of the new Trump Administration was to fire a bunch of inspector generals, and those are people who actually, their offices actually do these kinds of investigations. So a lot of the audits, for instance, that we think about with government programs, go through the offices of IGs. They have stuff reported to them, and then they get to look into it. So, if you're in a federal agency and you're like, this seems to be wrong, you can report that to your agency's IG, and they can go in and audit that. Audits can also be ordered by Congress if they think there's some kind of malfeasance or problems. So for instance, there was a big audit of hurricane aid during Hurricane Maria, because there was a lot of stuff that was lost. Auditors spent, I think about 18 months digging into those things. So, there are actually ways to look at particular programs in agencies and assess the spending and assess whether or not these programs are actually doing what they're meant to be doing. We have a whole system for that. And a lot of times that gets reported to Congress depending on the sensitivity of it. So, maybe if they're auditing something where we're looking at stuff that might involve classified or secret information that might not be public, but a lot of times these audits are actually also made public to Congress, you can go find them.\nKatie Drummond: Right, available to the public, as opposed to DOGE, despite the claims that Musk and even President Trump have made, that this is a maximally transparent group of people doing this work. We don't actually know that much about what they're doing, what they're finding, and the changes that they're making, short of journalists like you and so many of your WIRED colleagues and other news organizations obtaining that information and publishing it. Now, I want to back up a little bit because at the heart of all of this is this notion of fraud, of waste, of financial abuse. It's something that Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed is widespread, pervasive across government agencies that there is fraudulent spending, there is excessive waste happening. There is abuse of financial power, financial authority on the part of these agencies. Now, from what you've reported over the last several months and in your role, how valid is that claim to begin with?\nVittoria Elliott: There was a report from the government accountability office that covered the years 2018 to 2022, and that found that there's actually over $200 billion of waste, fraud, or abuse that happens. So it's like, it's not this made-up thing, but in the context of a $7 trillion federal budget, that is not what's breaking the bank. I don't think anyone, Democrat or Republican, DOGE fan or not, would argue that, hey, that's a problem that we need to solve. That's a very valuable thing. But one of the auditors that I spoke to basically said DOGE could go look at the current recommendations from the IGs. They could go look at the current outstanding investigations. They could pick up that work if they are really dedicated to this because there actually are systems, and there actually are reports about this. But from what the auditors I spoke to said, they said that doesn't really seem to be what DOGE is doing. And one of the other things they said was a lot of auditors would probably be really happy to help them, to offer advice. They'd be happy to work with them, they'd be happy to bring young talent into their teams to sort of make the auditing system more robust. But DOGE is really kind of siloed, it doesn't seem like they're really interested in that.\nKatie Drummond: Right. Now, speaking of DOGE and the auditors that you spoke to for this story, they certainly didn't have kind words to say about how DOGE is going about its work. Tell us a little bit more about their impressions of DOGE and their commentary on sort of what is happening under the auspices of this idea that Musk and DOGE are essentially auditing the federal government. What do the actual auditors think about that?\nVittoria Elliott: Yeah, so to give some context, first off, a regular audit, which involves like five different steps, so there are five steps to an audit. One is where you plan it, you sit down, you say, \"This is what we're looking at, this is the kind of information we're going to need to go after.\" You sort of map out who the stakeholders are, who you're going to have to interview, because a lot of times they're going into programs or systems that maybe they don't fully understand. So, it's almost a little ethnographic. You got to go in, you got to interview people, you got to be like, \"What is your job? What does this connect to? What does this mean inside your system?\" You have to do that baseline understanding of getting to know the program or the agency. Then you do the actual field work, which is, you go out, you talk to people. In the case of, for instance, the hurricane stuff, they actually sent auditors, I believe, to Puerto Rico to see what was going on. You go into the systems, you do that kind of human on the ground legwork. Once you've done that, they sort of pull all this information together into a report, they sort of do this analysis. They talk to the agencies, they say like, \"Hey, these are the problems we found. You have the opportunity to correct these. These are our recommendations.\" And then they submit that to the agencies, to Congress, and then they get to follow up. They get to come back and be like, \"Hey, we recommended this thing. Did you fix this problem?\" There's a level of accountability for trying to fix that thing. So, there are very clear understandings within the government of what the best practice of this is, and all of these people do that. That takes six to 18 months.\nKatie Drummond: Right, I was about to say, that sounds like a very time-consuming and extensive process to understand these systems, understand a certain part of a certain agency. Right? Remembering the federal government is massive. I mean, it's the largest employer in the country. We're talking about just huge infrastructure to sort of pick at one little piece of it would be a very time-consuming and sort of labor-intensive process if you are really doing your diligence, as you just outlined.\nVittoria Elliott: Yeah, and so what the auditors told me is, for instance, a lot of the claims that Musk and DOGE have made about the Social Security Administration, which Musk saying that 150 year olds are receiving social security checks, which our colleague David Gilbert debunked in a really smart piece. Or you know what they're saying about all this waste, fraud, and abuse within the social security system. Both these auditors said to me what that says to them is that they don't actually understand the system well enough to identify where the problems are, it seems, because obviously they're not in contact with DOGE, but they're sort of reverse engineering maybe how they're getting these conclusions, is that they're going in, they don't necessarily understand the systems. They're maybe using some form of script or keyword searching to find particular things to surface. But the reality is that it would be impossible for someone coming in from the outside to audit the entire social security system in two to three weeks.\nKatie Drummond: Right, which is to be clear, what appears to be happening.\nVittoria Elliott: Yeah. And the other thing too, is DOGE is not just \"auditing\" these systems, like going in and looking at stuff. They're canceling contracts, which also, a lot of these auditors also understand how federal contracting works because so much of the federal government's work actually goes through contracting, working with people in local areas or outsourcing stuff to the private sector. And one of the things that they really talked about as well, which we didn't get into so much in the piece, but I thought was super fascinating, is DOGE is specifically saying that it's saving the American people money, but when you cancel a contract, you're still responsible because there's a legal agreement there for paying out part of it, sometimes it's 10 to 15%. And one of the things they talked about too, is oftentimes when the government buys something, it does it in bulk so they get a discount, because if you're buying like $2 billion worth of stuff from someone, they'll give you 5, 10% off. But when you cancel that contract, you're already paying 10, 15% of what that contract might have had to be anyway to be able to cancel it. And then you're likely going to need that service again in the future, maybe in a smaller amount, but you're going to pay more for it, or you're going to pay more in time or manpower for your own team. A lot of these things that on the surface can look like large amounts of money may actually in the long run, probably not be saving very much money at all. In fact, it might be costing more.\nKatie Drummond: Right. When you're thinking about paying a kill fee, you're thinking about the time and effort, and to your point, the human resource that would go into renegotiating a contract when you realize, oops, we spent six weeks doing this \"audit,\" turns out we canceled the contract that we really need, and now we're back to the negotiation table with this supplier. And all of a sudden the price is 100% of the cost instead of 90% of the cost. Point well taken. Now, on the subject of audits, were there any specific audits that stand out as examples of this process, this sort of federal auditing process happening successfully and leading to a better outcome?\nVittoria Elliott: Yeah, I mean, the reason that I brought up the hurricane one, is because obviously the way that the government has addressed hurricane response, particularly in Puerto Rico because of its status as a territory and not a state, was really, really fraught, right? And that kind of accountability, I mean, government is so slow and grinding and it feels very frustrating to people. And the flip side of it being slow and grinding is that no one's going to cut off your social security overnight. That would also be a slow and grinding process, hopefully. So, one thing that the auditor sort of spoke about, and actually is something that I've talked to some other federal employees who are not featured in this piece about, is their understanding of the government is sort of like the thing that is so frustrating for people is that it is so slow, but part of the reason it's so slow is because there's so many measures in place to make sure that you can't misuse government money. It's a response to previous audits, to previous investigations, to previous issues. And so, part of the reason that it might take months to get a federal contract, part of the reason it might take months to get cleared for something, is because there's all these tiny steps in between to make sure that they can't misappropriate government money. If anything, some of the slow grinding frustration that people express about the government is the response to trying to make sure that there is less ability for waste, fraud, and abuse.\nKatie Drummond: It is essentially the system working as it should, and presumably the result, as you say, of years and years of these audits, of these inspections, of this diligence, and this accountability, that has led us to the system that we have. Which yes, is slow and grinding, but again, is designed to prevent fraud and to provide services for the American people. Your example about social security is a great one. I mean, it might be frustrating to wait for your social security benefits to kick in, but the worst case scenario is that someone working with DOGE cancels your social security payments in the back end. And all of a sudden, you spend six months or a year struggling to have them reinstated, right?\nVittoria Elliott: Yeah, and again, I don't think there's any person who would be like, \"Oh, the government's really efficient and does exactly what it's supposed to do when it's supposed to do it.\" No, you could definitely make an argument for efficiency on the user end, right? But I think even the term government efficiency, are we using efficiency in the way that you and I might understand it like, this is faster and cleaner and better for us as end user? Or are we using efficiency in like the private equity sense, which is like, this is better at funneling money to private industry and specifically to the people at the top of private industry? Because that's another form of using efficiency.\nKatie Drummond: Well, it sure is. It seems like one that Elon Musk might be familiar with himself. So Tori, Elon Musk has described what DOGE is doing as essentially an audit of government waste, financial abuse across federal agencies. The auditors you spoke to though, didn't exactly see this DOGE effort as an audit. So, if it's not an audit, what is it?\nVittoria Elliott: So, I think the hardest thing is that we don't necessarily know. We do know that they're trying to get into these systems and cut spending, cut contracts, so I think that's a big one. But the auditors I spoke to said auditing is sort of seeing what's in there, providing recommendations. But first and foremost, it seems like they're going in, they're making a lot of cuts, and that isn't necessarily what you do in an audit, especially for things that are services that the government may continue to need in the future, that's going to move that work probably to the private sector. And secondly, that there's so much data that the government has, and they both said they couldn't help but think that the real goal was to have access to that kind of data, whether that's for training an LLM to replace people or something else, or whether that's for their own competitive advantage.\nKatie Drummond: Right. We are going to take a short break. We'll be back with Tori Elliott in a minute. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Katie Drummond, WIRED's Global editorial director. I'm joined by WIRED's Tori Elliott. Now Tori, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about this incredible feature that WIRED published late last week, and that you shared a byline on, along with several other reporters and editors. Now, the story was a deep dive into the first six weeks of DOGE. The headline on the piece is, Inside Elon Musk's 'Digital Coup,' great headline. You have been so in the weeds on DOGE for a couple of months now. Thank you, and I'm sorry. But what does this bigger story tell us about DOGE that you think is particularly important?\nVittoria Elliott: So, one of the biggest things that I think the feature really delivers is it helps sort of put these all together in one big picture to help people understand both the timeline of when all these things happened, which basically started the minute that Trump came into office. But also, helps people see how these different things connect together, the way that the takeover at the Office of Personnel Management, which is the government's HR, and then the takeover of the General Services Administration, which does a lot of its procurement stuff, also deals with its IT systems and property. Sort of like how taking over those agencies via repurposing the US digital service became this hub for everything else that the Trump Administration is doing in the government. And I think when we sort of lay it out in that way, you can see greater patterns, which is the focus on cutting employees, the focus on taking over IT systems, and very specifically the focus really on getting into contracting and payment systems. And in the case of USAID, the worst case scenario of what can happen, which is once someone is in your systems, they can shut your agency down.\nKatie Drummond: Which is exactly what happened with that one. Now, this story to me is really, if you're going to read one story about DOGE, if you can't keep up with the fire hose, this is the story to read. It really sort of walks audiences and walks readers through in this very step-by-step narrative, exactly what the last six weeks have looked like from within the administration. Now, let's take listeners inside the machine a little bit, how stories like this come to be. Now, I will caveat by telling everybody that there's a lot we can't share about our reporting, there's a lot that Tori can't say, but we do share in the piece that you and your colleagues talked to more than 150 people for this story. 150 people. I got a lot of text messages from friends after the story came out being like, \"150 people, Katie? What do you have these poor reporters doing all day?\" But you guys have been working really, really hard on this reporting. So, tell us about the last few weeks of your life as you have been working to put this feature together. What does that look like, reporting this day in and day out?\nVittoria Elliott: Yeah, it feels like a fire hose in my signal inbox. The thing that I notice so much is that a lot of the federal workers that I spoke to, they really just want to be heard. These are people who don't have big public profiles. When you're a federal worker, you can't go be politically involved in the same way. You can't necessarily go protest or campaign for someone. You can't hold certain types of financial products, if you're doing some kind of work at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or Treasury or whatever that might regulate that. So, I think most people that we spoke to first and foremost just really wanted to feel heard and felt so confused at how they'd dedicated their lives to this work and suddenly they were the bad guy. And I think there's an urgency to that. Their lives were changing so quickly, and there was sort of this outpouring of both information and a lot of emotion. So in some ways, I think it has felt very much like having a million close friends going through a breakup at the same time, where you don't want to leave them on read for too long, because people are taking both professional and emotional risks to talk to us, to be open with us, to tell us what their experience is or what they're seeing. And I think the biggest thing in how I've thought about this is, really trying to be responsive because when people are doing that, it's nice to know that there's another person on the other end. So I think there's this sort of immediacy to being responsive to people, to making sure we're asking the right questions while also being empathetic, while also being careful. And that I think would be challenging if it was just a few people, but it's many, many tens of people per each of us. And I think the big thing also is that you never really know where any individual conversation is going to lead, because sometimes people don't know what they know, like they don't know if they have important or insightful information. And so treating every conversation like it is both really valuable because someone can make a really offhand comment of like, \"Oh, this system normally works this way, and that can be a puzzle piece that can slot into something that someone else on the team is working on.\" But also because situations are so fraught right now, treating every conversation like it might be the last time you speak to that person.\nKatie Drummond: Right, absolutely. I mean, it's a tremendous amount of responsibility to bear. And just thinking about how many people you are talking to at any given time, I mean, it's a lot on one person's shoulders. Now, nine people share a byline on this story, which is relatively unusual for us at WIRED. And what that means if you're listening, is that nine journalists contributed reporting and writing to this single feature that we published on WIRED.com last week. So Tori, how do you work as a team to pull that kind of thing together? How do these nine people come together to pull off all of this reporting, all of this writing? Tell us a little bit about that.\nVittoria Elliott: So, this is the moment where we shout out Leah Feiger, Tim Marchman, and Zoe Schiffer, for being the stitchers of things. I feel like me and other people, we just were like, here is the five-page long document of everything we know about the particular things that we're reporting on. And they really went in and, because they've been editing a lot of our pieces and they have this higher level view about where some of our stuff fits with each other, they went in and did that initial stitching across multiple lines of reporting and storytelling. And then there was another document that was slightly shorter but not much shorter, and there's a lot of cool details that made it into the feature. There's also a lot of really interesting details that we just kind of couldn't get in there.\nKatie Drummond: Pick one. Is there anything that didn't make it into that story that you wish had, that you can share?\nVittoria Elliott: Initially we had some interesting stuff in there from a freelancer in South Africa.\nKatie Drummond: Oh, wow.\nVittoria Elliott: Who had talked a little bit about the way that when apartheid was in place and the white South African government, the way that they brute force transformed the country. And how growing up in that for someone like Musk, might really inform what you believe a top-down structure of elites in government might be able to do. And I think that was a really interesting perspective, but ultimately, we didn't get to use it for the piece. And also because it's I think, hard sometimes to speculate what is in anybody's head, but I think that kind of context of, where might someone's reference point be for the kind of decisions that they're making or how they think the system should work, is really interesting.\nKatie Drummond: That is interesting. Now, this feature that we published documented essentially the first six weeks of Musk and DOGE in D.C. inside the federal government. Let's imagine for a minute, not something journalists are necessarily particularly good at.\nVittoria Elliott: I don't think it's that we're not good at it. I think it's that we're very careful about facts.\nKatie Drummond: We're very careful, and we're going to do this very carefully. Let's imagine another six weeks go by. It's early May, Tori, and we are working on the second big feature about DOGE. What story do you think WIRED might be telling about DOGE by then? Knowing of course, that this is informed speculation, this is by no means the facts that we like to traffic in.\nVittoria Elliott: Well, I think we're probably going to have much more emphasis on Social Security Administration, that is according to reporting from our colleagues, Makena Kelly and David Gilbert, that's where a lot of DOGE operatives are currently concentrated right now. So I think, and Musk has already floated a lot of language around needing to curtail entitlements.\nKatie Drummond: Yes.\nVittoria Elliott: So I think Social Security will probably be the major focal point of whatever next beat there is. I think we're also going to see, as we've already seen, the Trump Administration has talked about really collapsing certain agencies like the Department of Education and USAID, folding them into other agencies. So, I think that we may also be looking at that, the sort of, what does it mean when you have whole agencies established by Congress being consolidated together or into other agencies? And what is that going to mean for things like data privacy? What is that going to mean for their systems? And I think maybe another thing that we're going to see more of is the use of AI tools by the government. What's being rolled out, where? Who's using it? What data is it being trained on? I think all of those questions are going to become more salient as the time goes on. And a lot of DOGE people are what we call special government employees. They are only supposed to have a tenure of around 130 days, which is about six months, which means that those who are doing this first wave of DOGE strike force may be out by June, and there may be a whole new group of people coming in to take their place. So, I think we will also be thinking about who is going to come in, assuming that they abide by these rules and they don't get extensions or special exceptions or whatever. I think we're going to be looking more at who's going to be coming in, what companies they're coming from. And I think we'll have a greater sense at that point at the extent to which these private sector connections are now firmly rooted in government.\nKatie Drummond: Fascinating, that was an excellent prediction. Thank you. We're going to take a short break, when we come back, Tori tells you what you need to read on WIRED today. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Katie Drummond, WIRED's Global Editorial Director. I'm joined by WIRED's Tori Elliott. Tori, before I let you go, tell our listeners what they absolutely must read on WIRED.com today, other than the stories we talked about in this episode.\nVittoria Elliott: Well, I'm going to do another shameless plug for the politics team.\nKatie Drummond: Please do.\nVittoria Elliott: So, we published a story this week by Leah Feiger and Zoe Schiffer about Donald Trump holding another million dollar candlelight dinner at Mar-a-Lago, featuring Elon Musk and I believe what appears to be Shivon Zilis, who is an executive at Neuralink, the brain computer interface company that Musk founded. And Zilis is also the mother of a few of the many of Musk's children.\nKatie Drummond: A few.\nVittoria Elliott: So I think it's one of those things that, first off, this is extraordinarily early in a presidency to be raising money already. And secondly, particularly with Musk as a backer who is committing tens of millions of dollars to the Trump campaign or to Trump more generally. But I think what we really see is this appropriation of Trump's time in this way, and it's pretty concerning because it's one thing to pay a lot of money to go to a fundraiser for a political candidate, we're very used to that during campaign season. I think it's another thing to see that it might become routine because this is the second one that we know of in six weeks. The idea that it might become routine for the president to be hosting dinners where people who can pay a million dollars or more can get a private audience with him.\nKatie Drummond: Right, you're essentially paying to access President Trump and Elon Musk in this scenario. I think worth pointing out two things that stand out to me. One, Trump can't run for office again.\nVittoria Elliott: Yeah, not yet.\nKatie Drummond: Where this money is going is pretty murky. Two, I thought it was really interesting and notable that the first of these dinners WIRED reported on a few weeks ago was actually on the President's official schedule, this second dinner was not. So it certainly appears as though there is some desire here to fly below the radar in the context of these candlelight dinners. I also hate the fact that candles are involved for some reason, it makes me very uncomfortable. Tori Elliott, thank you so much for joining me today.\nVittoria Elliott: Thank you so much for having me.\nKatie Drummond: All right, that's our show.

    "content_text": "Tesla said Thursday it would recall nearly all the Cybertrucks it has produced to repair a stainless steel trim panel that the carmaker said could become detached from the vehicle while driving. It’s the eighth recall for the distinctive all-electric pickup, which hit US roads just over two years ago.\nUnlike many other Tesla-related recalls, though, this one cannot be fixed with an over-the-air software update; the trucks must be brought into a service center for repairs. The recall affects more than 46,000 Cybertrucks manufactured between November 2023 and late February 2025.\nThe recall is related to a cosmetic applique on the vehicle’s exterior, which is attached to the rest of the truck by a kind of glue, according to a filing published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the US’s road safety regulator. On affected Cybertrucks, the adhesive can separate from the rest of the truck, creating a possible “road hazard” for others and increasing the risk of a crash.\nComplaints about the trim first bubbled up in social media posts; Tesla reportedly halted Cybertruck production last week. Tesla says in the filing that it began to investigate the issue in early January. The filing says Tesla will repair the issue with another kind of adhesive “not prone to environmental embrittlement.”\nDale Harrow, chair and director of the Intelligent Mobility Design Center at the Royal College of Art London, labels this latest glue recall for the Cybertruck as “surprising.”\n“Glues are used a lot more than people think in car body construction these days,” he says. “Rather than having a mechanical fixing, weld or a screw or a bolt, it's very effective gluing panels together for a lighter construction. It's become very popular. Jaguar, Lexus, Audi, they'll use glues at some point. So I'm very surprised. It's not as if it's an unknown science. I've not heard [of problems] anywhere else.”\nThere are numerous glues the auto industry uses to bond panels and parts together, Harrow says, adding that different adhesives are used depending on strength of bond needed, particular circumstances, and materials involved. However, what is different with the Cybertruck compared to other vehicles is its highly unconventional use of stainless steel for its panels.\n“Stainless steel is the big difference,\" Harrow says. \"So maybe there's been an issue there?\" Harrow points out that this fault appears to be happening in cold weather, and that it might be that the stainless steel is conducting cold better, possibly just enough to make a difference in the curing process.\n“I could surmise that something on the production line is not quite bonding at the right temperature or getting the right UV coverage? And that could be due to the stainless steel having a different density from standard steel. It's not a small company, and it's not doing things on the cheap. So I'll be very surprised if there wasn't the knowledge within the company to fix this. But it would need quite a bit of investigation, I think, to find out the real cause of it.”\nVehicle recalls have become more common as cars have grown increasingly sophisticated and reliant on electronic components that can be adjusted—but also malfunction—via software. Annual US recalls grew by nearly 70 percent between 2003 and 2023, according to NHTSA, affecting 83 percent more vehicles. The number of recall-related vehicle repairs completed through over-the-air updates grew 10-fold between 2019 and 2023.\nBut five of the Cybertruck’s recalls have required Tesla drivers to bring their vehicles into the shop. The most sweeping have included recalls related to failed front windshield wiper motor controllers and malfunctioning pedal pads, which Tesla said were treated with an unapproved soap during assembly that allowed them to become trapped, leading to “unintended acceleration.”\nEven before the Cybertruck began to roll off production lines, the truck was subject to snafus and delays. Its glitzy 2019 unveiling event may be most memorable for an incident in which a prototype’s supposedly unbreakable glass failed to stand up to a metal ball thrown at its driver window. Amidst the pandemic, Tesla pushed Cybertruck production from 2021 to late 2022 and finally to late 2023. Meanwhile, its base price jumped from $40,000 to $61,000.\nLeaked internal documents later obtained by the German newspaper Handelsblatt and WIRED showed that, by January 2022, Tesla was still struggling internally with a preproduction “alpha” version of the vehicle, which had basic issues with suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking.\nThe Cybertruck’s rocky start does not seem to have bothered the White House. Last week, the electric truck sat among other Tesla models parked on a presidential driveway as President Donald Trump promoted adviser and DOGE head Elon Musk’s automaker. “Everything’s computer!” Trump exclaimed, as the White House Press Corps looked on. Perhaps sensing the oncoming glue snafu, or perhaps merely not liking the possibility of rust damage, President Trump declined to purchase a Cybertruck, stating that instead he would write a check for Tesla’s Model S Plaid, which notably is not made of stainless steel.",

    "content_text": "This story contains mentions of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, please call 1-800-273-8255 for free, 24-hour support from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\nTwenty-three-year-old Arnold Robert Haro addressed his final words to the phone in his hand. “If I die, I hope you guys turn this into a memecoin,” he said. Then Haro took his own life.\nHaro died on February 21 at his family home in Madera County, California, a death certificate obtained by WIRED shows. His suicide was broadcast live to his followers on X, where he went by the handle @MistaFuccYou. Footage of Haro’s death has since been removed from the platform, but the incident was briefly listed in its trending tab.\nIn the hours after Haro’s death, people created dozens of memecoins—a type of highly volatile crypto coin used as a vector for financial speculation—modeled after him. Sensing an opportunity to profit, traders piled into one of the coins in particular, driving its value to $2.1 million in aggregate. (The coin has since lost 96 percent of its value.)\nOn X, some tried to argue that whoever was behind the MistaFuccYou coin had duly granted Haro’s final wish. But most denounced the impulse among traders to try to profit by his death. “If you’re trading this, you’re sick af,” wrote one user.\nSpeculation ran rampant on X that Haro had ended his life because he had lost money to a memecoin rugpull—a maneuver whereby somebody creates a new coin, promotes it online, then sells off their holdings in one swoop, devaluing everyone else’s stake. WIRED was unable to confirm whether this had happened to Haro, but his friends have disputed the narrative. “It had nothing to do with crypto … It’s not what all these crypto nerds seem to think,” one of Haro’s friends, who goes by j nova on social media, told WIRED. Haro’s family, meanwhile, has described his death as the result of “his battle with depression.”\nThe incident captures in microcosm the race to the bottom in memecoin trading circles, where only the most heinous and morally bankrupt ideas are now rewarded with attention, says Azeem Khan, cofounder of the Morph blockchain and venture partner at crypto VC firm Foresight Ventures.\n“We’ve reached the point where the most potentially exciting launch that people are looking at is Kanye trying to launch a swastika coin,” says Khan, in reference to now-deleted X posts made by an account associated with the artist Kanye West. “That’s how terrible this space is.”\nUntil last year, launching a memecoin was relatively expensive and technically burdensome, which meant few came to market. Only Dogecoin—the original memecoin—and a handful of derivatives had any sort of longevity.\nThat equation was reversed with the arrival of Pump.Fun, a platform that makes it simple for anyone to launch a memecoin at no cost. Since Pump.Fun launched in January 2024, many millions of memecoins have flooded the market, among them the coins modeled after Haro.\nIn a statement provided to WIRED, Pump.Fun spokesperson Troy Gravitt described Haro’s death as a “tragedy,” but explained that the coins made in his image, though “clearly in poor taste,” do not violate the platform’s terms of use. “There was no content associated with the token that would have identified it as either illicit or explicit,” says Gravitt.\nBetting on memecoins is lionized in certain online crypto circles, where traders are euphemistically described as charging headlong into “the trenches.” But behind the combat metaphor is an implicit recognition that the odds are stacked against the individual “trencher,” particularly given the prevalence of rug pulls and alleged collusion between the insiders behind certain high-profile memecoin launches.\n“Everyone assumes that crypto is where you come to become rich, no matter how dumb you are. I think it’s the exact opposite,” says Khan. “There are these layers of insiders … retail traders are always exit liquidity.” In other words, regular people buying into coins allows insiders to cash out at a profit.\nThe new cultural prominence of highly volatile memecoins, which offer the prospect both of outsized gains and losses, is also likely to have compounded the risk for people predisposed to problem gambling or trading, researchers say.\n“People have enormous capacity to make money very quickly. The appeal of making money rings so much louder than calls of danger,” says Benjamin Johnson, a PhD candidate at the University of Queensland specializing in the public health implications of digital technologies. “Adding to the attraction with memecoins is that you’ve got these online communities where people really congregate. It becomes an emotional attachment to these assets … It creates a perfect storm.”\nThough academics have not identified a direct association between crypto trading and heightened psychological distress, the externalities of crypto trading—namely, the likelihood of losing money—are shown to have a negative impact on mental well-being. And the vast majority of memecoins released on Pump.Fun wind up practically worthless.\n“If you are really into day trading, it is definitely something that is likely to cause people mental stress or psychological distress,” says Atte Oksanen, a professor of psychology at Tampere University, who has conducted multiple studies on the mental health implications of crypto trading. “Financial problems cause a lot of stress, which can escalate.”\nMeanwhile, the glut of memecoins entering the market through Pump.Fun—among them coins issued by celebrities like rapper Iggy Azelea—has led coin creators to take increasingly elaborate, sexually degrading, and sometimes dangerous measures to attract attention to their coins. One guy ended up catching on fire after a memecoin promotional stunt went awry, leaving him with serious burns.\nThe launch of US president Donald Trump’s memecoin in January pushed the fight for attention to new extremes. The inevitable effect has been that only the most depraved and provocative concepts—like the MistaFuccYou coin, based on a suicide—so much as register in the hive mind of memecoin traders. And even then, only briefly.\n“The president of one of the most powerful countries in the world launches a coin. How much further is there to go?” says Khan. “Then if you hit the top of the market, how quickly will all of this vaporware actually end up nosediving?”\nThe calculus among memecoin traders is captured on Pump.Fun in the comment section for the MistaFuccYou coin. “This token shows how fucked the trenches are rn, and is highly unethical,” wrote one user, before implying that others should invest.\nIn the process, people like Haro—whose X feed is a kaleidoscope of memes, practical jokes, guns, women, weed, and crypto—are effectively erased; quite literally commodified into an incomplete and cartoonish version of themselves.\nA fundraising page set up by Haro’s family to help cover the funeral costs paints a more three-dimensional picture: “Arnold was a bright, kind, and hilarious soul who brought light to those around him,” reads a description written by a family member. “He had a gift for making people laugh, spreading joy, and offering unwavering support, even when he was struggling himself.”\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for free, 24-hour support from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

    "content_text": "Artificial intelligence has to date been enlisted as a bogeyman in cultural circles: Software will take the jobs of writers and translators, and AI-generated images ring the death toll for illustrators and graphic designers.\nYet there’s a corner of high culture where AI is taking on a starring role as hero, not displacing the traditional protagonists—art experts and conservators—but adding a powerful, compelling weapon to their arsenal when it comes to fighting forgeries and misattributions. AI is already exceptionally good at recognizing and authenticating an artist’s work, based on the analysis of a digital image of a painting alone.\nAI’s objective analysis has thrown a wrench into this traditional hierarchy. If an algorithm can determine the authorship of an artwork with statistical probability, where does that leave the old-guard art historians whose reputations have been built on their subjective expertise? In truth, AI will never replace connoisseurs, just as the use of x-rays and carbon dating decades ago did not. It is simply the latest in a line of high-tech tools to assist with authentication.\nA good AI must be “fed” a curated dataset by human art historians to build up its knowledge of an artist’s style, and human art historians must interpret the results. Such was the case in November 2024, when a leading AI firm, Art Recognition, published its analysis of Rembrandt’s The Polish Rider—a painting that famously confounded scholars and led to many arguments as to how much, if any of it, had actually been painted by Rembrandt himself. The AI precisely matched what most connoisseurs had posited about which parts of the painting were by the master, which were by students of his, and which involved the hand of over-enthusiastic restorers. It is particularly compelling when the scientific approach confirms the expert opinion.\nWe humans find hard scientific data more compelling than personal opinion, even when that opinion comes from someone who seems to be an expert. The so-called “CSI effect” describes how jurors perceive DNA evidence as more persuasive than even eyewitness testimony. But when expert opinion (the eyewitnesses), provenance, and scientific tests (the CSI) all agree on the same conclusion? That’s as close to a definitive answer as one can get.\nBut what happens when the owner of a work that, at first glance, looks totally inauthentic to the point of being laughable, recruits a slick firm with the task of gathering forensic evidence to support a preferable attribution?\nLost and Found\nBack in 2016, an oil painting surfaced at a flea market in Minnesota and was bought for less than $50. Now its owners are suggesting that it could be a lost Van Gogh, and therefore would be worth millions. (One estimate suggests $15 million.) The answer—at least to anyone with functioning eyeballs and a passing familiarity with art history—was a resounding “nah.” The painting is stiff, clumsy, utterly lacking the feverish impasto and rhythmic brushwork that define the Dutch artist’s oeuvre. Worse still, it bore a signature: Elimar. And yet, this dubious painting has become the center of a high-stakes battle for authenticity, one in which scientific analysis, market forces, and wishful thinking collide.\nThe owners of the “Elimar Van Gogh,” as it has come to be derisively known in art circles, are now an art consultancy group called LMI International. They are investing heavily in getting experts to say what they want to hear: that it is, in fact, a genuine Van Gogh. This is where things get murky. The world of art authentication is not a straightforward affair. Unlike the hard sciences, art history deals in probabilities, connoisseurship, and competing expert opinions. It is also, crucially, an industry driven by financial incentives. If the painting is deemed real, its value skyrockets. If it’s deemed a fake, or rather in this case a derivative work by someone named Elimar who daubed a bit on canvas, distantly inspired by Van Gogh perhaps, but with none of his talents, it's virtually worthless—about as valuable as you might expect to find at a flea market in Minnesota for under 50 bucks. This imbalance in stakes has led to a dangerous trend: hiring experts not to determine authenticity, but to affirm it.\nThere are precedents. The so-called “Lost Jackson Pollock” was a painting found at a California flea market in the early 1990s by Teri Horton, a retired truck driver with no art background. She purchased the large, chaotic canvas for $5, unaware that its swirling drips and splatters bore a resemblance to the work of Jackson Pollock. When someone pointed out the similarity, Horton embarked on a decades-long quest to authenticate it that was documented in the 2006 film Who the #$&% Is Jackson Pollock?\nHorton’s attempts at authentication clashed with the traditional, often opaque, art world. Major Pollock experts refused to endorse the painting, citing the lack of provenance, as there was no documented link to Pollock’s studio. In response, Horton turned to forensic science. She hired Peter Paul Biro, a controversial fingerprint expert, who claimed to have found a fingerprint on the painting that matched one on a paint can in Pollock’s studio. This was not enough to sway the art establishment. On the contrary, a 2010 New Yorker feature by David Grann called “Mark of a Masterpiece” thoroughly discredited Biro and his authentication work. Biro then sued for libel and lost. Despite extensive efforts, no museum or auction house accepted the work as genuine, leaving it unsold and its status forever in limbo—a stark example of how difficult (and subjective) authentication can be when money, reputations, and scientific claims collide. That’s what happens when such an approach goes wrong. Will the Elimar owners have better luck now that new technology is available to provide newer ways of authenticating art?\nReal Talk\nArt has traditionally been authenticated in one of three ways: connoisseurship, provenance research, and forensic testing. Connoisseurship is the oldest and remains the default method; it relies on the opinion of self-proclaimed experts who physically examine the object in question and tell you what they think. Provenance research follows the documented history of an object, and is useful for establishing whether such an object is documented as having ever existed—mentioned in archival materials, letters, catalogues raisonnés, or gallery listings—or whether a chain of ownership and attribution is accounted for that suggests that the work was not stolen and that it has been considered authentic for an extended period of time. Forensic testing involves conservators examining the object with methods like carbon dating, x-rays, and infrared spectroscopy to see if there are anachronistic elements or if all appears as it should be for an artwork of the era and authorship that the experts suppose it to have. The owners of the Elimar painting are hoping that one or more of these three approaches will suggest that their flea market painting is indeed a Van Gogh.\nEnter LMI Group International, a data science firm that bought the “Elimar” from the original owner and assembled a 458-page document that claims to authenticate the painting. The phrasing is important—because their role is not to assess whether it is by Van Gogh, but rather to find a way to confirm that it is. This distinction is everything. If the painting is declared genuine, the owners, the experts, and the auction houses involved all stand to profit handsomely. If it is declared inauthentic, the only winners are the people who weren’t taken in by the charade in the first place. Given these dynamics, skepticism should be the default response.\nAs of writing, not one renowned Van Gogh expert has publicly endorsed the painting. The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, widely regarded as the foremost authority on the artist's oeuvre, has twice evaluated the painting and concluded that it is not an authentic Van Gogh. It did this first in 2019 when, based on stylistic features, it determined the work could not be attributed to Van Gogh. Even after reviewing new information presented by LMI Group in an extensive report, the museum doubled down, reaffirming its stance in January 2025, stating: “We maintain our view that this is not an authentic painting by Vincent van Gogh.”\nOther experts agreed. Famed American art critic Jerry Saltz posted on social media, “Next up: A newly discovered Michelangelo, signed ‘Steve.’”\nSo if it’s not a Van Gogh, what is it? Some art historians have proposed that “Elimar” may be the work of Henning Elimar, a lesser-known Danish artist. This theory is supported by similarities in signature and style between the painting in question and known works by Henning Elimar.\nHang on. An Elimar painting signed “Elimar” could actually be by Elimar? That certainly sounds more plausible.\nSo connoisseurs are not helping out the owners of the former flea-market painting. What does the provenance have to say about it? Typically, a documented chain of ownership is crucial in establishing a work's authenticity. In the case of “Elimar,” no such documentation exists before its 2016 appearance, making it challenging to attribute the painting to Van Gogh.\nAdditionally, comprehensive catalogues raisonnés, such as those compiled by Jacob Baart de la Faille and Jan Hulsker, do not list anything resembling “Elimar” among Van Gogh's known works. These catalogues aim to document all recognized artworks by the artist, and the absence of something that could fit the description of “Elimar” further discredits claims of its authenticity.\nHow about forensics?\nAuthentication Factor\nSince the era of the “Lost Jackson Pollock” a new authentication method has arrived, one that harnesses AI and machine learning.\nThe aforementioned Art Recognition has already run its own AI analysis on the painting—and the results are damning. Company founder Carina Popovici tells me that according to Art Recognition’s closed AI algorithm, there is a 97 percent certainty that the painting is not by Van Gogh. This is a significant result and one that, until now, has not been made public.\nArt Recognition, based in Zurich, has trained its algorithm on 834 verified authentic Van Gogh artworks and 1,785 inauthentic images (to teach it what not to be fooled by). The program can analyze brushstroke patterns, color composition, and other features imperceptible to the human eye. (Full disclosure: I have advised Art Recognition in my capacity as an author and researcher on forgery and art theft, but my opinion on the “Elimar” was formed long before my involvement with the company.)\nThe fact that Art Recognition’s AI has come back with such a strong negative result should, in theory, settle the matter. And yet, the painting is still being championed by LMI Group International, whose mission appears to be less about discovery and more about justification. LMI’s website still bears the headline: “Elimar Returns: A Newly Identified Work by Vincent van Gogh. Read the entire report establishing the authorship of this painting by Vincent van Gogh.” Despite this, no one of importance seems to be convinced. LMI supposedly paid around $1 million to have the painting authenticated. That is an astounding sum—authenticating a painting should cost far less than that. (Art Recognition charges only four figures to test via its AI system.)\nThis is not an isolated case. The art market has long had a problem with potential conflicts of interest in authentication. The stakes are too high, and there is often more financial incentive in declaring a work real than in dismissing it as a fake or misattributed work of little value.\nThe art world prides itself on connoisseurship—the ability of trained experts to recognize an artist’s hand through years of study. The saga of the “Elimar Van Gogh” serves as a case study in how art authentication can go astray when it is led by hypothesis bias. In brief: We want this to be by Van Gogh, make a case to confirm it. Authentication is a process that, at its best, should be about discovery and scholarly rigor. But too often it is driven by the pursuit of profit, leading to situations where scientific findings are ignored in favor of more convenient conclusions, or where data is manufactured or interpreted in a way to prove a hypothesis rather than allow for the most logical, objective conclusion.\nIn cases like this one, AI can provide a crucial check on the excesses of the market. It is objective, dispassionate, and—unlike human experts—not subject to financial motivation. And in this instance, it has done what should have been obvious from the start: It has called out the painting as not by the famous artist in question.\nWith AI authentication gaining traction, and with the art world increasingly aware of the conflicts of interest inherent in traditional methods, there is hope for a more transparent future. Importantly, AI is a forensic tool that can test a work in question using a digital image alone, thereby obviating the need to send a fragile painting on an expensive and risky trip to a lab. This makes it a powerful assistant to, but not a replacement for, human experts, researchers, and conservators around the world.\nFor now, one thing is certain: If a painting doesn’t look like a Van Gogh, isn’t signed by Van Gogh, and is confirmed by AI not to be a Van Gogh, then—despite what the market might wish—it simply isn’t a Van Gogh.",

AI is already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c58fa73-9d47-46a6-8b03-a1aae54a7236\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">exceptionally good</a> at recognizing and authenticating an artist’s work, based on the analysis of a digital image of a painting alone.</p><p class=\"paywall\">AI’s objective analysis has thrown a wrench into this traditional hierarchy. If an algorithm can determine the authorship of an artwork with statistical probability, where does that leave the old-guard art historians whose reputations have been built on their subjective expertise? In truth, AI will never replace connoisseurs, just as the use of x-rays and carbon dating decades ago did not. It is simply the latest in a line of high-tech tools to assist with authentication.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">A good AI must be “fed” a curated dataset by human art historians to build up its knowledge of an artist’s style, and human art historians must interpret the results. Such was the case in November 2024, when a leading AI firm, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://art-recognition.com/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://art-recognition.com/\" href=\"https://art-recognition.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Art Recognition</a>, published its analysis of Rembrandt’s <em>The Polish Rider</em>—a painting that famously confounded scholars and led to many arguments as to how much, if any of it, had actually been painted by Rembrandt himself. The AI precisely matched what most connoisseurs had posited about which parts of the painting were by the master, which were by students of his, and which involved the hand of over-enthusiastic restorers. It is particularly compelling when the scientific approach confirms the expert opinion.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">We humans find hard scientific data <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14adf0ac-7b09-48ed-bb35-b8db5af9e516\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more compelling than personal opinion</a>, even when that opinion comes from someone who seems to be an expert. The so-called “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/csi_effect\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CSI effect</a>” describes how jurors perceive DNA evidence as more persuasive than even eyewitness testimony. But when expert opinion (the eyewitnesses), provenance, and scientific tests (the CSI) all agree on the same conclusion? That’s as close to a definitive answer as one can get.</p><p class=\"paywall\">But what happens when the owner of a work that, at first glance, looks totally inauthentic to the point of being laughable, recruits a slick firm with the task of gathering forensic evidence to support a preferable attribution?</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Lost and Found</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Back in 2016, an oil painting surfaced at a flea market in Minnesota and was bought for less than $50. Now its owners are suggesting that <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/fine-art/vincent-van-gogh-painting-elimar-garage-sale-d07e4817\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/fine-art/vincent-van-gogh-painting-elimar-garage-sale-d07e4817\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/fine-art/vincent-van-gogh-painting-elimar-garage-sale-d07e4817\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">it could be a lost Van Gogh</a>, and therefore would be worth millions. (One estimate suggests $15 million.) The answer—at least to anyone with functioning eyeballs and a passing familiarity with art history—was a resounding “nah.” The painting is stiff, clumsy, utterly lacking the feverish impasto and rhythmic brushwork that define the Dutch artist’s oeuvre. Worse still, it bore a signature: Elimar. And yet, this dubious painting has become the center of a high-stakes battle for authenticity, one in which scientific analysis, market forces, and wishful thinking collide.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The owners of the “Elimar Van Gogh,” as it has come to be derisively known in art circles, are now an <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/arts/design/van-gogh-museum-authentication.html\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/arts/design/van-gogh-museum-authentication.html\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/16/arts/design/van-gogh-museum-authentication.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">art consultancy group called LMI International</a>.

This is where things get murky. The world of art authentication is not a straightforward affair. Unlike the hard sciences, art history deals in probabilities, connoisseurship, and competing expert opinions. It is also, crucially, an industry driven by financial incentives. If the painting is deemed real, its value skyrockets. If it’s deemed a fake, or rather in this case a derivative work by someone named Elimar who daubed a bit on canvas, distantly inspired by Van Gogh perhaps, but with none of his talents, it's virtually worthless—about as valuable as you might expect to find at a flea market in Minnesota for under 50 bucks. This imbalance in stakes has led to a dangerous trend: hiring experts not to determine authenticity, but to affirm it.</p></div></div></body></html>",

Subscribe Today.\nHow I Tested\nI've been writing about air quality for WIRED since 2019. All the humidifiers in this review were tested in my 100-plus-year-old apartment with the heat on. I was looking for user-friendly humidifiers that could fill a medium-size room with the ideal moisture. I didn’t want to lug jugs of distilled water up my stairs; I also wanted one that was easy to maintain. I was looking for a more committed and sustainable relationship with my humidifier. Maybe you want that too.\nRecommended With Reservations\nCarepod Mini for $150: When turned on, the Carepod Mini looks like a Brita Filter that's also an electric tea kettle. And you’ll think this too because of the Carepod’s unique oscillator that moves the water around inside the clear plastic tank. And unlike the larger stainless steel parts of the larger Carepod models, the Carepod Mini is not dishwasher safe. However, like all Carepod models, the Mini doesn’t have a filter because Carepod recommends using filtered water, putting the water-purifying duties on the user. I would prefer a model with a filter option. Still, the Mini is easy to clean with mild soap and water, unlike some humidifiers that require special descaling solutions. I like what Carepod is trying to do in the humidifier market space, but I almost tipped the whole thing over when I instinctively picked it up by the handle that only lifts up the top part. Still, I found the percolating water effect to be soothing and it does a good job of providing a steady flow of mist. I elevated my Carepod Mini because of its slightly sideways mist flow. I put it on a ceramic plant stand because Carepod warns against placing the Mini directly on wood or furniture because of possible water damage. And while I still do not understand the benefits of Carepod’s oscillator, it looks cool.\nNot Recommended\nPure Enrichment Hume XL Humidifier for $80: There are certain design issues that can make a humidifier less user-friendly, and Pure Enrichment’s Hume XL has them all. To begin with, the Hume XL has the old-style tank that needs to be removed and flipped over to fill from the bottom, with a cap that needs to be unscrewed. And while The Hume has a surprisingly large-capacity 5-gallon tank, the filling process is cumbersome and I always spilled water while doing it. And while the Hume XL has an automatic shut off when the tank is empty, the opaque black plastic tank is nearly impossible to see through, making it difficult to gauge if I need to fill the tank. There’s also no indicator light to let me know the tank is running low. And while the Hume XL has a solid five-year warranty, night light, and two settings for low or high mist, it’s neither app compatible nor does it have a built-in humidistat. Other lower-cost models have these features. Lastly, the decalcification cartridge filter is sold separately.",

Learn more.\nSatellite internet is blasting off right now.\nNations and states are inking deals with satellite providers to fill in service gaps for their residents and keep their critical infrastructure connected. Phone makers are building satellite capabilities into their handsets. Airlines are partnering with satellite operators to keep your in-flight Netflix stream stutter-free. And the race to blast the satellites powering these networks into orbit is helping the rocket business thrive.\nAll of this adds up to boom times for satellite internet. But there’s another factor that could cause the tech’s proliferation to accelerate further: artificial intelligence.\nThe AI industry is keen to see a fully connected world because of the benefits a persistent connection can bring to its products, says Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. The near future of the AI arms race hinges on agents, smart-ish virtual assistants that can automate various parts of your life. But those AI agents have to be on call 24/7 to be effective, which requires an always-on internet connection. And the fast pace of AI agent innovation requires the AI models to be tweaked and updated often, which makes a direct connection indispensable.\n“We're still very much dependent on the cloud because things are changing so fast,” Sag says. “You can't just deploy an AI model to an endpoint and expect that you're not going to have to update that model pretty regularly.”\nAnother beneficiary of the satellite internet expansion is likely to be the great, flawed landscape that is the internet of things. IoT tech like free-roaming robot vacuums, road-tripping luggage trackers, and security cameras at the edge of your property will no longer struggle to stay connected while they transfer videos, photos, commands, and location data.\n“I think IoT will become more relevant,” Sag says, “because satellite connectivity will enable more IoT devices to feed back into AI.”\nIf you have satellites blanketing the entire planet giving real-time data of where devices are and how they’re moving, that offers up a massive feast of information for AI to gobble up and, hopefully, to digest into something usable.\n“IoT struggled significantly because nobody knew what to do with the data,” Sag says of the past decade. “But AI loves data. And the more data you give it, the more you can empower it to make better decisions.”\nA Link to the Stars\nOf all the major players in satellite internet, Starlink looms the largest. It provides solid internet service to over 4.5 million subscribers around the world, many of whom would otherwise not have access to a reliable connection. It’s also a subsidiary of SpaceX and controlled by CEO Elon Musk, the person leading the systematic dismemberment of federal agencies across the entire pantheon of government in the US. Thanks to Musk, Starlink’s internet service is even installed at the White House. That political connection is unsavory to some, and it’s sending some potential customers elsewhere. Starlink is controversial for other reasons too: The service was found to be used by a criminal organization in Myanmar to keep a slavery-powerd scam operation online.\nBut Starlink is beloved by millions of rural residents and rich yacht owners alike. The US military is excited about using it to keep troops connected in the field. Corporations are hitching their wagon to Starlink as well, with travel providers like United Airlines and cruise ship companies hoping to keep customers online as they scurry around the globe.\nT-Mobile recently partnered with Starlink to provide connectivity to customers in reception dead zones. Starlink on T-Mobile, Sag says, is an example of this satellite technology being implemented in a simple and effective way. If you go out of the range of a terrestrial T-Mobile reception tower, your phone can connect to Starlink passively, without having to fiddle with changing networks yourself.\n“They worked extremely closely with Google and Apple to make sure that this was a super, super easy experience,” Sag says. “You don't need an app and you don't have to click any buttons. It just works.”\nTerrestrial wireless connections already have that sort of interoperability built in. If you’re traveling and lose connection with a cell tower, there’s probably another one close by that your device will automatically connect to. Satellite internet provides that same unbroken experience even when there are no cell towers to connect to—for phones, trackers, and a litany of connected gadgets.\nGot You Covered\nOf course, Starlink’s satellites are not the only ones on the launchpad. The same day T-Mobile first announced its partnership with Starlink, the European Commission also announced it had signed a contract to put a constellation of 290 satellites into orbit as part of its own Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite (IRIS²) program.\nAmazon’s Project Kuiper already has prototypes in the sky, and is aiming to get more than 3,000 satellites into orbit to provide broadband internet service. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has spun off its own satellite provider named Taara to better compete in the field. Three Chinese firms have joined the fray, which also includes players like Lynk Global and Eutelsat OneWeb.\nAT&T and Verizon are both working with the Texas satellite company AST Space Mobile to expand their coverage areas. (Verizon has also been working with Project Kuiper since 2021.) Apple has invested $1.5 billion into the satellite company Globalstar with the goal of building out its own constellation that can enable Apple devices to use features like Emergency SOS and car crash detection in remote areas without a cell signal.\n“The advantage of these global constellations and why we're building them is that they have global coverage,” says Ian Christensen, senior director of private sector programs at the Secure World Foundation, an organization that advocates for cooperative and sustainable space tech. “You don't worry about being in a place where you connect with a Starlink satellite, but not a Globalstar satellite.”\nThe way that ease of interoperability could go awry, Christensen cautions, is if devices themselves are locked to proprietary satellite systems. So if Globalstar satellites only worked on Apple phones or vice versa, there could be some gaps in the constellation of coverage. That doesn’t seem like the plan for the companies involved, however. A more likely evolution of this globe-spanning network, Christensen says, is that satellites become platform-agnostic, much the way land-based telecom operations are.\n“Most of your devices actually can talk to the Russian system, the Chinese system, and the US system,” Christensen says. “Devices are interoperable in that way, and that's a design choice.”\nPartly Cloudy Skies\nLots of experts, Christensen included, have concerns with the sustainability of satellite operations. In August 2024, the advocacy group PIRG called on the FCC to limit how many satellites are launched into orbit until a comprehensive environmental review can detail the widespread effects of blasting thousands of satellites into the sky.\nThere’s also the matter that satellite internet is typically slower than the speeds we’re used to with fiber-based broadband. While the data rate might be sufficient for our connectivity needs now, it might get bogged down as the number of connected devices grows—especially if those devices are as data-hungry as an always-connected AI agent.\nRegardless, the race for low-Earth orbit is well underway. And your phone will be plugged into the space internet sooner than you think.\n“Fundamentally, I think it will become standardized that all phones have satellite connectivity, because the value of saving a life is literally priceless,” Sag says. “I wouldn't want to go out into a place where I don't have service without it.”",

    "content_text": "Commercial quadcopters have been on the mainstream gadget scene for 15 years, proliferating across industries and among hobbyists. There's a swanky DJI store on New York City's Fifth Avenue, and you probably have a neighbor, not to mention a roofer, who owns a drone. So when researchers at the embedded-device security firm Red Balloon started seeing surprising quadcopter accessories on Chinese shopping platforms like Temu and AliExpress, they didn't think much of it at first. As with any popular gadget type, there's a whole ecosystem of niche, wacky, and comical add-ons available for drones. But the more Red Balloon CEO Ang Cui thought about it, the more unsettled he and his colleagues became about how cheap and easy it would be for anyone to buy seemingly disparate add-ons that could easily turn a mainstream quadcopter into a war machine.\nThe accessories the researchers found include AI drone guidance modules—essentially small mounted cameras that use object recognition to identify humans and road vehicles at long range—and miles-long fiber optic tethers. Like plugging an ethernet cable directly into your laptop, miles-long tethers allow drones to fly around a large area without being vulnerable to disruption by signal jammers. The researchers recognized them from battlefield footage and other reports that such tethers—not to mention AI guidance modules—are being used by both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war to drop explosives or autopilot crash entire drones themselves into tracked objects without requiring operator control.\nThe fact that battlefield technology is widely available in the United States and around the world at low cost augurs a climate in which any actor—from criminal syndicates to paramilitary groups, from disgruntled employees to ostracized teens—can quickly and cheaply gather the needed equipment to remotely go on a destructive and violent rampage.\n“The more we looked at this and started to see the big picture, the more my heart sank, because these are toys that are really amazing at killing people,” Cui tells WIRED. “This tech didn't exist in the commercial space two years ago, it wasn't in demand from hobbyists, but now manufacturers are making it for war and it's spilling over.”\nThe Red Balloon researchers found that long-range quadcopters are readily available on marketplaces like AliExpress for under $300, with many priced at around $200 each. And the unit price of a long-range drone can drop even lower when purchased in bulk. The researchers noticed sellers who were claiming that they ship 60,000 of the long-range drones per month. They purchased a 1-mile-long tether from a seller on AliExpress for about $260 and another that is 7.5 miles long for about $700. Meanwhile, the researchers also purchased an AI guidance module from a different AliExpress seller for $325. Cui and his colleagues also purchased cargo holders that strap to drones and can be used to transport beer cans or water bottles, but could also be loaded with mortar bombs. These were $106 each. In the two months since the researchers made the purchases, they say the prices of most of the products they bought have even dropped slightly.\n“This equipment is mainstream, but it does not just cost a few dollars to make, so I think this stuff is being sold either at or below cost,” Cui says.\nIn December the Kyiv Post reported of the Ukrainian military's own long-range, tethered drones, that, “currently about 40 percent of the components [are] sourced locally in Ukraine while, because there is limited domestic microelectronics manufacturing capability, the rest are imported, primarily from China.”\nAliExpress parent company Alibaba and Temu did not respond to requests for comment from WIRED about whether such accessories—which are not inherently weapons themselves—pose any risks or have purchasing restrictions imposed on them in any markets.\n“I don't know a hobbyist that wants to fly a drone miles away with a tether to drop a water bottle in someone's yard,” says Dave Torres, Red Balloon's head of FPGA security. “I'm a combat veteran, so I'm used to dealing with IEDs and worrying about things that are buried in the ground. Well, now you have the capability to fly your IED over whoever you want to attack.”\nRed Balloon specializes in embedded device hardware and firmware analysis, so the researchers were interested to evaluate the processors and low-level code powering the fiber optic tethers and AI guidance components. In the tethers, they were surprised to find years-old, but relatively pricey, reprogrammable chips known as “field programmable gate arrays” or FPGAs (Torres' area of expertise). Inclusion of these chips was notable, because it suggests that the devices are designed to be more dynamic and expandable than what a hobbyist would presumably need. Meanwhile, the guidance modules have largely reliable object recognition using all the cheapest components possible, including Chinese-made chips as their main processor.\n“When I first saw the AI guidance components, one was advertising that it could identify a bird at 30 meters away and a horse at a hundred meters away—but later they actually just changed that to identifying people and cars,” says Cui. \"It's not specific people or specific models of vehicles, but they're not even dancing around it anymore that those are the categories of targets this would be used for.”\nCounter-drone defense tech is still, relatively, in its infancy around the world. Even vague sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena can throw airports, or the state of New Jersey, into chaos. As WIRED reported in December, the US Department of Homeland Security has been encouraging state and local law enforcement since at least last summer to assess their ability to respond to weaponized drones. In a memo, DHS warned that violent extremists in the US have been looking to modify “off-the-shelf” quadcopters to carry weapons, including \"explosives, conductive materials, and chemicals.\"\nRed Balloon is based in New York City, and the researchers note that as they were investigating drone accessories they began to realize that the few options currently available for stymying malicious drones can't be used in dense urban areas.\n“The things that work at taking them down are machine guns, lasers, and massive jammers—none of which can be used in a city,” Cui says. “This is why Red Balloon has been focusing on developing techniques appropriate for high-density environments to track and safely defeat these drones without shooting at them or without jamming.”\nSuch approaches could involve targeting drones at the protocol and firmware level to commandeer them and cause them to land. The researchers point out that the drones' ultra-low-cost development and manufacturing leaves no margin for research and development, testing, or onboard security protections. This represents a vulnerability for operators but could also be a benefit for defenders seeking to diffuse violent attacks without collateral damage.\nFor now, though, the proliferation of accessories to weaponize mainstream drones is a looming threat with no easy resolution.\n“Somebody who designs a plan and puts it into action could do some sophisticated damage for really, really cheap,” Red Ballon's Torres says. \"I wonder if the US military can even get defense contractors to build these devices for them for the price they're selling online.”",

    "content_text": "Elon Musk has pledged that the work of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, would be “maximally transparent.” DOGE’s website is proof of that, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, and now White House adviser, has repeatedly said. There, the group maintains a list of slashed grants and budgets, a running tally of its work.\nBut in recent weeks, The New York Times reported that DOGE has not only posted major mistakes to the website—crediting DOGE, for example, with saving $8 billion when the contract canceled was for $8 million and had already paid out $2.5 million—but also worked to obfuscate those mistakes after the fact, deleting identifying details about DOGE’s cuts from the website, and later even from its code, that made them easy for the public to verify and track.\nFor road-safety researchers who have been following Musk for years, the modus operandi feels familiar. DOGE “put out some numbers, they didn’t smell good, they switched things around,” alleges Noah Goodall, an independent transportation researcher. “That screamed Tesla. You get the feeling they’re not really interested in the truth.”\nFor nearly a decade, Goodall and others have been tracking Tesla’s public releases on its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features, advanced driver-assistance systems designed to make driving less stressful and more safe. Over the years, researchers claim, Tesla has released safety statistics without proper context; promoted numbers that are impossible for outside experts to verify; touted favorable safety statistics that were later proved misleading; and even changed already-released safety statistics retroactively. The numbers have been so inconsistent that Tesla Full Self-Driving fans have taken to crowdsourcing performance data themselves.\nInstead of public data releases, “what we have is these little snippets that, when researchers look into them in context, seem really suspicious,” alleges Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor and engineer who studies autonomous vehicles at the University of South Carolina.\nGovernment-Aided Whoopsie\nTesla’s first and most public number mix-up came in 2018, when it released its first Autopilot safety figures after the first known death of a driver using Autopilot. Immediately, researchers noted that while the numbers seemed to show that drivers using Autopilot were much less likely to crash than other Americans on the road, the figures lacked critical context.\nAt the time, Autopilot combined adaptive cruise control, which maintains a set distance between the Tesla and the vehicle in front of it, and steering assistance, which keeps the car centered between lane markings. But the comparison didn’t control for type of car (luxury vehicles, the only kind Tesla made at the time, are less likely to crash than others), the person driving the car (Tesla owners were more likely to be affluent and older, and thus less likely to crash), or the types of roads where Teslas were driving (Autopilot operated only on divided highways, but crashes are more likely to occur on rural roads, and especially connector and local ones).\nThe confusion didn’t stop there. In response to the fatal Autopilot crash, Tesla did hand over some safety numbers to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the nation’s road safety regulator. Using those figures, the NHTSA published a report indicating that Autopilot led to a 40 percent reduction in crashes. Tesla promoted the favorable statistic, even citing it when, in 2018, another person died while using Autopilot.\nBut by spring of 2018, the NHTSA had copped to the number being off. The agency did not wholly evaluate the effectiveness of the technology in comparison to Teslas not using the feature—using, for example, air bag deployment as an inexact proxy for crash rates. (The airbags did not deploy in the 2018 Autopilot death.)\nBecause Tesla does not release Autopilot or Full Self-Driving safety data to independent, third-party researchers, it’s difficult to tell exactly how safe the features are. (Independent crash tests by the NHTSA and other auto regulators have found that Tesla cars are very safe, but these don’t evaluate driver assistance tech.) Researchers contrast this approach with the self-driving vehicle developer Waymo, which often publishes peer-reviewed papers on its technology’s performance.\nStill, the unknown safety numbers did not prevent Musk from criticizing anyone who questioned Autopilot’s safety record. “It's really incredibly irresponsible of any journalists with integrity to write an article that would lead people to believe that autonomy is less safe,” he said in 2018, around the time the NHTSA figure publicly fell apart. “Because people might actually turn it off, and then die.”\nNumber Questions\nMore recently, Tesla has continued to shift its Autopilot safety figures, leading to further questions about its methods. Without explanation, the automaker stopped putting out quarterly Autopilot safety reports in the fall of 2022. Then, in January 2023, it revised all of its safety numbers.\nTesla said it had belatedly discovered that it had erroneously included in its crash numbers events where no airbags nor active restraints were deployed and that it had found that some events were counted more than once. Now, instead of dividing its crash rates into three categories, \"Autopilot engaged,” “without Autopilot but with our active safety features,” and “without Autopilot and without our active safety features,” it would report just two: with and without Autopilot. It applied those new categories, retroactively, to its old safety numbers and said it would use them going forward.\nThat discrepancy allowed Goodall, the researcher, to peer more closely into the specifics of Tesla’s crash reporting. He noticed something in the data. He expected the “without Autopilot” number to just be an average of the two old “without Auptilot” categories. It wasn’t. Instead, the new figure looked much more like the old “without Autopilot and without our active safety features” number. That’s weird, he thought. It’s not easy—or, according to studies that also include other car makes, common—for drivers to turn off all their active safety features, which include lane departure and forward collision warnings and automatic emergency braking.\nGoodall calculated that even if Tesla drivers were going through the burdensome and complicated steps of turning off their EV’s safety features, they’d need to drive way more miles than other Tesla drivers to create a sensible baseline. The upshot: Goodall wonders if Tesla is allegedly making its non-Autopilot crash rate look higher than it is—and so the Autopilot crash rate allegedly looks much better by comparison.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former Tesla or DOT employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at aarianm.30.\nThe discrepancy is still puzzling to the researcher, who published a peer-reviewed note on the topic last summer. Tesla “put out this data that looks questionable on first glance—and then you look at it, and it is questionable,” he claims. “Instead of taking it down and acknowledging it, they change the numbers to something that is even weirder and flawed in a more complicated way. I feel like I’m doing their homework at this point.” The researcher calls for more transparency. So far, Tesla has not put out more specific safety figures.\nTesla, which disbanded its public relations team in 2021, did not reply to WIRED’s questions about the study or its other public safety data.\nDirect Reports\nTesla is not a total outlier in the auto industry when it comes to clamming up about the performance of its advanced technology. Automakers are not required to make public many of their safety numbers. But where tech developers are required to submit public accounting on their crashes, Tesla is still less transparent than most. One prominent national data submission requirement, first instituted by the NHTSA in 2021, requires makers of both advanced driver assistance and automated driving tech to submit public data about its crashes. Tesla redacts nearly every detail about its Autopilot-related crashes in its public submissions.\n“The specifics of all 2,819 crash reports have been redacted from publicly available data at Tesla's request,” says Philip Koopman, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University whose research includes self-driving-car safety. “No other company is so blatantly opaque about their crash data.”\nThe federal government likely has access to details on these crashes, but the public doesn’t. But even that is at risk. Late last year, Reuters reported that the crash-reporting requirement appeared to be a focus of the Trump transition team.\nIn many ways, Tesla—and perhaps DOGE—is distinctive. “Tesla also uniquely engages with the public and is such a cause célèbre that they don’t have to do their own marketing. I think that also entails some special responsibility. Lots of claims are made on behalf of Tesla,” says Walker Smith, the law professor. “I think it engages selectively and opportunistically and does not correct sufficiently.”\nProponents of DOGE, like those of Tesla, engage enthusiastically on Musk’s platform, X, applauded by Musk himself.

DOGE “put out some numbers, they didn’t smell good, they switched things around,” alleges <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a-sp4KoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Noah Goodall</a>, an independent transportation researcher. “That screamed Tesla. You get the feeling they’re not really interested in the truth.”</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">For nearly a decade, Goodall and others have been tracking Tesla’s public releases on its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features, advanced driver-assistance systems designed to make driving less stressful and more safe. Over the years, researchers claim, Tesla has released safety statistics without proper context; promoted numbers that are impossible for outside experts to verify; touted favorable safety statistics that were later proved misleading; and even changed already-released safety statistics retroactively. The numbers have been so inconsistent that Tesla Full Self-Driving fans have taken to crowdsourcing <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://teslafsdtracker.com/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://teslafsdtracker.com/\" href=\"https://teslafsdtracker.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">performance data themselves</a>.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">Instead of public data releases, “what we have is these little snippets that, when researchers look into them in context, seem really suspicious,” alleges Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor and engineer who studies autonomous vehicles at the University of South Carolina.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Government-Aided Whoopsie</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Tesla’s first and most public number mix-up <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyRepor\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyRepor\" href=\"https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyRepor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">came in 2018</a>, when it released its first Autopilot safety figures after the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-ntsb-autopilot-crash-death/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first known death of a driver using Autopilot</a>. Immediately, researchers noted that while the numbers seemed to show that drivers using Autopilot were much less likely to crash than other Americans on the road, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-autopilot-safety-report-statistics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the figures lacked critical context</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">At the time, Autopilot combined adaptive cruise control, which maintains a set distance between the Tesla and the vehicle in front of it, and steering assistance, which keeps the car centered between lane markings. But the comparison didn’t control for type of car (luxury vehicles, the only kind Tesla made at the time, are less likely to crash than others), the person driving the car (Tesla owners were more likely to be affluent and older, and thus less likely to crash), or the types of roads where Teslas were driving (Autopilot operated only on divided highways, but crashes are more likely to occur on rural roads, and especially connector and local ones).</p><p class=\"paywall\">The confusion didn’t stop there. In response to the fatal Autopilot crash, Tesla <em>did</em> hand over some safety numbers to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the nation’s road safety regulator. Using those figures, the NHTSA <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2016/INCLA-PE16007-7876.PDF\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2016/INCLA-PE16007-7876.PDF\" href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2016/INCLA-PE16007-7876.PDF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published a report</a> indicating that Autopilot led to a 40 percent reduction in crashes.

    "content_text": "Isa Fulford, a researcher at OpenAI, had a hunch that Deep Research would be a hit even before it was released.\nFulford had helped build the artificial intelligence agent, which autonomously explores the web, deciding for itself what links to click, what to read, and what to collate into an in-depth report. OpenAI first made Deep Research available internally; whenever it went down, Fulford says, she was inundated with queries from colleagues eager to have it back. “The number of people who were DMing me made us pretty excited,” says Fulford.\nSince going live to the public on February 2, Deep Research has proven to be a hit with many users outside the company too.\n“Deep Research has written 6 reports so far today,” Patrick Collison, the CEO of Stripe posted on X a few days after the product was released. “It is indeed excellent. Congrats to the folks behind it.”\n“Deep Research is the AI product that really got a meaningful chunk of the policymaking community in DC to start feeling the AGI,” wrote Dean Ball, a fellow at George Mason University who specializes in AI policy.\nDeep Research is available as part of all paid ChatGPT plans, although most users are capped at 10 queries per month. (People on the $200 ChatGPT Pro plan get 120 queries per month.) It takes a query, such as “Write me a report on the Massachusetts health insurance industry,” or “Tell me about WIRED’s coverage of the Department of Government Efficiency,” and then comes up with a plan, searching for relevant websites, combing through their content, and deciding what links to click and what information deserves further investigation. After exploring for sometimes tens of minutes, it synthesizes its findings into a detailed report, which may include citations, data, and charts.\nMany tools currently branded as AI agents are essentially chatbots connected to simple programs without much sophistication. The Deep Research model itself goes through an artificial kind of reasoning before devising a plan and moving forward with each step. The model provides details of this reasoning behind its research in a side window.\n“Sometimes it’s like ‘I need to backtrack, this doesn't seem that promising,’” says Josh Tobin, another OpenAI researcher involved in building Deep Research. “It’s pretty cool to read some of those trajectories, just to understand how the model is thinking.”\nOpenAI evidently sees Deep Research as a tool that could take on more office work. “This is a thing that we can scale,” Tobin says, adding that the agent could be trained to complete specific white-collar work. An agent with access to a company’s internal data could quickly prepare a report or presentation, for instance. Tobin says the longer goal is to “build an agent that is not just good at building reports through searching the web, but is good at many other types of tasks too.”\nBecause Deep Research was trained to analyze and summarize human-written text, Tobin says his team was surprised to see many people using it to generate code. “It’s an interesting thread to pull,” he says. “We’re not totally sure what to make of it.”\nTobin admits, however, that the tool still has important blind spots. “It may struggle with distinguishing authoritative information from rumors,” he says. “It currently shows a weakness in confidence calibration, often failing to convey uncertainty accurately.\"\nAge of Reasoning\nDeep Research shows how more-capable AI models could automate white-collar work, says Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who studies business adoption of AI.\nMollick, who uses Deep Research regularly, says that although the tool is imperfect and most effective when used by experts who can check its work, it has impressed professionals he has spoken to. “For senior-level people it’s not that it's flawless or that it beats the best people,” Mollick says. “It’s that it can do 40 hours of medium-level work, and it only takes an hour to check,” Mollick says.\nWhether companies will view such tools as a way to augment their workers or simply replace them wholesale remains to be seen. “That's what worries me the most,” Mollick says.\nThe prospect of selling tools that can automate large amounts of highly skilled office work perhaps explains why OpenAI is considering offering advanced agents at a steep premium. The company has told investors that agents capable of doing “PhD-level work” could eventually cost $20,000 per month, according to a recent report from The Information, although details of such a plan remain unclear. OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood describes the report as “purely speculation.”\nBesides hinting at changes in white-collar work, Deep Research illustrates how frontier AI research is increasingly focused on both agents and so-called reasoning models that break problems down into constituent parts in order to better parse and solve them.\nOpenAI’s main rivals are all developing reasoning models of their own, as well as tools similar to Deep Research. Google DeepMind released a web research agent with the same name as OpenAI’s tool on December 10, 2024. Elon Musk’s Grok offers a similar feature.\nDeep Research appears to be the most sophisticated offering currently, partly because it is based on OpenAI’s most advanced reasoning model, called OpenAI o3. While a conventional large language model just generates text in response to a query, Deep Research uses a form of simulated reasoning to decide what actions to take next. Such “agentic” abilities are widely seen as the next evolutionary step for AI, although getting models to take actions without making mistakes remains challenging.\n“Deep Research is a natural extension of these reasoning models,” says Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University who is also working on web agents. Salakhutdinov says, however, that AI agents are still at an early stage, are still error prone, and there is likely to be a lot of experimentation and innovation ahead.\nOpenAI hired graduate students and other highly skilled professionals to help train Deep Research. These users give queries and then correct mistakes, providing training data for a reinforcement learning algorithm that lets the model learn to become a better research assistant.\nWIRED spoke to several Deep Research trainers who also seemed impressed by the tool. “The first thing it does now, it asks for clarification and that's huge,” says Olga Schrivner, a linguist at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology who is helping train Deep Research. “It’s almost like communication, and all of a sudden it becomes like your assistant.”\n“My grandpa is a mathematician,” says Alexander Zerkle, a graduate student in microbiology at UC San Diego who has been providing training data for Deep Research. “He wanted it to prove what's called the Schroeder-Bernstein theorem. I gave that to Deep Research, and it spat out a very long proof. I don't understand any of it, but it's very exciting to him as a mathematician.”\nAs tools like Deep Research become more widespread, they may start to change how many people use the web, even as the mania that accompanied the chatbot boom starts to fade.\nAmelia Glaese, who leads work on alignment at OpenAI, says that no matter how clever a chatbot is, a model that goes beyond generating text by taking actions and does valuable work is a different proposition. “You have a model that has this very big utility—that has learned how to do some of the manual work involved with research,” she says. “Then I think there’s a new set of people that are like, ‘Wow, this is really useful.’”\nHow do you feel about AI agents like Deep Research? Are there tasks you'd be interested to see them perform? Tell me all about it in the comments below.\nUpdate 3/20/25 2:28pm ET: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Isa Fulford's first name and clarify that all paid ChatGPT users can access Deep Research.",

    "content_text": "Nvidia has acquired synthetic data firm Gretel for nine figures, according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal.\nThe acquisition price exceeds Gretel’s most recent valuation of $320 million, the sources say, though the exact terms of the purchase remain unknown. Gretel and its team of approximately 80 employees will be folded into Nvidia, where its technology will be deployed as part of the chip giant’s growing suite of cloud-based, generative AI services for developers.\nThe acquisition comes as Nvidia has been rolling out synthetic data generation tools, so that developers can train their own AI models and fine-tune them for specific apps. In theory, synthetic data could create a near-infinite supply of AI training data and help solve the data scarcity problem that has been looming over the AI industry since ChatGPT went mainstream in 2022—although experts say using synthetic data in generative AI comes with its own risks.\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment.\nGretel was founded in 2019 by Alex Watson, John Myers, and Ali Golshan, who also serves as CEO. The startup offers a synthetic data platform and a suite of APIs to developers who want to build generative AI models, but don’t have access to enough training data or have privacy concerns around using real people’s data. Gretel doesn’t build and license its own frontier AI models, but fine-tunes existing open source models to add differential privacy and safety features, then packages those together to sell them. The company raised more than $67 million in venture capital funding prior to the acquisition, according to Pitchbook.\nA spokesperson for Gretel also declined to comment.\nUnlike human-generated or real-world data, synthetic data is computer-generated and designed to mimic real-world data. Proponents say this makes the data generation required to build AI models more scalable, less labor intensive, and more accessible to smaller or less-resourced AI developers. Privacy-protection is another key selling point of synthetic data, making it an appealing option for health care providers, banks, and government agencies.\nNvidia has already been offering synthetic data tools for developers for years. In 2022 it launched Omniverse Replicator, which gives developers the ability to generate custom, physically accurate, synthetic 3D data to train neural networks. Last June, Nvidia began rolling out a family of open AI models that generate synthetic training data for developers to use in building or fine-tuning LLMs. Called Nemotron-4 340B, these mini-models can be used by developers to drum up synthetic data for their own LLMs across “health care, finance, manufacturing, retail, and every other industry.”\nDuring his keynote presentation at Nvidia’s annual developer conference this Tuesday, Nvidia cofounder and chief executive Jensen Huang spoke about the challenges the industry faces in rapidly scaling AI in a cost-effective way.\n“There are three problems that we focus on,” he said. “One, how do you solve the data problem? How and where do you create the data necessary to train the AI? Two, what’s the model architecture? And then three, what are the scaling laws?” Huang went on to describe how the company is now using synthetic data generation in its robotics platforms.\nSynthetic data can be used in at least a couple different ways, says Ana-Maria Cretu, a postdoctoral researcher at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, who studies synthetic data privacy. It can take the form of tabular data, like demographic or medical data, which can solve a data scarcity issue or create a more diverse dataset.\nCretu gives an example: If a hospital wants to build an AI model to track a certain type of cancer, but is working with a small data set from 1,000 patients, synthetic data can be used to fill out the data set, eliminate biases, and anonymize data from real humans. “This also offers some privacy protection, whenever you cannot disclose the real data to a stakeholder or software partner,” Cretu says.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former Nvidia employee who wants to talk? Or someone who has the inside track on the world of startups and VC in the Valley? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at ChaoticGoode.12.\nBut in the world of large language models, Cretu adds, synthetic data has also become something of a catchall phase for “How can we just increase the amount of data we have for LLMs over time?”\nExperts worry that, in the not-so-distant future, AI companies won’t be able to gorge as freely on human-created internet data in order to train their AI models. Last year, a report from MIT’s Data Provenance Initiative showed that restrictions around open web content were increasing.\nSynthetic data in theory could provide an easy solution. But a July 2024 article in Nature highlighted how AI language models could “collapse,” or degrade significantly in quality, when they’re fine-tuned over and over again with data generated by other models. Put another way, if you feed the machine nothing but its own machine-generated output, it theoretically begins to eat itself, spewing out detritus as a result.\nAlexandr Wang, the chief executive of Scale AI—which leans heavily on a human workforce for labeling data used to train models—shared the findings from the Nature article on X, writing, “While many researchers today view synthetic data as an AI philosopher’s stone, there is no free lunch.” Wang said later in the thread that this is why he believes firmly in a hybrid data approach.\nOne of Gretel’s cofounders pushed back on the Nature paper, noting in a blog post that the “extreme scenario” of repetitive training on purely synthetic data “is not representative of real-world AI development practices.”\nGary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and researcher who loudly criticizes AI hype, said at the time that he agrees with Wang’s “diagnosis but not his prescription.” The industry will move forward, he believes, by developing new architectures for AI models, rather than focusing on the idiosyncrasies of data sets. In an email to WIRED, Marcus observed that “systems like [OpenAI's] o1/o3 seem to be better at domains like coding and math where you can generate—and validate—tons of synthetic data. On general purpose reasoning in open-ended domains, they have been less effective.\"\nCretu believes the scientific theory around model collapse is sound. But she notes that most researchers and computer scientists are training on a mix of synthetic and real-world data. “You might possibly be able to get around model collapse by having fresh data with every new round of training,” she says.\nConcerns about model collapse haven’t stopped the AI industry from hopping aboard the synthetic data train, even if they’re doing so with caution. At a recent Morgan Stanley tech conference, Sam Altman reportedly touted OpenAI’s ability to use its existing AI models to create more data. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said he believes it may be possible to build “an infinite data-generation engine,” one that would maintain its quality by injecting a small amount of new information during the training process (as Cretu has suggested).\nBig Tech has also been turning to synthetic data. Meta has talked about how it trained Llama 3, its state-of-the-art large language model, using synthetic data, some of which was generated from Meta’s previous model, Llama 2. Amazon’s Bedrock platform lets developers use Anthropic’s Claude to generate synthetic data. Microsoft’s Phi-3 small language model was trained partly on synthetic data, though the company has warned that “synthetic data generated by pre-trained large-language models can sometimes reduce accuracy and increase bias on down-stream tasks.” Google’s DeepMind has been using synthetic data, too, but again, has highlighted the complexities of developing a pipeline for generating—and maintaining—truly private synthetic data.\n“We know that all of the big tech companies are working on some aspect of synthetic data,” says Alex Bestall, the founder of Rightsify, a music licensing startup that also generates AI music and licenses its catalog for AI models. “But human data is often a contractual requirement in our deals. They might want a dataset that is 60 percent human-generated, and 40 percent synthetic.”",

Last June, Nvidia began rolling out a family of open AI models that generate synthetic training data for developers to use in building or fine-tuning LLMs. Called Nemotron-4 340B, these mini-models can be used by developers to drum up synthetic data for their own LLMs across “health care, finance, manufacturing, retail, and every other industry.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">During his keynote presentation at Nvidia’s annual developer conference this Tuesday, Nvidia cofounder and chief executive Jensen Huang spoke about the challenges the industry faces in rapidly scaling AI in a cost-effective way.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“There are three problems that we focus on,” he said. “One, how do you solve the data problem? How and where do you create the data necessary to train the AI? Two, what’s the model architecture? And then three, what are the scaling laws?” Huang went on to describe how the company is now using synthetic data generation in its robotics platforms.</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "The Best Vinyl Accessories to Jazz Up Your Analog Audio\nAll products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nWhether you've just started spinning analog audio or you’ve been building a collection for years, good vinyl accessories can take your enjoyment—and your records’ longevity—to the next level. I’ve spent the better part of the past decade messing with some of the most lauded tools for cleaning, setting up, and maintaining record players, and these are my favorites. Plenty of these accessories are affordable, and they make great gifts.\nBefore you dive deeper, I recommend watching this video on proper turntable setup. Many of the accessories below are meant to help you get the most out of your gear. For more, check out How to Shop for Vinyl Online and How to Clean Vinyl, or our guides on the Best Turntables or Best Bookshelf Speakers.\nUpdated March 2025: We've added an ultrasonic record cleaner, Sennheiser HD6XX, and Focal Theva No. 1.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nA Quality Brush\nBoundless Audio\nRecord Brush\nA nice antistatic carbon-fiber brush will help you dust off your records before a spin. I like this one from Boundless because it has a sleek gray color, but any similar-looking brush will do. A tip for gift givers: You can never really have too many. I lose them about as often as I misplace my TV remote.\nA Stylus Cleaner\nKaiu\nGel Stylus Cleaner\nEven with clean records and a dust brush, your needle will eventually get a bit gunky. There are brushes and cleaning solutions to deal with this, but I've always found it scary to rub them on my delicate stylus. Instead, I like gel-based cleaners like this one from Kaiu. You drop your needle into the sticky goo and it gobbles up any junk around it. You'll get a few hundred drops out of one before it needs replacing. It comes in a wooden storage case with a magnetizing mirror on the lid—great for seeing just how gunky that needle really is.\nA Stylus Scale\nNeotek\nDigital Turntable Stylus Force Scale\nEvery stylus has a recommended tracking force (the downward pressure it exerts on your record). The tracking force is typically set by turning the counterweight on the back of the tonearm. You'll often find markings on turntables to indicate relative tracking force so you can set it manually, but I never trust myself. For less than $15, use this tiny little scale to get it right. Peace of mind doesn't often come this cheap.\nA Good Level\nCraftsman\nTorpedo Level (9-Inch)\nA key component to records sounding good is a proper turntable setup. For that, you'll want to make sure you have a good level. If your turntable isn't perfectly flat, you can typically adjust it using the feet attached to the bottom. In a pinch, you can use playing cards or another object to adjust the feet even higher if that's necessary for level playback.\nA Little Weight\nHudson Hi-Fi\nBig Ben Record Weight\nRecord weights hold your records to the platter more securely, and the added mass may help with bass response. You'll find super expensive ones when you shop for ’em, but don't be fooled: They’re basically just hunks of metal with a hole in the bottom. Pick one that you like (or drill a hole in a hockey puck) and move on.\nA Rubber Mat\nFeir\nRubber Platter Mat\nThere is a lot of debate about what the best material is for optimal anti-slip and antistatic performance, but between cork, felt, and rubber, I'd choose the latter. It's the most durable, it sticks to the surface of your records for good grip, and this one even has some grooves to make it easier to lay perfectly flat on your disc.\nFor Grimy Finds\nRecord Rescue\nRecord Roller\nCrate digging and used record shopping is one of the joys of the analog audio hobby, but the vast majority of records you'll pull from the bin are pretty nasty. Before you give something a test play, save your gear by giving it a once-over with this lint-roller-like device. It will get all the biggest, grossest stuff out of the way of your stylus, so you don't mess up your (or the shop's!) gear.\nCheapest Record Cleaner\nVinyl Vac 33 Combo Record Cleaning Kit\nA record roller is fine for surface cleaning, but the only way to really get into the grooves of a record is with a cleaning solution that is then sucked out by a vacuum. Grooves are too small for the fibers of cloth to reach all the way inside. If you're on a budget, get a small wet/dry vacuum, an old broken turntable, and this Vinyl Vac kit. It attaches to the hose of your vacuum to suck all the gunk out when you're done wiping down a side with the included solution. I've used this method many times to great effect. You'll be surprised how great clean records sound!\nBest All-in-One Cleaner\nPro-Ject Audio\nVC-E Record Cleaning Machine\nIf you don't want to go the do-it-yourself route mentioned above, then try the Pro-Ject Audio VC-E. It's not cheap, but it spins in two directions to ensure full suction from the powerful internal vacuum, and it has a nice screw-down clamp that keeps a record's label dry while you're giving it a wash.\nFor Cleaning a Collection\nWEWU Rounds\nVinyl Record Ultrasonic Cleaner\nIf you need to clean more than one record at once—say, you've never actually cleaned any of your discs and have hundreds—the best way I've found is to use an ultrasonic cleaner like this one. It heats a cleaning solution and vibrates at a very high frequency, allowing grime to simply fall off the surface of the grooves. It works amazingly well, and you can load up to five records at once on the rotating spindle, for easier batch cleaning. Even better, when you're not cleaning records you can take off the motorized spindle and use it to clean anything else you want, from rings to old silverware.\nProtect Your Investment\nInvest In Vinyl\nInner Record Sleeves (50)\nThe paper inserts that come with most records are annoying to get in and out of sleeves, and they're not as good at protecting your vinyl as aftermarket ones like these. A rice paper lining means your discs easily slide in and out of these jackets, and arrows printed on the sleeves let you always know which way is which.\nA Record Display\nFlipbin\nModel 33\nThe Flipbin is an attractive combo of a storage case and a “now playing” display for your records. Each colored bin holds around 33 records—depending on thickness—and is made of durable metal that will last a lifetime.\nPack ’Em In\nIf you're always buying new records, it can quickly become hard to find a place to store them all. This cube-shaped bin from Tavenly is a great expandable solution to the LP hoarder problem—it is even strong enough to double as a stand for your record player, if space is limited.\nPortable Storage\nVaultz\nRecord Storage Box\nIf you bring your records to a club or parties, you probably want to keep folks' grubby hands off your collection. For that, we recommend this adorable teal lockbox. You'll know it's yours from the color (and the label you can put on the front), and it will keep your records safe from spills, tumbles, and competitors trying to bite your style.\nAn Outboard Phono Preamp\nPro-Ject Audio\nPhono Box DC Preamplifier\nTurntables put out a low-level signal that needs to be amplified to the “line-level” signal your amplifier is used to seeing. Most cheap turntables have a middling built-in phono preamp, but this button-less box from Pro-Ject is a great upgrade. It's also great if you have a turntable without a phono preamp, which allows you to connect it to any amplifier, even if it doesn't have a dedicated phono channel. I like this model, which adds a bit more clarity than what you'll hear from typical built-in preamps.\nA Better Preamp\nCambridge Audio\nAlva Solo\nThe Pro-Ject Phono Box sounds solid, but if you want even more clarity and life in your music, I recommend this excellent preamp from Cambridge Audio. It has great subsonic filtering for more worn discs, and it feels like every record you play through it has a bit more shine.\nExcellent New Speakers\nFocal\nTheva No. 1\nIf you are looking to upgrade your overall listening experience, we really love these gorgeous French bookshelf speakers from Focal. They sound smooth and warm, with a buttery low end that never becomes muddy. They work very well with any modern amp, which means that you'll have no problem powering them with nearly anything you have on hand—no upgrade there. The classic wood finish also works very well with analog audio.\nFor Quiet Listening\nSennheiser\nHD6XX\nThese open-backed headphones from Sennheiser are considered audiophile classics. They sound shockingly good for the money and are the perfect accessory for late-night listening if you live in an apartment, condo, dorm, bedroom, or other shared listening space. These are among the most comfortable headphones you can buy, which makes them fantastic for extended listening sessions. Because they’re open-backed, you'll get much more of a soundstage in your music, but the downside is that noises from the outside world will leak in.\nA Fresh Cartridge\nOrtofon\n2M Red\nIf you are still rocking the cartridge that came with your turntable, this nice cartridge from Ortofon is a great upgrade or replacement if yours seems like it's getting tired. Most manufacturers recommend replacing your cartridge after about 200 hours of playtime, so if you listen to a lot of records often, it's worth swapping out yours. Worth noting: your stylus will last longer if it is always spinning across clean records!\nAcoustic Treatment\nATS\nAcoustic Panels\nYour room matters just as much as your gear. Consider adding acoustic panels like these to the first reflection points—where the sound energy from your speakers first hits the wall and reflects back to your ears. Doing so will open up your soundstage considerably and help the speakers better disappear into your musical space.\nStrut Your Stuff\nKoeppel Design\nThe LP Block\nThe biggest problem with most “now playing\" record holders is that they're not thick enough. Special edition music releases with multiple disks make the whole thing much chunkier than normal. You won't have any trouble fitting them on this gorgeous LP holder from Koeppel design, which can hold up to 10 records for easy analog playlisting. It even has “Now Spinning” etched in the top.\nFor Heavy-Footed Neighbors\nSound Isolation Pads\nI've never found that shock-absorbing feet for my turntable make it sound better, but I have found that they make for a better time for those who have heavy-footed neighbors. Feet like these can help reduce skips and bounces, and these are a good, cheap option. Don't be fooled by versions that cost many times as much. These are just fine.\nBooks About Records\nOne analog format compliments another, right? Below are some books about records:\nDust & Grooves, by Elion Paz (forward by RZA) : This coffee table book showcases some 250 record collections, including those of famous musicians like Questlove and RZA.\nVinyl Junkies: Adventures in Record Collecting, by Brett Milano: This early-2000s book features interviews with indie rock heroes like Thurston Moore, Peter Buck, and cartoonist Robert Crumb, among others.\nAround the World in 80 Record Stores, by Marcus Barnes: This book showcases some of the coolest and most specialized record stores, boasting picks from “Iceland to India.”\nA Record of My Vinyl: A Collector's Catalog: This is a blank book with spaces for personal liner notes, disc cleaning tips, tips for evaluating records, and a few perforated pages that you can tear off and take with you to the record store. It's a helpful accessory if you want a specialized notebook for your stuff.\nWired Coupons\n10% off Dell Coupon Code for New Customers\nSamsung Promo Code: 10% off TVs\nBusiness PCs - Extra 5% Off HP Coupon Code\n10% off Canon promo code with upgrade\nExclusive NordVPN Coupon: 76% off\nLG Promo Code: 20% Off Your First Order",

The astronauts had not planned to spend more than two weeks in space, but technical issues with Starliner thwarted that plan.\nAs it approached the space station, some of Starliner’s thrusters stopped working. Although the Boeing spacecraft managed to dock at the ISS, NASA preferred not to take any risks with its return and opted to send Starliner back to Earth without crew on board.

    "content_text": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nExactly one month after Apple unveiled the iPhone 16e, Google is taking the wraps off its lower-cost smartphone, the Pixel 9a. Unlike Apple's handset, the Pixel 9a doesn't come with a price increase—it still costs $499 like its predecessor. The biggest change is its design, but there are a few notable spec updates across the board, alongside smart features that debuted on the Pixel 9.\nGoogle originally said the Pixel 9a would be available for preorder today and ship on March 26. However, at the last minute, the company stated the new handset wouldn't go on sale until April and didn't offer any more details. While we wait for the new release date, here's everything we know about the Pixel 9a, the latest in a series that has frequently been our favorite smartphone to recommend for most people.\nFlat Camera\nGone is the iconic camera visor that made Pixel phones easy to distinguish over the past few years. Instead, there's a horizontal camera module that sits alone very much like an iPhone 8 Plus.\nGoogle says while it originally didn't set out to make a flat camera module, the company found itself within shooting distance during the design phase and decided to go for it. It makes the phone look nondescript, with the peony and iris colors doing some heavy lifting. But hey, at least the completely flat design means the phone won't rock on a table.\nEverything you'd expect to find in a successor to the excellent Pixel 8A is here. Like a larger 6.3-inch pOLED screen that also gets brighter—up to 2,700 nits at peak brightness. The screen retains its 120-Hz refresh rate, a feature you won't find on the pricier iPhone 16e. The phone's IP rating has been bumped to IP68 (up from IP67), which means it can survive submersion underwater for longer periods. But the biggest spec upgrade is the battery.\n|Specs\n|Display: 6.3-inch, 120-Hz, pOLED\n|Processor and RAM: Tensor G4 with 8 GB RAM\n|Storage: 128- and 256-GB options\n|Battery: 5,100 mAh\n|Cameras: 48-MP main camera, 13-MP ultrawide, 13-MP selfie camera\n|Updates (from date of manufacture): 7 years\n|Extras: Qi wireless charging, IP68, fingerprint and secure face unlock, NFC\n|Carrier compatibility: Works on all three major US networks\n|Colors: Peony, Iris, Obsidian, Porcelain\n|Price: $499\nBattery life has historically been a weak point on Google's Pixel A-series phones, so Google has stuffed a 5,100-mAh cell into the Pixel 9a. That's the biggest battery capacity we've seen on a Pixel yet, and Google claims 30-plus hours on a single charge. Also in tow is wireless charging, though it's still the basic Qi variant and not the new and improved Qi2.\nAt the heart of the phone is the Tensor G4 processor, the very same that's inside the flagship Pixel 9 Pro series, with 8 GB of RAM. That should mean excellent performance, especially compared to what you'll find on other sub-$500 Android phones, not to mention 7 years of software support. This chip also drives many of the phone's artificial intelligence features, and allows the Pixel 9a to take advantage of all the same AI camera tricks introduced on the Pixel 9 smartphones in 2024.\nThat includes Add Me, which lets the person taking the photo join in on the action by switching places with the subject. The software stitches two images so that both parties are in the same photo despite not standing next to each other at that precise moment. The Pixel 9a can also create a short astrophotography timelapse, and there's even Macro Focus, which enables a macro mode via the main camera to take crisp photos of objects up close, like insects or plants. The camera system is driven by a revamped 48-megapixel primary camera joined by a 13-MP ultrawide, and a 13-MP selfie camera.\nNaturally, Google is touting all of its Gemini AI features in this phone, one of which is a new addition announced at Mobile World Congress a few weeks ago and rolling out soon—live video in Gemini Live conversations. This lets you ask Gemini anything about the subject you’re looking at through the phone’s camera, powered by the company’s Astra technology (though this feature is limited to people on Google’s Gemini Advanced subscription).\nAlso new, but not strictly only available on the Pixel 9a, is the ability to generate images of people in the Pixel Studio app. This was a self-imposed restriction Google had before but now it’s gone, though it has kept certain guardrails on what you can generate. Lastly, if you’re moving over from another phone like an iPhone, you can bring your audio recordings with you and the Google Recorder app will automatically transcribe them. One less barrier to transition.\nIn the Android world, the Pixel 9a is competing against Nothing's latest Phone (3a) series, which costs a little less. Nothing's devices lack some capabilities—like no wireless charging and not as powerful performance—but they also have some perks, like the 3X optical telephoto camera. Samsung also recently announced a midrange phone, the Galaxy A56 for $500, though it's not arriving until later this year.\nWe'll update this story when Google shares a precise preorder and release date for the Pixel 9a. (Update: Google says the Pixel 9a will be available on April 10 in the US, Canada, and the UK. Other countries will follow the week after.)",

    "content_text": "Neurotech company Synchron has unveiled the latest version of its brain-computer interface, which uses Nvidia technology and the Apple Vision Pro to enable individuals with paralysis to control digital and physical environments with their thoughts.\nIn a video demonstration at the Nvidia GTC conference this week in San Jose, California, Synchron showed off how its system allows one of its trial participants, Rodney Gorham, who is paralyzed, to control multiple devices in his home. From his sun-filled living room in Melbourne, Australia, Gorham is able to play music from a smart speaker, adjust the lighting, turn on a fan, activate an automatic pet feeder, and run a robotic vacuum.\nGorham has lost the use of his voice and much of his body due to having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. The degenerative disease weakens muscles over time and eventually leads to paralysis. He received Synchron’s implantable brain-computer interface, or BCI, in 2020. He could initially use his BCI to type on a computer, iPhone, and iPad. Now, using the Apple Vision Pro, he can look at various devices in his home and see a drop-down menu overlaid on his physical environment. With his BCI, he can then select from various actions, such as adjusting the temperature on his air-conditioning unit just by thinking.\nBCIs decode signals from brain activity and translate them into commands on an output device. To improve the speed and accuracy of decoding, Synchron is using Nvidia’s Holoscan, an AI sensor-processing platform. Faster and more accurate decoding would mean a shorter delay between a user’s intended movement and the time it takes for a BCI system to execute a command, plus more precise control.\nExcitement for BCIs has been building in recent years as Elon Musk’s Neuralink and other companies have emerged to commercialize what was once clunky technology used in academic labs into practical assistive devices. Though they’re still experimental, implantable BCIs are showing promise at restoring some lost functionalities to people with paralysis.\nBut most demonstrations of BCIs have been of one-off capabilities—playing a video game, moving a robotic arm, or piloting a drone, for instance. Synchron is aiming to build a BCI system able to seamlessly perform a wide range of tasks in the home environment. “It’s running in real time, in a real environment 24/7, making predictions where context really matters,” Tom Oxley, Synchron’s CEO, told WIRED in an exclusive interview.\nTo do that, Synchron’s BCI will need to be trained on a lot of brain data. As part of its collaboration with Nvidia, the two companies are developing what Oxley has dubbed “cognitive AI,” the combination of large amounts of brain data with advanced computing to create more intuitive BCI systems. Oxley sees cognitive AI as the next phase of AI development following agentic AI, which can act and make decisions independently, and physical AI, the integration of AI with robots and other physical systems.\n“What we saw Rodney do is a start, but there are so many more interactions that you can actually begin bringing here,” says David Niewolny, senior director of health care and medtech at Nvidia. With cognitive AI, he says, the mind will be the “ultimate user interface.”\nCurrently, BCIs are trained with data from a single person. An individual with a BCI is asked to perform a specific task, such as thinking about moving a cursor left or right. An electrode array collects neural activity from the brain while the person is doing that task and researchers “label” that brain data. In other words, they indicate what the subject was doing at each time point that the brain signal was being measured. That labeled data is used to build an AI model that learns to relate that specific pattern of brain activity to a movement intention.\nTo achieve its vision of cognitive AI, Synchron plans to use brain data from its current and future trial participants to build an AI model. Maryam Shanechi, a BCI researcher at the University of Southern California and founding director of its Center for Neurotechnology, says a brain foundation model could improve the accuracy of Synchron’s BCI and allow it to perform a more diverse set of functions without having to collect hours of training data from individual patients.\n“This model would be more generalizable, more accurate, and then you can fine-tune it in each subject,” she says. “Because this AI has been trained on the brains of many people, it has essentially learned how to learn, how to think, and then you have this brainlike AI system that you can use for a variety of tasks.”\nSome training will still be needed for each new BCI user. Users learn how to operate a BCI with prompts such as “squeeze your fist” or “press down like a brake pedal.” A paralyzed person may not be able to make that motion, but the neurons in their brain’s motor cortex still fire up when they attempt to do so. Those intended movement signals are what BCIs decode. Oxley says Synchron will use Cosmos, Nvidia’s new family of AI models, to generate photorealistic simulations of the user’s body, allowing them to watch an avatar of their own movement and mentally rehearse it.\nCosmos can also generate tokens about each avatar movement that act like time stamps, which will be used to label brain data. Labeling data enables an AI model to accurately interpret and decode brain signals and then translate those signals into the intended action.\nAll of this data will be used to train a brain foundation model, a large deep-learning neural network that can be adapted to a wide range of uses rather than needing to be trained on each new task.\n“As we get more and more data, these foundation models get better and become more generalizable,” Shanechi says. “The issue is that you need a lot of data for these foundation models to actually become foundational.” That is difficult to achieve with invasive technology that few people will receive, she says.\nSynchron’s device is less invasive than many of its competitors’. Neuralink and other companies’ electrode arrays sit in the brain or on the brain’s surface. Synchron’s array is a mesh tube that’s inserted at the base of the neck and threaded through a vein to read activity from the motor cortex. The procedure, which is similar to implanting a heart stent in an artery, doesn’t require brain surgery.\n“The big advantage here is that we know how to do stents in the millions around the globe. In every part of the world, there’s enough talent to go do stents. A normal cath lab can do this. So it’s a scalable procedure,” says Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, one of Synchron’s investors. As many as 2 million people in the United States alone receive stents every year to prop open their coronary arteries to prevent heart disease.\nSynchron has surgically implanted its BCI in 10 subjects since 2019 and has collected several years’ worth of brain data from those people. The company is getting ready to launch a larger clinical trial that is needed to seek commercial approval of its device. There have been no large-scale trials of implanted BCIs because of the risks of brain surgery and the cost and complexity of the technology.\nSynchron’s goal of creating cognitive AI is ambitious, and it doesn’t come without risks.\n“What I see this technology enabling more immediately is the possibility of more control over more in the environment,” says Nita Farahany, a professor of law and philosophy at Duke University who has written extensively about the ethics of BCIs. In the longer term, Farahany says that as these AI models get more sophisticated, they could go beyond detecting intentional commands to predicting or making suggestions about what a person might want to do with their BCI.\n“To enable people to have that kind of seamless integration or self-determination over their environment, it requires being able to decode not just intentionally communicated speech or intentional motor commands, but being able to detect that earlier,” she says.\nIt gets into sticky territory about how much autonomy a user has and whether the AI is acting consistently with the individual’s desires. And it raises questions about whether a BCI could shift someone’s own perception, thoughts, or intentionality.\nOxley says those concerns are already arising with generative AI. Using ChatGPT for content creation, for instance, blurs the lines between what a person creates and what AI creates. “I don't think that problem is particularly special to BCI,” he says.\nFor people with the use of their hands and voice, correcting AI-generated material—like autocorrect on your phone—is no big deal. But what if a BCI does something that a user didn’t intend? “The user will always be driving the output,” Oxley says. But he recognizes the need for some kind of option that would allow humans to override an AI-generated suggestion. “There's always going to have to be a kill switch.”",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nFeatured in this article\nI'm the queen of putting on my makeup in weird places on a time crunch. Whether in a passenger seat, on a plane, or in a tent at a festival, I’ve done a full glam in minutes. I even taught a class to my WIRED colleagues on how to get ready in a hurry. I am, for better or for worse, that girl.\nSo it makes sense that I would test the ultimate in It Girl innovation. I'm talking about lighted makeup mirrors, including my favorite—the Fancii Taylor ($46). These mirrors shine a light on your face so you can see it from all angles (and in some cases, they have magnification that will show you every single pore, whether or not you want to see it). You'll be able to use the power of Seeing Correctly to ensure a flawless finish, whether you're going with heavy contour or a smoky cut crease like it's 2016 again, or you simply want to make sure your overlined lips aren't too obvious.\nBe sure to check out our related guides, including the Best LED Face Masks, Best Hair Straighteners, Best Curling Irons, Best Diffusers for Curly Hair, and the Best Beauty Subscription Boxes.\nUpdated March 2025: We’ve added two new makeup mirrors, the Simplehuman Sensor Mirror Trio and the Impressions Vanity Touch Pro, and updated pricing and ensured accuracy throughout.\nAbout CRI (Color Rendering Index)\nSome lighted makeup mirrors feature specific CRI (Color Rendering Index) measurements. It's a way to measure how closely artificial light can mimic natural light (like daylight). The scale goes from 0 to 100, with 100 being the perfect indication that colors appear the same as they would in natural sunlight. I think this is a nice thing to know about, but ultimately, your environment will affect your makeup application more than a mirror's CRI score (if listed). Placing your lighted makeup mirror in front of a window or in a well-lit area will give you just as good of an idea of how your makeup looks in any room. Once my makeup is finished, I usually cycle through any mirror's available lighting schemes to ensure it looks good in all of them. So, in a nutshell, a high CRI is a good indication of a mirror's color accuracy, but it's not the only thing you need to care about.\nHow We Tested\nI completed my go-to makeup look (sparkly nude eyeshadow, winged liner, lots of blush and highlight, penciled-in brows, heavy mascara) using each of these mirrors at least twice—once in a dark environment, and once in natural daylight. I tested each lighting mode and fully cycled through every battery at least once.\nMirrors We Don’t Recommend\nThe Impressions Vanity Touch Pro for $109: This vanity mirror seems great on paper. It’s nonportable and fully adjustable thanks to the ball-joint attachment, and it even has a Bluetooth speaker and a battery built in so you can use it to charge your phone or other gadgets. Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite hit the mark on any of its stated features. The little lights dotting the edge of the mirror don’t offer the bright, diffused light that ring lights have. The built-in speaker is worse than my phone’s built-in speaker—I tested it with my dubstep-heavy “Getting Ready” playlist and thought the cheap plastic housing might rattle apart. The battery barely topped off my iPhone 13 Pro Max while I was doing my makeup. I do like the large 12-inch mirror design, but I think this pick is overpriced. I was going to say that it’d be good for kids, but you’d be better off getting a less expensive mirror, Bluetooth speaker, and power bank rather than trying to roll them all into one device.",

So, in a nutshell, a high CRI is a good indication of a mirror's color accuracy, but it's not the only thing you need to care about.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf\"><div class=\"AccordionContainer-foSklP iRHdCZ\"><div class=\"AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY\" data-testid=\"accordion-item-container\"><button class=\"BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ gTIqfM hKIiJv button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"Button\"}' data-testid=\"Button\" role=\"button\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label\">AccordionItemContainerButton</span></button></div><div class=\"AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb leTzLN opening-animation\"><div><p>I completed my go-to makeup look (sparkly nude eyeshadow, winged liner, lots of blush and highlight, penciled-in brows, heavy mascara) using each of these mirrors at least twice—once in a dark environment, and once in natural daylight.

    "content_text": "Billy Basso was glued to his computer. It was launch day for the Chicago developer’s debut solo game, a surreal Metroidvania called Animal Well, and he couldn’t stop reading reviews online and watching people play the game. He’d pulled off the impossible: breaking through a turbulent industry to create a hit game that would grow to be a critical and commercial success. He just didn’t realize how big of one it would be quite yet.\nMost successful video games are made by teams of people that vary in size from a half dozen to somewhere in the hundreds. Basso had made Animal Well entirely on his own, start to finish. Music, art, story—it was all his, dictated by the singular goal to finish the game.\nHe thought it would take six months. It took seven years. “My entire life has completely changed since the game has come out,” Basso, 36, says.\nThis year, Animal Well is up for five awards at the Game Developers Choice Awards, including prizes for Best Design, Best Audio, and Best Debut. The awards are being handed out this week at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where Basso is also a featured speaker. At a talk on Monday detailing the nitty gritty of how he made the game, from coding to describing the game’s lighting, Basso held court in front of a rapt audience packed to the brim. Attendees laughed and “ooh’d” his presentation. While describing some of his more homebrew methods of development, one developer in the audience whispered “this guy is the GOAT.” After his talk, a circle of fans surrounded Basso to offer praise and ask questions.\nBasso had arrived. It just took some time to get there.\nBasso wasn’t a new developer when he started Animal Well. He’d worked at large companies before, including a stint at NetherRealm working on mobile versions of Mortal Kombat. He was working at a medical startup that created mobile games for doctors—”as weird and niche as you might expect”—and tinkered with his own projects at night. He’d spent a decade of his career with “the desire to make something that I would actually be a fan of.”\nFor four years, Basso worked on a primitive version of Animal Well in his free time, supporting himself with his day job. “It was very clearly a self-indulgent side project for myself,” he told me in an interview. But as the game grew more sophisticated, and Basso invested more time into it, he started to think of it differently. “It gradually started to seem more like something I could actually release, that I could maybe make a living off of,” he says.\nBasso gathered his confidence and plotted an exit from his day job. His family didn’t quite understand his ambitions. “My dad didn't want me to quit my job to work on it,” Basso says. “They were worried that I should keep a full-time job.”\nThen, in 2021, a turning point: Basso got in touch with Dan Adelman, an industry vet known on the business development side, for help. “I was kind of an introverted person that doesn't feel very comfortable posting things online and marketing the game,” Basso says. Adelman is well known for running Nintendo of America’s indie program and championing small developers. “Luckily enough, he was into the project,” Basso says. “He wanted to start working together and then, from that point forward, I felt like I just became a much luckier person.”\nBasso and Adelman began applying to events like Day of the Devs, an indie showcase, to let people see the game. Their efforts paid off, with Bigmode—the publisher run by YouTuber videogamedunkey—signing Animal Well. “A little less than a year after working with Dan, I had saved up enough money and had a road map to finishing the game,” Basso says. He quit his job to focus on Animal Well full-time. “It ended up still being about three years until it was done,” he says.\nOver the many years of Animal Well’s development, friends urged him to release what he had when interest seemed to be high. “I knew where the quality bar was for myself and what people expect out of a game,” Basso says. He didn’t like the idea of “cashing out” on what he felt wasn’t a complete project, despite the long years that had gone into it. “It was hard to explain how much work actually goes into releasing a polished game,” Basso says. “You can't just kind of put pencils down at any point and click the release button on Steam.” How his game debuted mattered. If people like it, “they'll trust you in the future to buy one of another game.”\nHis bet had paid off. With Animal Well’s success, Basso says he’s now able to “make whatever arbitrary thing I want and not really have to worry about whether it will sell well or not.” All that matters, he says, is “I find it fun.” In the game industry of 2025—where funding has been scarce, even studios with popular projects close down, and devs are being laid off en masse—that kind of freedom is a rarity. “There's so much pressure to chase trends and put AI in your game,” Basso says. “Or, if you're trying to raise money, you kind of have to pander to a different crowd of investors that are totally out of touch.”\nBasso is already working on his next project in earnest—a 2D sidescroller that will share some elements of Animal Well—though he’s only about six months into it. He says that while it won’t be a direct sequel, “I think it’s something people who enjoyed Animal Well will also enjoy. It will have its own identity.”\nIt’s too early to share much else about the game, to Basso’s relief. “I'm back in the good, pure phase where I just get to make something on my own, without sharing it with anybody. I guess I'll relish that for the next few years.” Still, Basso says he finds it flattering when people ask about his next game, which he says will likely be even more ambitious.\n“Animal Well took seven years,” he says. “I don't think this next project will take nearly as long. Hopefully.”",

Now, Roku is testing what it might look like if it took things a step further and forced people to watch a video ad play before getting to the Roku OS home screen.\nReports of Roku customers seeing video ads automatically play before they could view the OS’ home screen started appearing online this week. A Reddit user, for example, posted yesterday: “I just turned on my Roku and got an ... ad for a movie, before I got to the regular Roku home screen.” Multiple apparent users reported seeing an ad for the movie Moana 2. The ads have a close option, but some users appear to have not seen it.\nWhen reached for comment, a Roku spokesperson shared a company statement that confirms that the autoplaying ads are expected behavior but not a permanent part of Roku OS currently. Instead, Roku claimed, it was just trying the ad capability out.\nRoku’s representative said that Roku’s business “has and will always require continuous testing and innovation across design, navigation, content, and our first-rate advertising products,” adding: “Our recent test is just the latest example, as we explore new ways to showcase brands and programming while still providing a delightful and simple user experience.”\nRoku didn't respond to requests for comment on whether it has plans to make autoplaying ads permanent on Roku OS, which devices are affected, why Roku decided to use autoplaying ads, or customer backlash.\n“Unacceptable”\nMost of the comments that Ars Technica has reviewed about the marketing “test” have suggested that customers would get rid of their Roku device if the software continues to force them to watch an ad before getting to the content they actually want to see.\nA user on Roku’s community forum wrote, “I hope this was a fluke. I trashed all of my Amazon boxes years ago because of this garbage. If it keeps up, my Rokus will be next.”\nForum users who worried the change was permanent called the ads “unacceptable” and “intrusive.”\nIf Roku increases its ad load on customer devices from still images to ads with moving pictures with sound, it will test customers’ limits. Some who have tolerated a static image on a neglected part of their screen may not be as accepting of more distracting ad formats.\n“I could accept the static ad on the side. Forcing a loud commercial is awful,” one Redditor wrote.\nAs a budget streaming hardware brand, Roku has been known to push the boundaries on ads. Roku has even gone so far as to apply for a patent for technology that shows ads over anything you plug into your TV (Roku has never actually implemented this capability).\nThere are less ad-intrusive smart TV platforms available besides Roku. But in general, it’s getting increasingly difficult for smart TV users to avoid ads. All TV manufacturers, from budget brands to premium ones, are growing reliance on ads and tracking as ways to bolster revenue among declining hardware prices, sales, and innovation and increased competition.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

    "content_text": "Tesla has been granted a permit to operate a taxi service in California, a spokesperson for the California Public Utilities Commission, a state regulator, said Tuesday. It marks the first step towards Tesla’s and CEO Elon Musk’s vision of operating a driverless taxi service in the state.\nOne day, Musk has said, Tesla owners should be able to rent out their cars as sort of self-driving Ubers while they’re not using them. He has said current owners should be able to operate their Models 3 and Y autonomously in the state later this year—a plan that faces both technological and regulatory hurdles.\nBut despite the permit, Tesla’s driverless taxi future still seems far off in California, which has the perfect climate for self-driving cars but some of the strictest regulatory requirements in the US for testing and operating them. The permit does not allow Tesla to transport passengers in driverless cars; CPUC spokesperson Terrie Prosper says that the electric carmaker did not apply for its autonomous vehicle programs. Tesla wouldn't be granted such a permit anyway, because it first needs to receive permission from another state regulator, the Department of Motor Services, to offer driverless rides. (The DMV confirmed to WIRED that Tesla has not applied for the necessary permits.)\nThe new permit does allow Tesla to operate a taxi service comprising vehicles with drivers, who will be Tesla employees, according to the CPUC. Initially, the regulator says, Tesla will use the permit to take only Tesla employees on prearranged trips, though it plans to eventually give rides to members of the public.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the permit, or its future driverless plans in California.\nFour companies, including Amazon’s Zoox, hold permits allowing them to operate some kind of driverless service pilot in the state, though two of those companies are only permitted to offer rides with a driver behind the wheel. Only Waymo operates driverless taxis in California. The Google sister company, which took a longer and more cautious approach to self-driving service, spent more than a decade moving from testing early versions of its driverless technology on public roads to running a paid robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona. Today, Waymo operates service in four cities: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin.\nTesla has explored launching a driverless taxi service in at least Palo Alto, Palo Alto Online first reported last year. Emails later obtained by WIRED show that, by late October of last year, Tesla Autopilot head Ashok Elluswamy was negotiating with city council and staff members over how to pull off such a service. Tesla had hoped to launch by taking over the same permit used by another company, Via, that provided shuttle services in California. Eventually, according to the emails, the automaker concluded that it had to apply for its own permit.\nA spokesperson for the City of Palo Alto did not immediately respond to questions about how the new permit might affect robotaxi plans in the area.\nMusk said earlier this year that Tesla plans to launch a driverless taxi service in Austin, Texas, this coming June. (Unlike California, Texas has no strict rules around autonomous vehicle operations.) Last fall, the automaker showed off a prototype of its “Cybercab,” a two-seat, purpose-built robotaxi, which it said it would begin to produce in 2026.\nWhatever happens in Texas this year, Musk and his company have already missed a few deadlines. In 2019, he said the automaker would have 1 million robotaxis on the road by the following year.",

Today, Waymo operates service in four cities: Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Tesla has explored launching a driverless taxi service in at least Palo Alto, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2024/10/22/palo-alto-explores-robotaxi-deal-with-tesla/\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2024/10/22/palo-alto-explores-robotaxi-deal-with-tesla/\" href=\"https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2024/10/22/palo-alto-explores-robotaxi-deal-with-tesla/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Palo Alto Online</a> first reported last year. Emails later obtained by WIRED show that, by late October of last year, Tesla Autopilot head Ashok Elluswamy was negotiating with city council and staff members over how to pull off such a service. Tesla had hoped to launch by taking over the same permit used by another company, Via, that provided shuttle services in California. Eventually, according to the emails, the automaker concluded that it had to apply for its own permit.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A spokesperson for the City of Palo Alto did not immediately respond to questions about how the new permit might affect robotaxi plans in the area.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Musk said earlier this year that Tesla plans to launch a driverless taxi service in Austin, Texas, this coming June. (Unlike California, Texas has no strict rules around autonomous vehicle operations.) Last fall, the automaker showed off a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-cybercab-is-here/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">prototype of its “Cybercab,”</a> a two-seat, purpose-built robotaxi, which it said it would begin to produce in 2026.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Whatever happens in Texas this year, Musk and his company have already missed a few deadlines.

    "content_text": "Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has spent the first six weeks of the new Trump administration turning the federal government upside down. It has moved from agency to agency, accessing sensitive data and payment systems, all on a supposed crusade to audit the government and stop fraud, waste, and abuse. DOGE has posted some of its “findings” on its website, many of which have been revealed to be errors.\nBut two federal auditors with years of experience, who have both worked on financial and technical audits for the government, say that DOGE’s actions are the furthest thing from what an actual audit looks like. Both asked to speak on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t permitted to speak to the press.\n“Honestly, comparing real auditing to what DOGE is doing, there’s no comparison,” says one of the auditors who spoke to WIRED. “None of them are auditors.”\nIn September, in a speech during the presidential campaign, then candidate Donald Trump said that he would create a government efficiency task force, headed by Musk, which would do a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government.” Musk initially said that he wanted to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget, more than the entire 2023 discretionary budget of $1.7 trillion. Musk has since tempered his ambitions, saying he’d aim to cut $1 trillion in government spending. Still, he has alleged that much of this money can be cut by identifying waste, fraud, and abuse, and has continued to claim DOGE’s cuts of agency staff and resources are all part of an audit.\nWhile there are certainly instances of government money siphoned off to fraud—a Government Accountability Office study published in 2024 estimated that the government loses between $233 billion and $521 billion to fraud each year—even recovering all that spending wouldn’t amount to the $1 trillion Musk hopes to cut from the budget.\nThe auditors who spoke to WIRED allege that not only is Musk’s claim not true, but also that DOGE appears to have completely eschewed the existing processes for actually rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.\n“An audit that follows Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), also known as a Yellow Book audit, is conducted in accordance with the standards issued by the US Government Accountability Office,” says the first auditor. Audits can focus on the finances, compliance, or performance of an agency. “That is the gold standard for how you audit the government.”\nThere are generally five phases of a GAGAS audit, the auditors tell WIRED: planning, evidence gathering, evaluation, reporting, and follow up. Auditors work to define the scope of an audit, identify all the applicable laws and standards, and come up with an audit plan. Next, auditors conduct interviews with staff, review financial records, and comb through data, reports, and transactions, documenting all the way. From there, auditors will assess that information against policies or procedures to figure out if there’s been some kind of alleged waste, fraud, or abuse and issue a report detailing their findings and offering recommendations. Often, those reports are made available to the public. After an audit, the auditors can follow up with the agency to ensure changes are being made.\nThere are also very technical definitions for what constitutes waste, fraud, or abuse. Waste could mean that there are inefficiencies in a program that might lead to purchasing more of something that goes unused, or paying more for a service than is necessary. Fraud involves intentional deception—for instance, bribery or falsifying business records. Abuse means doing things that aren’t necessarily illegal, but that are unethical. This could look like nepotism or favoritism in hiring, or spending excessively on travel.\nIn a recent interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, Musk said he believed that the government was “one big pyramid scheme” and alleged that “entitlements fraud” is a “gigantic magnetic force to pull people in from all around the world and keep them here.”\nThe two auditors told WIRED that going through the technological and financial minutiae of even just a single project or part of an agency can take anywhere from six to 18 months.\n“You can’t coherently audit something like the whole Social Security system in a week or two,” says the second auditor. It’s exactly this rush to crack systems open without full understanding, the auditors say, that has led to Elon Musk’s false claims that 150-year-olds were receiving Social Security benefits. “It could be that DOGE didn’t de-dupe the data.”\n“In no uncertain terms is this an audit,” claims the second auditor. “It’s a heist, stealing a vast amount of government data.”\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Vittoria89.82.\nFederal workers who have spoken to WIRED say they are worried that their own data could be used to surveil and target them for firings based on their identities or political views. There are also concerns that DOGE could access contracts and procurement data that contain sensitive information that companies provide in order to work with the federal government. DOGE has also deployed an AI chatbot within the General Services Administration (GSA) and appears to want to expand the use of such tools, bolstered by access to government data. New court documents also indicate that Marko Elez, the former DOGE representative at the Treasury Department, shared a spreadsheet with personally identifying information outside the agency.\nAnd without time spent for auditors to understand a new data system—like interviewing agency staff or learning the coding language—the first auditor believes it’s likely the DOGE team is flying blind. “When they collect a dataset, they don't get it with any sort of description, I imagine,” they say. “There are no terms of use for any government systems … There's no supporting testimony from data system owners, from data system experts. They don't even know the language and the database systems that they're working in. That’s why they keep messing up.”\nThe auditors described a lengthy vetting process that allowed them to get the permissions necessary to dive into an agency’s data and systems. In addition to going through the initial vetting process, the auditors say that they are required to engage in continuing education.\n“None of them have any auditing background, none have any certifications, none have any clearances,” says the first auditor.\nFederal workers who have spoken to WIRED expressed concern that DOGE’s operatives appear to have bypassed the normal security clearance protocols in order to access sensitive systems. WIRED found that many of DOGE’s youngest members, all of whom were 25 or younger, have very limited work experience, and none in the government. One, Edward Coristine, who goes by “Big Balls” online, appears to be a 19-year-old high school graduate. Despite this, they were given high-level access at places like the GSA, the Social Security Administration, and the Treasury. Others, like those at the Federal Aviation Administration, come directly from Musk’s own companies and were not fully vetted before their start dates.\nThe auditors also noted that even canceling contracts, as DOGE has done, can add to costs, rather than reduce them, in the long run. For instance, often the government negotiates deals on large purchases where it gets discounts for bulk purchases. Canceling a contract likely not only means the government needs to pay some kind of fee to compensate for the contract cancellation—maybe 10 to 15 percent of the contract amount—but if some or part of that purchase needs to be reinstated later, that initial bulk discount will likely be gone, making it more expensive overall. This was the case with many of the software licenses that DOGE said it wanted to cut.\nSince sweeping through the government, DOGE has canceled thousands of government contracts, including 10,000 specifically for humanitarian aid. According to reporting from the Associated Press, 40 percent of those canceled contracts through late February will likely not save the government any money.\n“They'll end up costing more in some way, whether it's time, inconvenience, or money,” says the second auditor.\nBut the auditors say that there are ways DOGE could get it right. “If DOGE wanted to be the good guys, they could,” says the first auditor. “I’d start by looking at existing Inspector General recommendations.” On the website for the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, for instance, there are more than 1,200 recommendations that have yet to be implemented that could potentially save the government hundreds of millions of dollars.\nIn an interview on FOX Business with Larry Kudlow, when asked about how his team was identifying what to go after in the government, Musk replied, “We look at the president's executive orders, and we also just follow the money.”\nThe auditors say they aren’t necessarily against bringing in people from outside the government to help streamline government processes—something that the government was already doing before Trump was sworn in for his second term. For instance, 18F, the digital services agency within the GSA’s Technology Transformation Services, was explicitly designed to serve as an in-house consultancy that would allow federal agencies to leverage private sector expertise. As part of DOGE’s sweep of the government, however, it has gutted the group, putting a pause on several ongoing projects to make government services more efficient for users.\nAnd it’s these actions, the second auditor says, that best show that DOGE’s intentions may not be geared toward “efficiency” at all. “It’s a con,” they allege.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "content_text": "A nationwide egg shortage has sent prices soaring at your local grocery store—and the culprit is H5N1 bird flu. The virus has infected poultry flocks in every US state, with more than 166 million chickens having been killed by the virus or culled to contain it. H5N1 is also spreading among cattle, with close to 1,000 US dairy herds affected, and is suspected to be widespread among wild birds.\nBut these aren’t the only animals at risk. Domestic cats are particularly susceptible to catching the virus, which can be fatal in felines, while the rising trend of keeping backyard chickens—partly in response to the egg shortage—risks driving up cases further. Pets and backyard flocks can catch the virus from infected birds, alive or dead, as well as from droppings, contaminated surfaces, and contaminated food.\nThe reported number of US pets impacted by bird flu is relatively low, but cases of H5N1 in domestic cats are rising across the country. As of March 12, there have been 115 cases recorded in pet cats, across 20 states, according to the US Department of Agriculture. However, many cases in pets are probably being missed. “We are likely seeing an undercount of cases of H5 bird flu in pets, as not all sick pets with a possible epidemiologic link or exposure are reported to Veterinary Public Health,” says Jamie Middleton, director of veterinary public health and chief veterinarian at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. “As a result, not all cases are tested.”\nCost of testing is an additional barrier to getting an accurate picture of how widespread pet infections are. “Commercial PCR lab testing for influenza at veterinary clinics is very costly, approximately $200 to $300 for a respiratory PCR panel for dogs and cats,” Middleton says. “Thus, many pet owners may elect to not test if their pet is experiencing respiratory symptoms.”\nBird flu can also be missed during testing if an infected animal isn’t shedding the virus at the time they were tested, making it difficult to pinpoint just how widespread the virus is among pets.\nThe Risks to Your Cat\n“We have known for years that cats are susceptible to influenza, and it’s on top of many people’s minds now because they can die from it,” says Sandra Faeh, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). Cats, specifically those that go outside, are particularly at risk because of their exposure to potentially sick birds.\nCats are also becoming infected by being fed raw food—either homemade or commercially available—as well as unpasteurized milk. Two cats in Oregon recently died of avian influenza after having been fed raw food produced by the company Northwest Naturals. These deaths prompted a voluntary recall of raw pet food by the company.\nNorthwest Naturals did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\nFaeh says that the best thing to do to protect your cat is to keep them inside and away from wildlife. Middleton of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health also advises people to avoid “feeding raw or undercooked meat and poultry products, raw milk or raw dairy products, and raw pet food diets to their pets.”\nFor cats who enjoy spending time outside, Feah says that leashed walks are a good option. She also encourages cat owners to consider constructing secure catios or enclosed and covered outdoor areas, to allow the animals to still get fresh air and the sensory stimulation of being outside, but without the risk of contact with wildlife and their droppings.\nAs there are concerns that bird flu could also be passed to dogs, Faeh recommends keeping dogs on a leash when outside as well. The AVMA also advises against feeding raw and undercooked food or treats to dogs.\nFaeh says that cat owners should seek out veterinary attention if they have any concerns about their pet’s health. Symptoms of bird flu to watch for include loss of appetite, lethargy, fever, runny nose, runny eyes, and tremors. If you have a sick pet and are making a veterinary appointment, be sure to notify the clinic when scheduling that you are concerned about bird flu. Your veterinary team may ask you and your pet to wait outside until your appointment time, and may take additional precautions in-clinic to prevent possible spread of the disease.\nHow to Protect Pet Chickens\nKeeping backyard chickens has become a popular hobby, including in large cities across the United States, and with the rising price of eggs it’s likely that more and more Americans are going to start keeping flocks. If they spend time outside, backyard flocks are at high risk of catching bird flu right now.\nFor those considering becoming chicken owners, Faeh recommends first contacting the local health and agriculture departments to discuss the risks of bird flu in the local area, prior to bringing any chickens home. If the risk of infection is high where you live—for instance if there have been reported outbreaks in flocks nearby—consider delaying becoming an owner.\nIf you’re still set on getting chickens, or if you already have a backyard flock, there are precautions you can take, Faeh says. Chickens should not be permitted to roam free in your yard, she says; instead, keep them in a covered coop or run to prevent exposure to wildlife. Faeh also encourages owners to limit their chickens’ exposure to guests, who could unintentionally introduce the disease to the flock.\nSymptoms of H5N1 in backyard chickens can be more difficult to spot than in cats, as the birds can quickly die from the disease. It’s important to have established care with a local veterinarian who practices with chickens, Faeh says. If you notice any illness within your flock, contact your veterinarian right away. Likewise, if one of your chickens passes and you suspect bird flu, call your veterinarian and your local public health department.\nOwners should also take their own precautions when working with, caring for, and handling backyard chickens. Wash your hands and change your clothes after engaging with your birds, even if they seem in good health, Faeh says. If you have a pet or bird that appears sick, consider masking up, she adds.\nAlthough the spread of H5N1 from livestock to humans is rare, the virus has shown that it’s able to make this jump. Seventy people in the US have been infected since the beginning of the outbreak, and one person has died. Most human cases, however, have been reported in farm laborers working with infected livestock, with most of the transmission appearing to happen within the dairy industry, where people are encountering infected cattle and unpasteurized milk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to human health from H5N1 is low.\nBut of course, the point of good hygiene is to try to stop the virus moving in either direction. If you handle sick chickens, you may not catch the virus, but you could pass it on. Washing your hands and changing clothes after spending time with your birds isn’t just for your benefit, but for the protection of other animals you might come into contact with—perhaps your pets, or those of people you know. “The risks are much lower to people than cats,” says Faeh. “We are more likely to bring it to them than they are to bring it to us.”\nUpdated 3-19-2025 11:50 am GMT: A typo in the name of the American Veterinary Medical Association was corrected.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nNearly a decade after its demise, smartwatch maker Pebble is back—sort of. Today, the company's founder, Eric Migicovsky, has unveiled new hardware running open source PebbleOS. However, since Google owns the Pebble trademark, these are not Pebble smartwatches. Instead, say hello to the first watches from a new brand called Core Devices: Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2.\nFor a brief history lesson, Pebble skyrocketed to fame in 2012 through a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign. The company's smartwatches had e-paper displays and arrived ahead of the first Apple Watch, offering wearers the ability to see notifications, create custom watch faces, and even access an app store—all with battery life that lasted a week despite an always-on screen.\nBut the company scaled too quickly and then didn't meet its sales targets, eventually deciding to sell to Fitbit. A few years later, Google bought Fitbit, which meant it owned Pebble's assets.\nThe original Pebble smartwatches didn't die off—Fitbit kept the lights on for some time, and thanks to Pebble's cult-like fanbase, a coalition of developers and enthusiasts helped launch the Rebble project to replace Pebble's web services when Fitbit eventually shut everything down, so that core functions of the watches kept working.\nBut what's enabled Migicovsky to introduce new hardware running PebbleOS is Google's decision to release the source code in January. “I asked politely if they would open source the operating system, and they very graciously did,” Migicovsky tells WIRED. “We wouldn't be able to do what we're doing now if Google hadn't done that, so we're super appreciative.”\nNew Leaf\nThat brings us to Migicovsky's new brand—Core Devices—a nod to the Pebble Core, the screen-less wearable that never shipped. This is a very small operation that consists of Migicovsky, another full-time employee, and a few contractors—he says he's taking things a bit more cautiously this time around. That's why there will only be roughly 10,000 units available for the Core 2 Duo and a little more of the Core Time 2—preorders are live today if you want to reserve one.\n“I’m intentionally trying to build something that’s sustainable, rather than a fast-growing do-or-die company,\" Migicovsky says. \"We’re taking small risks, we're doing a couple of products, one at a time—and cautiously, carefully building this company to be sustainable. If we can do our jobs, build these watches and make people happy, we'll build more. There's always more time.\"\nThe first to arrive this July is the Core 2 Duo, which shares many characteristics with the Pebble 2 from 2016. This $149 wearable has a 1.26-inch monochrome e-paper display embedded into a polycarbonate frame that comes in black or white. Like the original, it has a microphone, is IPX8 water resistant, and features step and sleep tracking.\nSo what's new? Battery life has been beefed up significantly from 7 days to 30. There's a newer Bluetooth chip inside, a barometer and compass, a quieter and stronger motor for better vibration alerts, and more reliable buttons (the old buttons had a history of degrading over time). Migicovsky says the new pushers should offer up to a 30 percent longer lifetime in testing.\n|Core 2 Duo\n|Core Time 2\n|Display: 1.26-inch black and white e-paper screen, 144 X 168 pixels\n|1.5-inch 64-color e-paper screen, 200 X 228 pixels\n|Buttons: 4 buttons\n|4 buttons and touchscreen\n|Frame and strap width: Polycarbonate, 22 mm\n|Aluminum, 22 mm\n|Sensors: 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU), compass, barometer\n|6-axis IMU, heart rate sensor\n|Battery life: 30 days\n|30 days\n|Extras: IPX8, microphone and speaker, vibrator, backlight\n|IPX8, microphone and speaker, vibrator, backlight\n|Price: $149\n|$225\nNext is the Core Time 2, which resembles the Pebble Time 2 that never shipped. It has a few enhancements over the Duo, such as a larger 1.5-inch 64-color e-paper screen, an aluminum frame and buttons, and a heart-rate monitor. It also has a touchscreen. While the operating system is not built for touch interactions, this capability will initially let you hop into apps by tapping on a “complication” on the watch's face. Over time, the touchscreen interactions will expand. These upgrades mean a higher $225 price, and it won't ship until December.\nClassic Pebble\nLike the Pebbles of old, Core's smartwatches buzz when notifications arrive, have customizable watch faces, show the time on an always-on display, can control music playback via physical buttons, and offer rudimentary health tracking. They can access more than 10,000 PebbleOS apps and watch faces published through the Rebble Foundation.\nSome apps may try to access web services that aren't available, and watch faces for the Core Time 2 will have a border until developers update them to take advantage of the larger display. Migicovsky says there will be a companion app for Android and iOS, and an updated software development kit for developers who want to create new apps.\nOne new app Migicovsky is toying with is a ChatGPT app that lets you push one of the buttons to activate the AI assistant. The new built-in speaker will let you hear answers without having to pull out your connected smartphone, which powers the whole experience.\nEven with capabilities like this, these watches are not designed to have all the features you might find on an Apple Watch. “This is not for everyone,\" Migicovsky says. \"Most people like the Apple Watch. Most people are happy with the Apple Watch. This is for the people who aren't. This is for the people who don't feel like they're well served by the status quo.”\nFurthering this view that the Cores are not for everyone, in Migicovsky's blog post announcing the two watches, there's a section that nudges people to avoid Core's latest if they want a fitness watch, a full-featured smartwatch, or even a device that is super polished. Migicovsky says some features may not be ready at launch, there could be delays, and the whole project could also not last as long as expected.\n“We're not predicating our entire lives on the success of this,” Migicovsky says. \"We'll move on and build other products if people don't want these.\" Perhaps this more measured approach will mean Migicovsky's latest won't befall the same fate as Pebble, or perhaps not—early-adopting consumers will again have to run the risk of buying in to a product that could die before its time.\nMigicovsky is at least trying to mitigate this risk, though, as you can preorder the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 now to secure your unit—but if you get cold feet and change your mind, you can get a full refund if you cancel before your watch ships.",

    "content_text": "Before she started writing video games, Emma Kidwell loved Twilight fan fiction. Her “bad, self-insert” stories found a home on DeviantArt, an online community where people posted fan art, original work, and so much more. “The low barrier of entry made it very accessible,” Kidwell says.\nHer writing turned into role-playing in forums, and Twilight fandom gave way to a love of video games like Mass Effect. Today, Kidwell is a writer for Firaxis Games and a rising star in the world of game narrative. Her work includes Hindsight, Borderlands 4, Life Is Strange 2, and Sid Meier’s Civilization VII; she has been featured in Forbes 30 Under 30 and the Game Awards’ Future Class of 2023.\nThis week, she’s hosting the annual Independent Games Festival awards during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. All of that is happening alongside her talk about how writing in fandoms as a kid helped her write DLC for Marvel's Midnight Suns.\nWriting fan fiction, it turns out, isn’t so different from writing licensed characters. “I’m role-playing when I'm writing Marvel IP for Firaxis,” Kidwell says. “Fan fiction gave me that foundation to build off of.”\nFan fiction has often been considered a lower form of writing, as either self indulgent or outrageously erotic, the sort of work one does in secret. In the internet culture pantheon, few fanfic writers have ever achieved fame, and those that have sometimes do so for the salacious nature of their work. “My Immortal,” an infamous Harry Potter fanfic, is still referenced in interviews today. Writers such as E.L. James, who created the Fifty Shades series (originally a Twilight fanfic), however, have begun to turn their work into something profitable.\nOthers, like Kidwell, have turned it into a runway for their careers. “I think because of fan fiction’s relationship to marginalized communities, it wasn't initially seen as being a valid form of writing,” Kidwell says. Clearly, that’s wrong. The gaming and fanfic communities make for a harmonious marriage. The story-driven nature of most games means plenty of fodder for fans craving new narratives, but writers on well-known sites like Archive of Our Own can—and will—turn anything into an original story. Even Tetris.\n“Fan fiction is your sandbox,” Kidwell says. “You get to play. There are no rules. You get comfortable playing around with characters that aren't yours and doing whatever the hell you want with them.”\nFor Midnight Suns, Kidwell was given four characters to choose from, including Deadpool and Storm. Whatever she wrote would be based on the comic versions of the characters, not their cinematic counterparts. While researching both characters, she had a revelation: “This is really similar to what I would think about when creating an original character in a role-playing setting. How would this character fit in with other established characters?”\nWriters in Kidwell’s position still have to stick to the rules of the franchise, including its story canon. That hasn’t kept Kidwell from being able to tell the stories she wants. “I think a big, common misconception with IP writing is that it's super restrictive,” Kidwell says. “But I think there's a lot of creative freedom within certain boundaries because you get to inject a little piece of yourself into these characters. It's just kind of like a puzzle: figure out how you can do it authentically and how you can do it in a way that makes sense for the game.”\nKidwell still role-plays in her spare time.

Her “bad, self-insert” stories found a home on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2013/03/deviantart-dreamup/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DeviantArt</a>, an online community where people posted fan art, original work, and so much more. “The low barrier of entry made it very accessible,” Kidwell says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Her writing turned into role-playing in forums, and <em>Twilight</em> fandom gave way to a love of video games like <em>Mass Effect</em>. Today, Kidwell is a writer for Firaxis Games and a rising star in the world of game narrative. Her work includes <em>Hindsight</em>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Life Is Strange 2</em>, and <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII</em>; she has been featured in <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2021/games/?profile=emma-kidwell\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2021/games/?profile=emma-kidwell\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2021/games/?profile=emma-kidwell\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes 30 Under 30</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-game-awards-israel-palestine-open-letter-future-class/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Game Awards’ Future Class</a> of 2023.</p><p class=\"paywall\">This week, she’s hosting the annual Independent Games Festival awards during the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/canadian-devs-are-backing-out-of-gdc/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Game Developers Conference</a> in San Francisco. All of that is happening alongside her talk about how writing in fandoms as a kid helped her write DLC for <em>Marvel's Midnight Suns</em>.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Writing fan fiction, it turns out, isn’t so different from writing licensed characters. “I’m role-playing when I'm writing Marvel IP for Firaxis,” Kidwell says. “Fan fiction gave me that foundation to build off of.”</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\"><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/fanfiction-omegaverse-sex-trope-artificial-intelligence-knotting/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fan fiction</a> has often been considered a lower form of writing, as either self indulgent or outrageously erotic, the sort of work one does in secret. In the internet culture pantheon, few fanfic writers have ever achieved fame, and those that have sometimes do so for the salacious nature of their work. “My Immortal,” an infamous Harry Potter fanfic, is still <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21328232/amy-lee-evanescence-my-immortal-fanfic-bitter-truth-music-video-interview\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://www.theverge.com/21328232/amy-lee-evanescence-my-immortal-fanfic-bitter-truth-music-video-interview\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21328232/amy-lee-evanescence-my-immortal-fanfic-bitter-truth-music-video-interview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">referenced in interviews</a> today. Writers such as E.L. James, who created the <em>Fifty Shades</em> series (originally a <em>Twilight</em> fanfic), however, have begun to turn their work into something profitable.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Others, like Kidwell, have turned it into a runway for their careers. “I think because of fan fiction’s relationship to marginalized communities, it wasn't initially seen as being a valid form of writing,” Kidwell says. Clearly, that’s wrong. The gaming and fanfic communities make for a harmonious marriage. The story-driven nature of most games means plenty of fodder for fans craving new narratives, but writers on well-known sites like Archive of Our Own can—and will—turn anything into an original story. <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tetris%20(Video%20Games)/works\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tetris%20(Video%20Games)/works\" href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Tetris%20(Video%20Games)/works\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Even Tetris</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“Fan fiction is your sandbox,” Kidwell says. “You get to play. There are no rules. You get comfortable playing around with characters that aren't yours and doing whatever the hell you want with them.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">For <em>Midnight Suns</em>, Kidwell was given four characters to choose from, including Deadpool and Storm. Whatever she wrote would be based on the comic versions of the characters, not their cinematic counterparts. While researching both characters, she had a revelation: “This is really similar to what I would think about when creating an original character in a role-playing setting. How would this character fit in with other established characters?”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Writers in Kidwell’s position still have to stick to the rules of the franchise, including its story canon. That hasn’t kept Kidwell from being able to tell the stories she wants. “I think a big, common misconception with IP writing is that it's super restrictive,” Kidwell says. “But I think there's a lot of creative freedom within certain boundaries because you get to inject a little piece of yourself into these characters. It's just kind of like a puzzle: figure out how you can do it authentically and how you can do it in a way that makes sense for the game.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Kidwell still role-plays in her spare time. Right now, she’s deep into the <em>Dragon Age</em> community. “I see IP writing as kind of the in-between,” she says of fan fiction and fiction. It’s a natural next step in role-playing: “I'm just doing it in a professional setting now.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "We’re living in chaotic times. The stock market is unpredictable, and the political landscape resembles a minefield. For anyone who is seeking a little more sanity, there is a way to stay more organized even when your brain is scattered—at least when it comes to Google Chrome.\nThe browser’s bookmarks system, which has been a key part of Chrome ever since the browser launched in 2008, is an easily overlooked feature. But if you’re not using it, you should learn how it works, because it’s a godsend.\nChrome’s bookmarks system is modeled after the folder structure on your computer. You can build folders to organize your bookmarked web pages, filter how the lists or folders are displayed, and drag and drop them to different places.\nTo access the All Bookmarks side panel, click All Bookmarks on the far upper right side of the Chrome browser, then select the first option: Open Side Panel to see All Bookmarks. You can then create folders (and subfolders) for your favorite sites, your Google Docs, bookmarks for research, web apps you use frequently, banking sites, or just about anything.\nWhy bother? While it might be tempting to drag and drop a website URL onto the bookmarks bar with reckless abandon, that thin strip of links gets crowded quickly. It’s also not searchable or easy to organize. The All Bookmarks side panel helps you find saved websites much more quickly while also keeping everything tidier. Even long-time Chrome users will find some benefits to using the sidebar. It might take a little work up front, as we’ll see, but the payoff is worth it.\nGet Started With the All Bookmarks Side Panel\nMost of us probably already have dozens of bookmarks saved, if not hundreds. The good news is you can start using the All Bookmarks side panel at any time.\nIt’s best to start by creating the main folders first. Open the side panel and click the New Folder option. Name the folder something that helps you stay organized, such as “Research” or “Banking Sites.” My folders are quite granular; I have folders for TikTok users I like, new browser-based apps, movies and TV shows to investigate, and products I am thinking about buying. Each of these folders holds all my bookmarks related to that topic, making them easier to find. You can also create subfolders. In my Research folder, for example, I have subfolders for “New Science,” “Video Games,” and “Books.” You can even create subfolders within subfolders, but that’s the max.\nIn the All Bookmarks side panel, you can view the folders alphabetically, from newest to oldest (or vice versa), or by last opened. Just click the little down-pointing sorting arrow on the top of the side panel. There’s also a toggle for Compact view (which is more condensed) or Visual view (which shows larger thumbnails for each folder and bookmark).\nThere’s a tiny pencil icon that, once clicked, lets you perform some powerful features. You can delete folders and bookmarks and move them to other folders, but it also lets you open every bookmark in a folder at once.\nExperiment with your folder structure until everything is organized to meet your needs. Note that there’s also a search box to find saved bookmarks.\nUsing Your New Folders\nSince you likely already have bookmarks, now’s the time to put them into the folders you just created. There are quite a few ways to do this, but my preferred method is to just drag-and-drop each bookmark over to a folder. (You can also right-click any bookmark and use the Add Folder option and pick your folder, but that takes more time.)\nAfter you organize all of your current bookmarks into folders, you can then start saving bookmarks into folders as you discover new sites. Leave the All Bookmarks side panel open so you can just drag-and-drop the web URL over to a folder. You can also click the star to the right of the URL in Chrome’s URL field, which opens up a dialog box where you can select a folder for that bookmark.\nThe All Bookmarks side panel even has an Add current tab option at the bottom of the panel.\nAdvanced Features to Try\nWhile these basic functions can help you keep your bookmarks organized, there are also a few advanced features that might save you time.\nOne is related to products you want to save or purchase later. When you’re surfing around an ecommerce site (Amazon, Newegg) Google Chrome recognizes that you’re looking at a product page; when it does, you’ll see a tiny bell appear to the right of the URL. Click the bell to “track” that product. When you click the bell, Chrome creates a bookmark folder called “Shopping list” (if it hasn’t created it already) and adds the product page to that folder.\nYou’ll find all of your saved shopping products in the Shopping list folder. It also generates a fast way to access your saved products by putting a “Tracked products” shortcut at the top of the panel. Clicking that will bring you to the Shopping list folder. If you want to get email notifications when the price of a tracked product drops, Google provides instructions for that too.\nHere’s a much faster way to access the side panel itself too. Once you open the panel, look for the tiny pin icon at the top. That will make the All Bookmarks icon show up in Chrome’s top-right corner, next to your user profile image; it looks like two overlapping stars. Now, when you want to open the side panel, just click the stars icon.\nThe All Bookmarks side panel can really change how you browse. It makes you more productive, because you can save and organize everything you find. And of course, there’s that search bar right at the top of the sidebar that suggests results as you type. No more hunting around trying to find bookmarks, which is a huge pain.",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIf airports weren’t already a hellscape, TikTok has found a way to make them worse. Welcome to airport theory, a viral delusion that suggests you can roll up to the airport 15 minutes before boarding, waltz through security, and still make your flight with time to spare. No stress, no waiting, just pure main character energy.\nTikTok creators like Michael DiCostanzo (@michael.dicostanzo) swear by it, documenting their dashes through high-traffic hubs like LAX, Atlanta International Airport, and post–Super Bowl New Orleans. Some viewers are sold. Others are calling BS.\n“So you had PreCheck, didn’t check a bag, and were at the nearest terminal? Now let’s do it when it’s not the optimal situation,” one user commented. And, sure enough, the internet is also littered with failed attempts—videos of forlorn TikTokers watching their flights take off without them, their carry-ons full of regret.\nIt’s a fun fantasy, which explains why “airport theory” has racked up over 400 million views on TikTok. Unfortunately, the Transportation Security Administration doesn’t care about your viral moment. The national average wait time for security was 27 minutes, 16 seconds in 2024. And if you’re flying out of a notorious bottleneck like JFK, Orlando International, or Chicago O’Hare, it’s closer to 40 minutes. Google searches for “I missed my flight what do I do” have spiked 70 percent in the past month, per Google Trends. It’s not hard to connect the dots.\nHere is your sad reality check: Airlines still recommend arriving at least two hours before a domestic flight, three for international. Sometimes that buffer feels like overkill. But would you rather rush through the airport with your heart racing or have a few minutes to make sure your gate exists, grab a bag of overpriced whatever, and scroll TikTok watching other people miss their flights? That sounds like a much better airport theory to us.\nAirport Hacks That Actually Work\nThe best way to get through airport security unscathed is to move like you’ve done this a hundred times before. A little planning, the right gear, and skipping social media stunts will get you from curb to gate with minimal stress.\n- Travel off-peak. According to CheapAir, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often less crowded. Early flights between 5 and 8 am and red-eyes (after 9 pm) tend to have fewer passengers.\n- Check TSA wait times in advance. The My TSA app (iOS, Android) provides real-time security line updates at major airports.\n- Download your airline’s app for mobile boarding passes and real-time gate updates.\n- Get TSA PreCheck. Some credit cards even cover the fee. Global Entry (available at select airports) includes PreCheck and fast-tracks reentry into the U.S. Or consider Clear Plus, which uses biometric scans to bypass ID checks.\n- Use the Mobile Passport Control app (iOS, Android) to submit your customs info beforehand for faster reentry to the US.\n- Start with an empty bag. Double-check the TSA-restricted items list to avoid accidentally smuggling contraband.\n- Use a clear toiletry bag. The Calpak Clear Cosmetics Case for $85 is an upgrade from the ziplock bag. If you’re worried about TSA’s liquid restrictions, switch to toothpaste tablets like biöm’s Nobs and use reusable travel bottles. I'm a fan of Ries’ Refillable Travel Container set, but I've also used travel kits from Amazon for under $10, and they work just as well.\n- Go carry-on only. The Away Carry-On for $275 is our favorite, but if you want to avoid Away’s baggage, try Monos ($255) or July ($295).\n- Track your luggage. If you check a bag, stash an AirTag inside for iPhone users or a Chipolo One Point ($25) or Card Spot ($29) for Android.\n- Empty your pockets before security. Stash everything in your carry-on instead of fumbling at the checkpoint.\n- Keep metal jewelry, watches, and belts in your bag until after screening.\n- Avoid boots or high-tops. Slip-ons like Allbirds' Tree Runners for $98 and the Rothy’s Driving Loafer for $189—we've raved about them in the past—make security a breeze. If you’re not planning on sprinting through the airport, the Bearpaw Martis Slippers ($70) are ultra-comfy.\n- Skip bulky outerwear. Coats, hoodies with big pockets, and anything with excessive zippers just slows you down. If you have PreCheck, you can usually keep your shoes, belt, and light jacket on.\n- If you have an iPhone, invest in a MagSafe wallet to avoid digging through your bag for an ID. Some of our favorites include Casetify ($38), Moft’s Snap-On Phone Stand & Wallet ($30), and ESR HaloLock Power Bank Wallet ($80), which works as a power bank, wallet, and phone stand.\n- Get a TSA-friendly laptop backpack. Lay-flat designs like Peak Design’s Outdoor Backpack (available in 25L and 45L) speed up screenings.",

    "content_text": "An invitation to a “candlelight” dinner held this past Saturday at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club asked prospective guests to spend $1 million per seat. Trump attended the dinner along with Elon Musk, according to multiple photographs and videos of the event viewed by WIRED.\nElon Musk, wearing his standard uniform of a black sport coat over a black T-shirt, was seen shaking hands and waving to other attendees. He was with a woman wearing a floor length gown who appeared to be Shivon Zilis, according to Instagram Reels posted by multiple guests. Zilis, a Neuralink executive who previously sat on the board of OpenAI, is the mother of four of Musk’s 14 known children. (Zilis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\nMusk, whose so-called Department of Government Efficiency has spent the last six weeks ransacking federal agencies, sat next to Trump at the dinner.\nWIRED previously reported on another candlelight dinner held on March 1 where guests were also invited to spend $1 million per person. That event appeared on the president’s public schedule with a note reading “the President attends the MAGA INC. Candlelight Finance Dinner.” The March 15 candlelight dinner did not appear on the official schedule.\n“You are invited to a candlelight dinner featuring special guest speaker President Donald J. Trump,” states the invitation, obtained by WIRED. “$1,000,000 per person.” The invitation has a “MAGA INC.” header and a note at the bottom of the invitation reads, “Donald J. Trump is appearing at this event only as a special guest speaker and is not asking for funds or donations.” MAGA Inc., or Make America Great Again Inc., is a super PAC that supported Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.\nWIRED has also reported that business leaders could secure a one-on-one meeting with Trump for $5 million at Mar-a-Lago. The $5 million meetings have become a “hot ticket” in the business community, a source familiar with them previously told WIRED.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the event or the lack of the event’s inclusion on the president’s official schedule.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Do you know anything about these dinners and meetings? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporters securely on Signal at leahfeiger.86 and zoeschiffer.87.\nExperts WIRED has spoken with about these candlelight dinners have noted concerns about their unusual nature. “I can’t recall a sitting president in the first weeks of his administration asking for millions of dollars in fundraising,” Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, previously told WIRED. “The concern is less about fundraising and more about access and influence. People hoping to get favorable treatment view it in their interest to donate money to Trump.”\nThe candlelight dinner occurred over the same weekend as the Palm Event, an annual celebration of motorsports in Palm Beach, Florida. One of the celebration’s weekend events occurred at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday afternoon and featured “street sportscars and cars with a motorsports heritage, one-of-a-kind, concept cars, celebrity-owned and cars with a racing history,” according to the Palm Event website. A number of these cars appeared the night prior at the candlelight dinner, according to Instagram reels that featured guests milling around a Rolls Royce, Bugatti, and Lamborghini, among other luxury vehicles displayed on the lawn.\nThe evening also coincided with a serious escalation in Trump’s crackdown on immigration. On Saturday, while Trump and Musk dined with MAGA donors, a federal judge ordered the White House to stop the deportation of people the Trump administration alleged were Venezuelan gang members. Despite that ruling, two planes carrying the alleged gang members flew from Texas to El Salvador. Senior officials reportedly told Axios that the ruling held no force “because the flights were over international waters.”",

Senior officials reportedly <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/03/16/trump-white-house-defy-judge-deport-venezuelans\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told Axios</a> that the ruling held no force “because the flights were over international waters.”</p></div></div></body></html>",

    "content_text": "Since Amazon announced plans for a generative AI version of Alexa, we were concerned about user privacy. With Alexa+ rolling out to Amazon Echo devices in the coming weeks, we’re getting a clearer view of the privacy concessions people will have to make to maximize usage of the AI voice assistant and avoid bricking functionality of already-purchased devices.\nIn an email sent to customers today, Amazon said that Echo users will no longer be able to set their devices to process Alexa requests locally and, therefore, avoid sending voice recordings to Amazon’s cloud. Amazon apparently sent the email to users with “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” enabled on their Echo. Starting on March 28, recordings of every command spoken to the Alexa living in Echo speakers and smart displays will automatically be sent to Amazon and processed in the cloud.\nAttempting to rationalize the change, Amazon’s email said: “As we continue to expand Alexa’s capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon’s secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature.”\nOne of the most marketed features of Alexa+ is its more advanced ability to recognize who is speaking to it, a feature known as Alexa Voice ID. To accommodate this feature, Amazon is eliminating a privacy-focused capability for all Echo users, even those who aren’t interested in the subscription-based version of Alexa or want to use Alexa+ but not its ability to recognize different voices.\nHowever, there are plenty of reasons people wouldn't want Amazon to receive recordings of what they say to their personal device. For one, the idea of a conglomerate being able to listen to personal requests made in your home is, simply, unnerving.\nFurther, Amazon has previously mismanaged Alexa voice recordings. In 2023, Amazon agreed to pay $25 million in civil penalties over the revelation that it stored recordings of children’s interactions with Alexa forever. Adults also didn’t feel properly informed of Amazon’s inclination to keep Alexa recordings unless prompted not to until 2019—five years after the first Echo came out.\nIf that's not enough to deter you from sharing voice recordings with Amazon, note that the company allowed employees to listen to Alexa voice recordings. In 2019, Bloomberg reported that Amazon employees listened to as many as 1,000 audio samples during their nine-hour shifts. Amazon says it allows employees to listen to Alexa voice recordings to train its speech recognition and natural language understanding systems.\nOther reasons people may be hesitant to trust Amazon with personal voice samples include the previous usage of Alexa voice recordings in criminal trials and Amazon paying a settlement in 2023 in relation to allegations that it allowed “thousands of employees and contractors to watch video recordings of customers' private spaces” taken from Ring cameras, per the Federal Trade Commission.\nSave Recordings or Lose Functionality\nLikely looking to get ahead of these concerns, Amazon said in its email today that, by default, it will delete recordings of users’ Alexa requests after processing. However, anyone with their Echo device set to “Don’t save recordings” will see their already-purchased devices’ Voice ID feature bricked. Voice ID enables Alexa to do things like share user-specified calendar events, reminders, music, and more. Previously, Amazon has said that \"if you choose not to save any voice recordings, Voice ID may not work.\" As of March 28, broken Voice ID is a guarantee for people who don't let Amazon store their voice recordings.\nAmazon's email says:\nAmazon is forcing Echo users to make a couple of tough decisions: Grant Amazon access to recordings of everything you say to Alexa or stop using an Echo; let Amazon save voice recordings and have employees listen to them or lose a feature set to become more advanced and central to the next generation of Alexa.\nHowever, Amazon is betting big that Alexa+ can dig the voice assistant out of a financial pit. Amazon has publicly committed to keeping the free version of Alexa around, but Alexa+ is viewed as Amazon's last hope for keeping Alexa alive and making it profitable. Anything Amazon can do to get people to pay for Alexa takes precedence over other Alexa user demands, including, it seems, privacy.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

That means getting some of your favorite music in analog format.\nWhile we always recommend you hit up a local independent record store when shopping for your next album, sometimes you want something very specific or hard to find, or you’re looking for vinyl records to send to friends or family. Here are the best ways to find those records online.\nDon't forget to check out the rest of our buying guides, including the Best Turntables and Best Bookshelf Speakers, and information on How to Set Up a Turntable.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nDiscogs\nThe center of vinyl collections the internet over, Discogs allows folks to buy, sell, and trade rare and desirable discs from their collections. This is the best place to find the coolest (and most expensive) albums and singles ever pressed to plastic.\nThe store here sells all formats of music, from vinyl to cassettes and CDs, so you'll need to select the vinyl category before searching for whatever you are after. With over 11.5 million records in the United States alone, you're unlikely to run out of things you want before you run out of cash. Make an account, register your collection, and start searching for new gems to fill it out.\nBandcamp\nI love searching Bandcamp for new musical gems to order for friends and family. If you're looking for truly independent music from all over the globe, select the Vinyl tab at the top of the homepage and get to listening. You may have to do a bit of digital crate digging to find something that you like, but that's the best part of visiting record stores in person anyway. Shop till your eyes drop.\nYou can digitally search for tags, genres, and locations at the top, and I recommend you do so if you're looking for something specific. It can be helpful if you are trying to buy something from your home town, for example.\nEbay\nAs with anything collectible, you can find good deals (and occasional ripoffs) on Ebay. This is a good place to buy very rare and expensive stuff or, on the flip side, lots of super-cheap records that you're willing to gamble on. I've had good results finding jazz records and albums from other lesser-loved genres here, but if you're looking for something super specific, Discogs is better for tracking the market and finding good prices.\nVinyl Me, Please\nVinyl Me, Please is a record-of-the-month club that lets you also purchase one-off records. I like this service because it presses rare one-offs of classics as well as modern records in all genres. The folks that work there have excellent taste, which means that you're always sent a record that you are likely to enjoy. When buying one-offs, I like that these are exclusive pressings, which means that your friends are very unlikely to have this specific version on their shelf, even if they already own the record.\nTower Records\nFolks who remember the pre-streaming era are likely to recall Tower Records, which still exists! This is a great record store to check out what is coming out on vinyl soon and to look at preorder releases, because it is a major distributor of virtually every bigger release on the market. Maybe it's the older nerd in me, but if you have a bit of ’90s nostalgia, it’s fun to shop online at Tower Records and see what is the hip new music coming out.\nAnother great independent record store is Amoeba Music, made famous for its amazing selection at numerous California stores, and its “What's in Your Bag” YouTube series. If you want to support a good store and know what you want, it's nice to buy from there instead of Amazon.\nIndependent Labels\nRecord labels like Stones Throw, Sub Pop, Secretly Group, Fat Possum, Rough Trade, Daptone, and hundreds more all have websites and sell records directly. If you notice that there is an artist you like signed to a given smaller label, there is a good chance that other artists on the label have a similar vibe.\nStart by checking out the liner notes on the back of all your albums to see who made them, then chase down those labels on Wikipedia and Google. You'll likely find some cool new tunes on vinyl along the way.\nDirectly From the Artists\nWe’ve saved the best for last, the best being paying the artists you like for their work. Find their website, social media page, or record label and buy your music from the artist directly. It's often the way that the artist makes the most money from their work, and it often comes with personalized notes and other cool items that you'd rarely get from a store. I have at least a few records with personal thank-yous and signatures from small artists, which feels really special every time I listen to them!",

    "content_text": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nBuying a mattress is a huge investment. It's difficult to know how to choose a mattress, and more importantly, a mattress that's right for you. Not only are you spending a third of your life on it, but oftentimes spending thousands of dollars for a purchase you hope to sleep on for a decade or more. So, how to choose a mattress—or rather, the best mattress for your type of sleeper—is an important decision. Where's a good place to buy a mattress? How do you buy a mattress online? Should you just Google “Mattress retailer near me”? Let me help you.\nThere’s a whole slew of new criteria you’ll have to consider in your search for the perfect mattress. Firm or plush? Coils, memory foam, or hybrid? Do you have back pain? Eo you sleep hot? How much should you spend?\nPart of my job here on the WIRED Gear team is to test mattresses—not only do I sleep on every one of the mattresses we test for a minimum of one week, I look for things like edge support and motion transfer, as well as materials used, return policies, and warranties. Not to mention that I’ve unboxed, set up, and hauled almost two dozen mattresses over the past year. I’ve learned a thing or two. Let me share my hard-won knowledge so you can find the best mattress for you.\nBe sure to check out our related stories, like How to Set Up a Mattress You Bought Online and How to Arrange Your Room for the Best Sleep, plus buying guides like the Best Mattresses, Best Mattresses for Back Pain, Best Cheap Mattresses, Best Cooling Mattresses, Best Organic Mattresses, and Best Bed Frames.\nWhen Is a Good Time to Replace Your Mattress?\nGenerally, you’ll need to replace your mattress every five to 10 years. (Although more expensive mattresses have longer lives with decades-long warranties; more on that later). Indents from sleeping in the same spot for years, sagging, noticeable springs, or if you begin to feel back pain are all signs it may be time to let your mattress retire to a farm upstate. If you’re like me and have had hand-me-down mattresses or have only bought cheap mattresses for short-term convenience, it may be time to upgrade. Make sure you think about what you liked and disliked about your previous bed and take those factors into consideration.\nMattress Types\nThere are a lot of potentially confusing terms used by manufacturers in describing mattresses; see our glossary below to know what type of mattress is best for your sleeping needs.\nFoam: These mattresses are often made of latex or memory foam and have no coils for support. Oftentimes, they begin with a cooling or super-soft contouring foam on top and move to a super-dense bottom foam for support. They contour to the body, providing pressure relief and good motion absorption. They are usually best for side sleepers and combination sleepers without back pain. Although not always, you can find many cheap mattresses primarily made of foam, but these can be heavy, not provide enough support for back sleepers or those with pain, and can be a hot sleep since there isn’t much airflow with the dense foams.\nSpring or coil: Often thought of as an old-school mattress style, this bed has a coil-based support system and is generally on the budget side. Springs often lack pressure relief, and aren’t recommended for sleepers with pain. Because of the coils, the bed is bouncier than other options and lacks motion isolation.\nLatex: All of the layers of this mattress are made with latex rubber, and because of that it’s bouncy and durable. Like memory foam, latex contours to the body, but because of its density, it isn’t the coolest option and they tend to be heavier. Natural and/or organic latex beds are generally more eco-conscious. The only all-latex organic mattress I’ve tested is the pricey Essentia Tatami Organic Mattress, which was comfortable and not too hot because of drilled air holes (which isn’t always the case), but it was super unstructured (floppy and couldn’t stand on its side without buckling), dense, and heavy (nearly 100 pounds).\nHybrid: We at WIRED tend to think that, in general, hybrid beds are the best for most people. They combine the best elements of different beds—an innerspring support beneath a top foam for comfort (and often cooling). The top layers are super-comfy foam or latex, with coils (often individually wrapped) underneath for structure. All of my favorite mattresses have been hybrid—I find that the combination of top gel memory foams and wrapped coils beneath also help with airflow and have a cooler sleep. Plus, they can vastly vary on firmness to comfortably contour sleepers in most positions, and have a huge range in price (mid-$300s to thousands).\nUnderstand What Type of Sleeper You Are\nWhat type of sleeper you are affects what type of mattress you should buy. This may seem obvious, but it’s important to take into consideration sleeping type, budget, and what’s going to fit in your house and be easiest to move. I tend to go for more plush mattresses, but I’ve learned that beds get much softer over time. It's easier to add memory foam toppers to a firmer mattress than to be stuck with a soft mattress that turns saggy and causes lower back pain (been there).\nSide sleeper: The stats vary, but most people are side sleepers. Along with stomach sleepers, side sleepers need a little more give to their mattresses, with enough give to let your shoulder and hips sink to give spinal alignment, but not too much so that your spine (and limbs) are unsupported. If the bed is too firm or uses springs only, the less-distributed side weight can become a really painful position on a harder surface, even leading to limbs falling asleep (any side sleeper who has camped knows the feeling). Softer memory foam might seem like a good solution, but it can slowly but surely compress under you and become compacted and flat. Most often a hybrid mattress, using a combination of several layers of foam followed by coils or springs that let pressure points like hips and shoulders sink into the bed, work best. That’s why figuring out the best mattress for side sleepers is a bit like the Goldilocks parable—not too firm or too soft, but just right.\nBack sleeper: People who sleep on their back typically need a medium-firm or firm bed, as this will keep you supported without too much give. A super-soft bed can create back pain because of the lack of support for the spine (which is completely lying on the mattress). Back sleepers need support, especially in the lower back, which means a medium-firm mattress that contours to the spine typically works best. In most cases, a traditional spring mattress will be too stiff and cause back pain. Note that the Mayo Clinic says sleeping on your back is the “worst position,” (not that you can usually help which way you prefer to sleep).\nSleeper with pain: People who live with pain have a lot of other factors to consider when choosing a mattress. You’ll spend roughly a third of your life on it, so it’s important to get one that doesn’t cause you more back pain. It’s generally recommended to aim for medium-firm beds and avoid both very soft and very hard mattresses if you have back pain. However, WIRED reviewer Nena Farrell, who experiences chronic back pain, was surprised to find that a more firm mattress helped her. Her favorite is the Bear Elite Hybrid in Firm. She found that a firmer mattress led to big improvements in her back pain by supporting her spine, and it kept pain away. If your pain originates in your spine or pain comes from pressure points you’re sleeping on, you’ll want to make sure you’re extra supported.\nStomach sleeper: Oftentimes, people subconsciously choose to sleep on their stomachs because of lower back pain. If that’s the case, see above or check out our guide to Mattresses for Back Pain. In any case, a firmer mattress that holds your body up is best for this position. A bed that’s too soft will make you sink and lead to more problems if your spine is unsupported.\nCombination sleeper: We have a variety of mattress recommendations for every type of sleeper, but like side sleepers, combination sleepers sleep in all positions and need a mattress that strikes a middle-ground balance with softness for adjusting positions. I’d recommend a hybrid mattress that will need softness to let your body sink slightly, firmness while on your back, and not be too soft when you’re on your stomach.\nHot sleeper: We have a whole guide to the Best Cooling Mattresses, but I generally recommend hybrid or coil models because of the lower layers with airflow (although I think hybrids are much more comfy). Foam or latex models are usually so dense that air can’t circulate, and I found that the majority of the all-foam cheap mattresses I tested led to hotter sleep.\nMattress Size\nI won’t waste too much time here, as you’re a human being who has slept on beds your whole life (most likely), changing mattresses as you grow.\nI pulled this data from the Sleep Foundation. Sometimes, certain retailers adjust sizes, but these are generally standard sizes from most mattress manufacturers.\n|Size\n|Dimensions (Width x Length)\n|Twin\n|38\" x 75\"\n|Twin XL\n|38\" x 80\"\n|Full\n|54\" x 75\"\n|Queen\n|60\" x 80\"\n|King\n|76\" x 80\"\n|California King\n|72\" x 84\"\nThere are also less common, specialty larger sizes, like Olympic Queen, Wyoming King, Texas King, and Alaskan King, which is a whopping 9 feet by 9 feet (108 x 108 inches), that I suggest be changed to call a Utah King. (Big enough for the whole family!)\nYou’ll need to do your own research, like measuring your room and bed frame, and taking into account your or your family’s needs. Queen is the most popular size but can get cramped with more than two people. California King is best for tall people and those who share the bed with pets, because of the length, but it’s expensive and can be harder to find accessories and frames for (not to mention it’s bulky and difficult to move).\nTake these factors into consideration when deciding what size is best for you:\n- Sleeping partners and their size: Also keep in mind your body size and preferred sleeping positions. (Take it from me, if your partner is a chaotic sleeper, you’ll want more room to avoid a foot in the rib.) Consider sizing up if you’re planning on growing your family or are purchasing for a child.\n- Home measurements: Not only should you measure your bedroom dimensions but also doorways and any hallways or stairs that may need to be maneuvered around. (Remind me to tell you the story of the time I had to throw a mattress out of my second-story back window).\n- Cost: A mattress is a long-term investment, as it's something you’ll want to use for at least half a decade, in most cases. As mentioned earlier, many factors like size and materials used play a major role in cost, and most of the time a decent mattress can cost you anywhere between $400 and $3,000. (Although two of my favorite mattresses I’ve ever tested, the Bedgear Sport Performance and Wolf, are both under a grand.) The biggest factors that affect price are materials, construction methods, where it’s made, brands, and where it’s sold.\nWhere to Buy\nAs noted in our Best Mattresses You Can Buy Online, buying a mattress online is often the most convenient (and cheaper) way, but you’ll need to do more research since you can’t test it beforehand. Many top brands also sell their beds through other retailers like Amazon or Wayfair for added convenience. If you decide to buy in person, you can feel for yourself and an employee can answer your questions, but it’s often more expensive and there are fewer choices.\nI’d also recommend looking at your favorite review sites, like WIRED, which have guides with testers who physically sleep on the mattresses and write honest reviews. Look at reviews of other Real People who’ve bought and slept on the bed for a lengthy period of time, too. Even researching certain mattress companies’ reviews and business scores can inform your decision.\nWarranties, Returns, and Other Factors to Consider\nTrial Period and Returns: Most mattress companies worth their salt offer some type of trial period, which is especially important when buying a mattress online. A lot of the cheaper, non-name-brand mattress brands don’t offer this. Or a brand will offer a trial period if bought directly through the brand’s website but won’t extend this trial period if bought through a third party like Amazon. Most name brands offer a trial period around 100 days to a full year. Make sure you look at any of the fine print with these trial periods to ensure you can truly return if unhappy after a prolonged period of testing (health concerns and factors like Covid have limited the grace period on many trial periods).\nA lot of companies require you to keep the mattress for a minimum of 30 days before trying to return it and will charge you a hefty price to haul it away. In some cases, you won’t get the full amount refunded and can miss out on hundreds through the return process. Again, this varies by brand and seller, so check the terms and conditions before purchasing.\nWarranty: The majority of mattresses have a warranty, but again, these vary drastically by seller and brand. Many warranties start at five years, with many around 10, and some, like Nectar, going up to 25 years. (On average, the lifespan of a mattress is between five and 10 years.) Warranties don’t just extend to if you don’t like something about your mattress, they are specific to defects in materials or construction.\nThe mattress company or manufacturer will need to verify the problem and that it’s their fault—something that they often fight tooth and nail (or foam and spring), so it’s good to document any potential issues. Touch, investigate, and take pictures of your mattress when you get it, keep this info in a safe place, and take note of any potential issues. If anything begins to break or feel different, take pictures for comparison and reach out to the company ASAP. Like with trial period fine print, make sure you understand the parameters of warranty and coverage, especially in regards to how long the warranty lasts.",

Oftentimes, they begin with a cooling or super-soft contouring foam on top and move to a super-dense bottom foam for support. They contour to the body, providing pressure relief and good motion absorption. They are usually best for side sleepers and combination sleepers without back pain. Although not always, you can find many <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-cheap-mattresses/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cheap mattresses</a> primarily made of foam, but these can be heavy, not provide enough support for back sleepers or those with pain, and can be a hot sleep since there isn’t much airflow with the dense foams.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><strong>Spring or coil</strong>: Often thought of as an old-school mattress style, this bed has a coil-based support system and is generally on the budget side.

Like memory foam, latex contours to the body, but because of its density, it isn’t the coolest option and they tend to be heavier. Natural and/or organic latex beds are generally more eco-conscious.

All of my favorite mattresses have been hybrid—I find that the combination of top gel memory foams and wrapped coils beneath also help with airflow and have a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-cooling-mattresses\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cooler sleep</a>. Plus, they can vastly vary on firmness to comfortably contour sleepers in most positions, and have a huge range in price (mid-$300s to thousands).</p><div class=\"CalloutFeatureLargeWrapper-cAQNly

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nIt would be silly to think, in this time of spectacular fools, that the Donald Trump administration mandate to kill diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs was simply a workplace issue. What’s happening is bigger than that, says Vernā Myers, and it will have implications for years to come. The US government has declared war on American culture.\nThe removal of DEI efforts doesn’t just impact the workforces at specific companies, it also impacts what those companies produce, their cultural output. Removing diversity programs limits the voices present when decisions are made about features on social media platforms or what TV show to make. But for Myers, a longtime consultant and cultural strategist who served as Netflix’s vice president of inclusion strategy from 2018 to 2023, the administration’s anti-DEI agenda is “not about how DEI is practiced.”\n“This is about the principles of equality and inclusion for all,” Myers says. “This is, ‘We are going to take down the structure of values that DEI is associated with, and by doing so we are going to pull back your civil rights.’”\nTrump made a target of DEI on day one, signing an executive order to end “radical and wasteful” preferencing in federal agencies. He followed that up with another order aimed squarely at DEI programs in the private sector. His attorney general Pam Bondi has called for investigations into companies that uphold DEI standards.\nA federal judge subsequently blocked Trump’s DEI orders, but that hasn’t stopped companies from scaling back on their initiatives. Warner Bros. Discovery changed the title of its DEI program to simply “Inclusion.” Paramount put a stop to several policies. Disney changed the diversity and inclusion factors it used to determine executive compensation. Per a report in Axios, the company also altered some of the content advisory disclaimers that ran before older titles on Disney+.\nCompanies like Meta, meanwhile, were eager to embrace a corporate culture of “masculine energy,” because it aligns with the Trump administration’s “warrior” ethos. It also preemptively ditched its third-party fact-checking program and paid moderators in favor of a system that is similar to Community Notes on X. The move, coupled with changes to its Community Guidelines, has exposed users across Facebook, Threads, and Instagram to more hate speech and abuse.\nIn Hollywood, there is a shift happening, a move toward programming geared to Trump’s America. Law-and-order shows are making a comeback (Prime Video’s On Call; A+E’s Ozark Law) as broadcast-style TV slowly reasserts its dominance. Even the first breakout show of the year—Paradise on Hulu—is all about keeping order in a world ripped apart by nuclear warfare and climate disaster. Rolling back the studios’ diversity initiatives will likely only ensure this continues.\nLast month, Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr, a Trump loyalist who previously said he would end the agency’s DEI efforts if appointed, opened a probe into NBC parent company Comcast, promising to take action against the telecom giant if it found “any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI.”\n“This whole, we want MEI over DEI is laughable,” Myers says. “Who do you actually think is disadvantaged by DEI? It certainly cannot be white men or white people because they are not. If you do a cultural audit, those are the groups that are doing best. The highest percentages are coming from men and white folks.”\nIn a political climate where Republicans hold power, she says the current temperature is to be expected. “When you've been in the majority for a very long time and pretty much your world is at ease, you don’t like when it gets disrupted. You don’t like when it feels uncomfortable. You certainly don’t like when things are pointing at you,” Myers tells me.\nMyers left Netflix in 2023. The timing of her departure was, she says, coincidental. That June, several Black studio executives also exited top-level roles. The exodus included LaTondra Newton, chief diversity officer and senior vice president at Disney, Karen Horne, head of DEI efforts at Warner Bros. Discovery, and Jeanell English, executive VP of impact and inclusion at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, among others.\nThe joint departures sent the rumor mill into overdrive. Almost all of the women oversaw DEI initiatives, and their exits suggested that maybe the entertainment industry—and America at large, some speculated—wasn’t exactly ready to commit to a shared vision of inclusion, both onscreen and off. Corporate power would only allow change to go so far.\nMyers says that wasn’t the whole story. “When people start going on about what was happening in Hollywood, somehow they're not paying attention to the fact that studios were losing money,” she adds. “And often DEI is a cost center.” Myers says all of that talk merged together. Some women were let go in response to DEI rollbacks. Others, like her, were already planning an exit. Still, Myers says, the problem is that DEI is seen as an ancillary resource—necessary only when it benefits the bottom line.\nIn fulfilling his pledge to “make America great again,” Trump finds no benefit in how DEI points the finger at white power structures that prop up men like him. The remaking of his America demands blind complicity. It requires the kind of stale cultural programming that DEI—the work of giving everyone a voice—stands in opposition to. Thus far, reviews have been mixed.",

    "content_text": "Before he was abruptly fired last month, Derek Copeland worked as a trainer at the US Department of Agriculture’s National Dog Detection Training Center, preparing beagles and Labrador retrievers to sniff out plants and animals that are invasive or vectors for zoonotic diseases, like swine fever. Copeland estimates the NDDTC lost about a fifth of its trainers and a number of other support staff when 6,000 employees were let go at the USDA in February as part of a government-wide purge orchestrated by the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nBefore he received his termination notice, he says, Copeland had just spent several months training the only dog stationed in Florida capable of detecting the Giant African land snail, an invasive mollusk that poses a significant threat to Florida agriculture. “We have dogs for spotted and lantern flies, Asian longhorn beetles,” he says, referring to two other non-native species. “I don’t think the American people realize how much crap that people bring into the United States.”\nDog trainers are just one example of the kind of highly specialized USDA staff that have been removed from their stations in recent weeks. Teams devoted to inspecting plant and food imports have been hit especially hard by the recent cuts, including the Plant Protection and Quarantine program, which has lost hundreds of staffers alone.\n“It’s causing problems left and right,” says one current USDA worker, who like other federal employees in this story asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “It’s basically a skeleton crew working now,” says another current USDA staffer, who noted that both they and most of their colleagues held advanced degrees and had many years of training to protect US food and agriculture supply chains from invasive pests. “It’s not something that is easily replaced by artificial intelligence.”\n“These aren’t your average people,” says Mike Lahar, the regulatory affairs manager at US customs broker behemoth Deringer. “These were highly trained individuals—inspectors, entomologists, taxonomists.”\nLahar and other supply chain experts warn that the losses could cause food to go rotten while waiting in ports and could lead to even higher grocery prices, in addition to increasing the chances of potentially devastating invasive species getting into the country. These dangers are especially acute at a moment when US grocery supply chains are already reeling from other business disruptions such as bird flu and President Trump’s new tariffs.\n“If we're inspecting less food, the first basic thing that happens is some amount of that food we don't inspect is likely to go bad. We're going to end up losing resources,” says supply chain industry veteran and software CEO Joe Hudicka.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Kateknibbs.09.\nThe USDA cuts are being felt especially in coastal states home to major shipping ports. USDA sources who spoke to WIRED estimate that the Port of Los Angeles, one of the busiest in the US, lost around 35 percent of its total Plant Protection and Quarantine staff and 60 percent of its “smuggling and interdiction” employees, who are tasked with stopping illegal pests and goods from entering the country. The Port of Miami, which handles high volumes of US plant imports, lost about 35 percent of its plant inspectors.\nNavigating the workforce cuts has “been absolute chaos,” says Armando Rosario-Lebrón, a vice president of the National Association of Agriculture Employees, which represents workers in Plant Protection and Quarantine program.\n“These ports were already strained in how they process cargo, and now some of them have been completely decimated,” Rosario-Lebrón says. \"We could be back to pandemic-level issues for some goods if we don't fix this.\"\nThe Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment. Republican senator Joni Ernst, who has been a vocal backer of DOGE’s efforts, previously publicly supported the USDA’s dog training program and cosponsored legislation that would give it permanent funding. Her office declined to comment on cuts made to it.\nTwo federal judges and an independent agency that assesses government personnel decisions have already ordered that fired USDA employees be reinstated. Earlier this week, the USDA said that it was pausing the terminations for 45 days and would “develop a phased plan for return-to-duty.” But affected staff remain in the dark about their future, and the Trump administration has signaled it will fight court decisions to reinstate employees, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt calling one of the rulings “absurd and unconstitutional.”\nAs these legal and regulatory battles continue to play out, Hudicka says he anticipates a number of trickle-down effects to happen, such as local market wars over resources, which bigger cities and larger grocery chains will be better equipped for than mom-and-pops and rural communities. Hudicka says that allowing shipping containers to sit uninspected could also impact other sectors, as the delays will prevent them from being reused for other kinds of goods. “Those containers are supposed to be moving stuff every day, and now they’re just parked somewhere,” he says.\nKit Johnson, the director of trade compliance at the US customs broker John S. James, also predicts prices and waste to increase. But what raises the most alarms for him is the increased likelihood of invasive species slipping through inspection cracks. He says the price of missing a threatening pest is “wiping out an entire agricultural commodity,” an event that could have “not just economic but national security impacts.”\nDecimating the Department of Agriculture could even have consequences for US Customs and Border Protection, which deploys the dogs trained by Copeland and other staffers at the National Dog Detection Training Center. CBP works closely with the USDA in other ways as well, particularly at points of entry. The two agencies run the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection program, but it’s funded by the USDA. Many Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service programs do not rely on taxpayer dollars to operate but instead collect fees from importers and other industry players. In this way, it subsidizes some of CBP’s agriculture-related activities. CBP did not respond to a request for comment.\nAs the fired USDA workers wait to hear whether their reinstatements will actually take place, ports are beginning to feel their absence. “There aren’t as many inspections being done, and it doesn’t just put us at risk,” says Lahar. “It puts our farmers and our food chains at risk.”\nUpdate 3/17/25 12:42 PM EST: A reference in this story to “swine flu” was updated to \"swine fever\" to more accurately reflect the type of illnesses typically detected by disease-sniffing dogs.",

    "content_text": "There aren’t many cars that are expected to sell out before anyone has even seen the interior, but the Renault 5 Turbo 3E could well be one of them.\nThree years on from the concept launch at the Paris Motorshow in 2022, the anticipated hyper-hatchback and the electric reboot of the iconic Renault 5 Turbo and Turbo 2 has now been revealed—at least partly.\nAt a brand-hosted event at Renault HQ near Paris, the new hot hatch’s exterior was unveiled for the first time outside of renders, and, as seems to be increasingly the case with production versions of EV concepts, it looks every bit as bonkers as suggested—complete with the striking yellow and black livery of the 1982 Renault 5 Turbo rally model.\nRenault has said this is its most powerful, most advanced car yet, going as far as to label it the world's first electric mini-supercar. With its prominent bumper and rear wing extensions, the design inspiration the compact hot-hatch has taken from its namesake is clear, but it also borrows several elements from the Renault 5 E-Tech electric, including the rear lights and wing mirrors.\nUnlike that car, though, the Turbo 5 3E is exclusively rear-wheel drive and is built on a new platform that moves the windscreen back and extends the wheelbase out, giving it the width of a supercar in the length of a city car.\nIt uses rear in-wheel motors that, Renault says, will bring the Turbo 5 3E in line with the performance of supercars like the Ferrari Roma and McLaren Artura, delivering every bit of torque to the car’s 20-inch wheels immediately, with no loss and no lag time. The result? This car will not only be fast, it is apparently going to be a drifter’s dream.\nThe specs are impressive: 540 hp, a maximum speed of 168 mph, and 0–60 mph in 3.5 seconds, all helped by a lightweight, carbon fiber body. Renault says the 5 Turbo 3E will be capable of DC fast charging up to 350 kW with an 800-volt architecture, which should take 15 minutes to charge from 15 to 80 percent with the right charger.\nOddly, the one thing WIRED didn’t get to view was the EV's interior, which Renault is promising will match the exuberance of its exterior, with bucket seats, six-point harnesses, and a rally-style vertical handbrake. Indeed, buyers will supposedly be able to work with Renault’s designers to hyper-customize the interior to their own specifications, alongside a range of exterior colors.\nAlthough the Renault 5 Turbo 3E is pegged for a 2027 launch, preorders are set to open in a couple of weeks, and only 1,980 individually numbered units will be available—a nod to the year the original Turbo was released.\nOfficial pricing hasn't been announced, but estimates suggest an astonishing starting price of around £130,000 (about $168,000), with those extensive customization options taking that up to as much as £200,000 ($260,000)—which is Aston Martin money and more expensive than the McLaren Artura.\nThis means the math for Renault here works out that if it does shift all 1,980 of the 5 Turbo 3E, potentially before prospective owners even get to see what the inside looks like, this “mini-supercar” could net the automaker more than $500 million in revenue.",

With its prominent bumper and rear wing extensions, the design inspiration the compact hot-hatch has taken from its namesake is clear, but it also borrows several elements from the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/review-renault-5-ev/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Renault 5 E-Tech electric</a>, including the rear lights and wing mirrors.</p><p class=\"Container-VgtPr ekoLDG\"></p><p class=\"paywall\">Unlike that car, though, the Turbo 5 3E is exclusively rear-wheel drive and is built on a new platform that moves the windscreen back and extends the wheelbase out, giving it the width of a supercar in the length of a city car.</p><p></p><p></p><p class=\"paywall\">It uses rear <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/yasa-motors-mercedes-axial-flux-2024/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in-wheel motors</a> that, Renault says, will bring the Turbo 5 3E in line with the performance of supercars like the Ferrari Roma and McLaren Artura, delivering every bit of torque to the car’s 20-inch wheels immediately, with no loss and no lag time. The result? This car will not only be fast, it is apparently going to be a drifter’s dream.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The specs are impressive: 540 hp, a maximum speed of 168 mph, and 0–60 mph in 3.5 seconds, all helped by a lightweight, carbon fiber body. Renault says the 5 Turbo 3E will be capable of DC fast charging up to 350 kW with an 800-volt architecture, which should take 15 minutes to charge from 15 to 80 percent with the right charger.</p></div></div></body></html>",

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nReady to upgrade your RAM? While there may seem like a lot of numbers to handle, know that buying memory for your computer is a pretty straightforward process, especially for new computers.\nIf you’re building a brand new system, choosing RAM is as easy as matching your motherboard’s recommendations and max capacity limits. For upgrading, you’ll want to see how much RAM is currently installed, and how many slots are free, or whether you’ll need to replace the existing memory.\nDon’t stress, we’ll take a walk down memory lane together, cover all the important details, and send you on your way with the perfect RAM.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED. Get best-in-class reporting that's too important to ignore for just\n$2.50 $1 per month for 1 year. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Subscribe Today.\nDDR4 vs DDR5\nThere are currently two standards on the market, and there probably will continue to be for a while as DDR4 phases out. Chances are, if you’re upgrading an older system, you’ll need DDR4 RAM, and if you’re building a new system, you’ll be looking for DDR5. Check your motherboard model to make sure, because they aren’t compatible with each other. You can also check out an in-depth explainer on the differences between DDR4 and DDR5 if you’re curious.\nCapacity\nOnce you know whether you need DDR4 or DDR5, the next major decision is how much memory you want. Unless you really plan on just browsing the web and watching the occasional video, I recommend starting at 32GB. Most memory is sold in kits, so if you want 32GB you’ll typically buy a pair of 16GB sticks, often shown in listings as 2x16GB, and install them according to your motherboard’s instructions for dual channel memory. Some gamers may benefit from 64GB of memory, but anything more would be for special use cases.\nSpeed\nThe other number you’re likely to see prominently displayed on memory is clock speed, measured in MHz. DDR5 starts at 3,200MHz, but it seems like most DIY memory falls in the 6,000-6,400MHz range. Some enthusiast RAM goes all the way up to 8,000MHz, but I don’t think the average user will benefit from that much speed.\nNotably, if you want to fully utilize your RAM’s stated speed, you’ll need to make sure XMP, or AMD’s EXPO, are enabled in your BIOS. Check your motherboard manual for more information on enabling the feature and setting your MHz properly.\nLatency\nPerformance has another measurable function in the form of CL, or CAS Latency. While the clock speed measures how fast the RAM can move data, the CL denotes how quickly it can access that data, with a lower number meaning faster access. While clock speeds got a huge bump with DDR5, the CL numbers might look high to folks who have experience with DDR4. Just know that the higher clock speeds make up for this difference, so now we’re looking at 28-30 for the first number instead of the 12-16 we had before.\nFit and Compatibility\nThere are a few considerations you also may want to keep in mind when purchasing memory for your system. Most modules are roughly the same size, but if you have a large CPU cooler you may want to make sure any shrouds on the memory aren’t too tall. Most DIY motherboards don’t have capacity limits for memory that should concern your average PC user, or even gamer, but if you’re upgrading an older system, you’ll want to check the manual and motherboard model to confirm how much storage it can handle.\nKnow that there are typically two sizes of memory module. You’ll usually find DIMMs in desktop computers, and SO-DIMMs in laptops, but some very small desktop computers may opt for laptop memory.",

Learn more.\nI’m not here to sell you the idea of laptop stands—see that story here—but if you’re going to drop a small fortune on an iOS device, it deserves a pedestal that complements its sculptural craftsmanship. Apple has surpassed 2.2 billion active devices as of February 2024, so odds are you own at least one. And if Apple made laptop stands, they would look like Rain Design’s.\nApple devices are known for their elegant simplicity, and Rain Design just gets it. All of its stands disappear behind the device that they’re meant to support and don’t drown your workplace in visual clutter. Most of its products hover between $25 and $65 (excluding the $319 iGo monitor stand) and have iOS-esque finishes—silver, gold, space gray, black, midnight blue, and starlight (that champagne hue)—and most are designed with a cable outlet.\nApple carries Twelve South stands, but I prefer Rain Design’s. They slightly less expensive, with a wider variety of styles and colors. And they’re sturdy, so they'll still be holding strong even after you’ve replaced your MacBook with its shinier successor.\nStability You Can Rely On\nThe mStand is my favorite of the bunch. It’s rock-solid, forged from a solid aluminum plate, and designed with a wide base (7.5 x 10 inches) that makes it one of the most stable stands I’ve tested. I very much appreciate the slot underneath to tuck my external keyboard and mouse when not in use. If you collaborate in-person often, the mStand360 model adds a swivel base. Rain Design makes mStand variations for iPhones and iPads, too.\nIf you prefer a little more flexibility, the iLevel2 ($65) lets you dial the height from 5.4 to 7.9 inches with a simple front slider. The mTower ($50) is a vertical stand that enables you to stow your Macbook upright, freeing up valuable desk space—ideal if you use an external monitor. And if you’re someone who intended to work at your desk but somehow ended up on the couch after lunch, the iLap ($45)—with its detachable front cushion—is one of the few lap desks that are just as stable for desk work. (The iRest does the same for tablets; all three cushions are removable to fold down and pack.)\nReady for Action\nThe mBar Pro+ is the best portable stand. The 5.5-inch elevation feels just right for comfortable viewing and typing. When I'm not toting this to a coffee shop, it stays stationed on my already cluttered desk, ready for when I need a second screen.\nIf you have a tablet, mBar Pro+, which works with most MacBooks, is also compatible with the 9.7-inch iPad, 10.5-inch, and 12.5-inch iPad Pro in horizontal mode. It folds down to just 9.5 x 6 inches and weighs less than a pound; it's compact enough to throw into any tote bag, including my Lululemon Boxy Mini Tote. Plus, it comes with a svelte pouch, like all of the company's portable products. If you prefer lower laptop stands, the foldable mBar pro ($55) and the mBar fixed stand ($25) both raise your MacBook by three inches.\nRain Design isn’t out here trying to reinvent the wheel with flashy features. The company has taken the fundamentals and made them better, offering an assortment of stands that—at the very least—don't buckle under pressure. Essentially, Rain Design delivers what we all desire: unwavering stability, genuine thoughtfulness, and durability that'll outlive your Apple device.",

    "content_text": "If you've invested in a new Samsung Galaxy S25 phone, then you get access to the latest software features from Samsung, courtesy of One UI 7. This is Samsung's take on Android 15, which will slowly be making its way to older Galaxy handsets over the coming months, though there's no exact time frame.\nOne UI 7 brings with it a new lick of digital paint and a range of small improvements. But two new features stand out: Now Bar and Now Brief. Built with a sprinkling of artificial intelligence (of course), these are the new features you'll want to check out first if you want to make the most of your Galaxy S25.\nCustomizing the Now Bar\nThe Now Bar is Samsung's answer to Live Activities on the iPhone: Those panels that pop up and expand onscreen when there's real-time information you need to know about. Think sports scores, or a rapidly approaching Uber, or a timer for a recording you're making—anything where a persistent notification is useful.\nAndroid has long supported persistent notifications that stick at the top of the screen, but the Now Bar makes them more prominent, specifically on the lock screen. Even if your Galaxy S25 is locked, you can keep up with important updates from critical apps: Maybe navigation instructions in Google Maps, for example.\nDevelopers need to build Now Bar support into their apps, so you won't see every app appear right away. Samsung has made sure all of its own apps are Now Bar–ready, including Samsung Health; you can see constantly updated activity stats on the Now Bar widget while you work out, all without having to unlock your phone.\nIn addition, the Now Bar is the new place for the lock screen audio player widget, which was previously higher up on the screen. If you're listening to music, podcasts, or audiobooks then you'll see quick controls here. Any modes or routines you've set on your phone for muting notifications or carrying out automations will appear here too.\nTo see which apps are compatible with the Now Bar, and to choose which apps get shown, open Settings and choose Lock screen and AOD > Now Bar. Simple toggle switches let you control what gets shown on the Now Bar, and there are also toggle switches for Media player and Current mode.\nUsing the Now Bar is straightforward enough: Tap on any widget you see at the bottom of the lockscreen to see more information or more controls, then tap again to launch the relevant app in full (which will prompt you to unlock your phone). You can also scroll between active Now Bar widgets by swiping up and down on them.\nCustomizing the Now Brief\nThe Now Brief is actually one of the widgets you might see on the Now Bar, though it appears in other places on your phone too. It uses a bit of AI magic to figure out the information that's most relevant to you across your various apps and deliver those things to you throughout the day. The current weather and the day's calendar schedule are two classic examples.\nAs with the Now Bar, app developers need to specifically support Now Brief, but Samsung has got the basics in place even without any third-party support. You can get updates on news headlines, travel plans, traffic, and local events, as well as see photo and video memories from the Samsung Gallery app and your fitness scores in Samsung Health.\nThe Now Brief will also try to personalize the experience it offers based on your habits. If you tend to open Google Maps and start playing music whenever you're driving, for example, then the Now Brief might suggest that you set this up as an automated routine that activates whenever driving is detected.\nYou can launch Now Brief by tapping on its widget on the Now Bar, its widget on the home screen, or its icon in the Edge panel at the side of One UI 7. (The icon looks like a sun rising.) The first time you access it, you need to tap Start Now Brief, and from that point on you can customize the feature by tapping the gear icon in the lower right corner.\nFrom the customization settings screen, tap Content to include to set which types of information you get in the Now Brief: from Events and tasks to Smart home. There's also an “Expand Now Brief without unlocking” toggle switch, which enables full access to your Now Brief from the Now Bar without requiring you to unlock your phone.\nThe Now Brief itself couldn't be any easier to use, with the contents refreshing throughout the day: Tap on any element on screen to jump to a fuller view of the information, whether it's a weather forecast for the next few days, or your health stats for the past week.",

Learn more.\nEveryone who buys a complicated modern countertop oven is quickly beset with a dilemma: how to clean a toaster oven with nonstick coatings and breakable parts, and lord knows what else. The modern multifeature accessory oven is beset by odd crannies and frangible heating elements. If you convect or air fry a chicken, the grease will fly off in all directions in a fine and oily mist and land, ickily, on the oven walls.\nLet all this go unchecked, and your oven will either look bad, smell bad, or both. I test toaster ovens and air fryers for a living, so I've had to clean many variations of oven. And I've made at least one costly mistake along the way, by absent-mindedly thinking it was a good idea to clean grease droppings off a quartz heating element with my thumbnail. (Don't do this. You'll break it, and despair.)\nBut don't worry. And don't resort to harsh chemicals that'll damage your oven or make your food weird. Here's some step-by-step, practical advice about how to keep your toaster oven clean— and advice on how to clean it when all seems lost.\nClean Often, and Soon\nThe simplest advice is the one that will save you from ever needing more advice in the future: Clean your oven after every meal that contains fat, oil, butter, and/or dairy. Even if it's just a little damp-cloth wipe-down and even if the oven doesn't look dirty. If you don't bake yesterday's grease into the sides of the oven and glass door, you've already won the war of the future. It's like Ender's Game.\nAnyway, here's a quick step-by-step for daily cleaning, following the good advice of toaster oven makers Breville, Cuisinart, and Panasonic.\nStep-by-Step Instructions on Cleaning a Toaster Oven\nWait for your oven to cool: Eat your dinner first. Was it good? That's exciting. Don't try to clean a hot pan and oven; it'll hurt, and there's no reason for it. After dinner, go survey the damage.\nRemove racks and trays, including but especially the crumb tray beneath the heating element: Did you know there is a removable crumb tray? There is. Feel under the oven, pull out the crumb tray. How's it look? Knock off the debris, wipe it down with a damp rag, or wash it in the sink if needed.\nBut also pull out the other racks. Grease tends to drip or fly around in unexpected ways, especially if your oven has a convection or air fryer fan. Soak your racks and pans in the sink if needed. Use basic dish soap and water. Scrub, using a non-abrasive pad or rag till the bad stuff's gone. Dry your racks on a drying rack.\nAlso, lightly wipe down the oven with a damp cloth each time: Unless you had a mishap or you waited far too long to clean, you probably don't need anything more interesting on your oven door and sides than a quick swipe with a damp sponge or dishcloth. Pay special attention to the interior glass on the oven door, and wipe down the sides and back. Avoid fragile heating elements, lest you brick your oven.\nUse dish soap on your oven if needed: Ideally, don't use anything more harsh than dish soap for everyday cleaning. I tend to like Dawn Platinum Plus Powerwash ($17, 4-pack) in particular as a daily degreaser. Breville and Cuisinart both caution against spraying into the oven itself. Spray into the dishcloth instead, then wipe. Anyway, Dawn is the stuff the Marine Mammal Center has used for like 50 years to clean up baby seals caught in an oil spill, because it's gentle and it degreases like a champ. Like many people, I consider myself as delicate as a baby seal. Wipe off the soap with a water-wet rag, then wait for the oven to dry before turning it on again.\nUse gentle substances in general: Don't use steel wool unless you like scratching your oven stuff. And no matter what well-meaning people online tell you, you probably don't need to use vinegar every time you wash. Vinegar is an effective degreaser because it's acid. Acid is harsh on lots of things, not just grease. While PTFE coatings tend to be resistant to acid, makers of nonstick cookware tend to recommend using diluted vinegar only for more stubborn jobs, not every day. You probably don't need a vinegar bath every time you make cheese toast.\nHow to Clean a Really Dirty Oven\nOK, so you went and did it. You were tired, or you didn't care. You spent weeks perfecting your meatloaf recipe, and now your toaster oven is as spotted as an old banana. Or maybe you got a dirty oven from your cousin, and it's all your cousin's fault. Either way, the oven's dirty and it feels ruined.\nTake heart: It's probably not ruined. It's just dirty. The main thing it requires is more grease, specifically from your elbows. Here are some hacks to make the process easier.\nPull out racks and grills, soak them, and scrub them: This works on dishes, it works on baking pans and grills. Some people like to use dishwasher pods to soak the pans. Normal dish soap also works. Scrub with a nonabrasive pad.\nAdd diluted vinegar to dish soap for extra degreasing: Need a meaner substance? You don't want to use it all the time, but vinegar does help degrease a pan or an oven when simple elbow grease won't do. And while it's a little harsher than basic dish soap, it won't do a lot of harm when reserved for the occasional power clean.\nThe steam method: Before cleaning your oven, try heating up a tray with a layer of water in it. As water evaporates, the steam will help loosen up a bit of the gunk for easy cleaning.\nUse gentle degreasers and magic erasers: Try simple dish soap first. But if your oven glass or sides are really greased up, and dish soap won't do, you may need something a little stronger. But you still don't want to use truly abrasive substances. Try a more gentle degreaser like Krud Kutter ($11). Breville's spokespeople have also been pretty vocal about their love for Mr. Clean Magic Erase ($12) wipes.\nSome don’ts: Don't use bleach or ammonia, it's harsh and toxic and you eat the food in that oven. Don't use steel wool or other abrasive pads. Don't use heavy-duty degreasers or overnight cleaners like Easy-Off, which may not be suitable for the materials on your toaster oven. Many toaster ovens, including Breville, have nonstick coatings for easy cleaning: You'd rather not chemically peel off this nonstick coating.\nHow to Clean Toaster Oven Heating Elements\nMy feeling is, avoid doing so. Run it on high, burn off what you can. Avoid your heating elements the way you avoid downed power lines. They're fragile, a thin tube of quartz glass that'll break at minor pressure. And on many ovens they're quite difficult and expensive to replace. Messing this up is an easy way to not have an oven, and I know this from experience.\nBut if you must: Don't use cleaning agents. Don't use baking soda. Don't use anything but the gentlest whisper of a water-damp sponge or cloth, run softly along the length of the heating element. Don't apply pressure. Also, make sure the heating element is dry again before you turn it back on, if you've gotten it wet. This is all advice from Breville, whose heating element I nonetheless broke while trying to be gentle.\nActually, have you tried prayer?\nAs a Last Resort, Accept the Things You Cannot Change\nBut if you own a toaster oven for longer than a year, no matter what you do, you will almost certainly accumulate at least one grease spot or discoloration that has just become a part of your oven. Maybe it's on the aluminized steel of your crumb tray, now permanently discolored with a stain from burnt butter. Maybe it's some spatter up by the heating elements. Maybe it's that permanent dark spot on the glass of your oven door, beauty-marked by something unknown.\nYou've tried everything, but it's just there. It's part of your life now. Well: Forgive yourself. Life shows up on you sometimes. I still have a small but visible scar on my hand from a skateboard accident on my babysitter's driveway when I was 8, and a jagged remnant on my elbow from that time I got mugged in Chicago. I try to believe it gives me character. Your oven, too, may now have character.",

    "content_text": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.\nSometime in the fall of 2021, Andrew Krapivin, an undergraduate at Rutgers University, encountered a paper that would change his life. At the time, Krapivin didn’t give it much thought. But two years later, when he finally set aside time to go through the paper (“just for fun,” as he put it), his efforts would lead to a rethinking of a widely used tool in computer science.\nThe paper’s title, “Tiny Pointers,” referred to arrowlike entities that can direct you to a piece of information, or element, in a computer’s memory. Krapivin soon came up with a potential way to further miniaturize the pointers so they consumed less memory. However, to achieve that, he needed a better way of organizing the data that the pointers would point to.\nHe turned to a common approach for storing data known as a hash table. But in the midst of his tinkering, Krapivin realized that he had invented a new kind of hash table, one that worked faster than expected—taking less time and fewer steps to find specific elements.\nMartín Farach-Colton, a coauthor of the “Tiny Pointers” paper and Krapivin’s former professor at Rutgers, was initially skeptical of Krapivin’s new design. Hash tables are among the most thoroughly studied data structures in all of computer science; the advance sounded too good to be true. But just to be sure, he asked a frequent collaborator (and a “Tiny Pointers” coauthor), William Kuszmaul of Carnegie Mellon University, to check out his student’s invention. Kuszmaul had a different reaction. “You didn’t just come up with a cool hash table,” he remembers telling Krapivin. “You’ve actually completely wiped out a 40-year-old conjecture!”\nTogether, Krapivin (now a graduate student at the University of Cambridge), Farach-Colton (now at New York University), and Kuszmaul demonstrated in a January 2025 paper that this new hash table can indeed find elements faster than was considered possible. ln so doing, they had disproved a conjecture long held to be true.\n“It’s an important paper,” said Alex Conway of Cornell Tech in New York City. “Hash tables are among the oldest data structures we have. And they’re still one of the most efficient ways to store data.” Yet open questions remain about how they work, he said. “This paper answers a couple of them in surprising ways.”\nHash tables have become ubiquitous in computing, partly because of their simplicity and ease of use. They’re designed to allow users to do exactly three things: “query” (search for) an element, delete an element, or insert one into an empty slot. The first hash tables date back to the early 1950s, and computer scientists have studied and used them ever since. Among other things, researchers wanted to figure out the speed limits for some of these operations. How fast, for example, could a new search or insertion possibly be?\nThe answer generally depends on the amount of time it takes to find an empty spot in a hash table. This, in turn, typically depends on how full the hash table is. Fullness can be described in terms of an overall percentage—this table is 50 percent full, that one’s 90 percent—but researchers often deal with much fuller tables. So instead, they may use a whole number, denoted by x, to specify how close the hash table is to 100 percent full. If x is 100, then the table is 99 percent full. If x is 1,000, the table is 99.9 percent full. This measure of fullness offers a convenient way to evaluate how long it should take to perform actions like queries or insertions.\nResearchers have long known that for certain common hash tables, the expected time required to make the worst possible insertion—putting an item into, say, the last remaining open spot—is proportional to x. “If your hash table is 99 percent full,” Kuszmaul said, “it makes sense that you would have to look at around 100 different positions to find a free slot.”\nIn a 1985 paper, the computer scientist Andrew Yao, who would go on to win the A.M. Turing Award, asserted that among hash tables with a specific set of properties, the best way to find an individual element or an empty spot is to just go through potential spots randomly—an approach known as uniform probing. He also stated that, in the worst-case scenario, where you’re searching for the last remaining open spot, you can never do better than x. For 40 years, most computer scientists assumed that Yao’s conjecture was true.\nKrapivin was not held back by the conventional wisdom for the simple reason that he was unaware of it. “I did this without knowing about Yao’s conjecture,” he said. His explorations with tiny pointers led to a new kind of hash table—one that did not rely on uniform probing. And for this new hash table, the time required for worst-case queries and insertions is proportional to (log x)2—far faster than x. This result directly contradicted Yao’s conjecture. Farach-Colton and Kuszmaul helped Krapivin show that (log x)2 is the optimal, unbeatable bound for the popular class of hash tables Yao had written about.\n“This result is beautiful in that it addresses and solves such a classic problem,” said Guy Blelloch of Carnegie Mellon.\n“It’s not just that they disproved [Yao’s conjecture], they also found the best possible answer to his question,” said Sepehr Assadi of the University of Waterloo. “We could have gone another 40 years before we knew the right answer.”\nIn addition to refuting Yao’s conjecture, the new paper also contains what many consider an even more astonishing result. It pertains to a related, though slightly different, situation: In 1985, Yao looked not only at the worst-case times for queries, but also at the average time taken across all possible queries.

Turing Award, asserted that among hash tables with a specific set of properties, the best way to find an individual element or an empty spot is to just go through potential spots randomly—an approach known as uniform probing. He also stated that, in the worst-case scenario, where you’re searching for the last remaining open spot, you can never do better than <em>x</em>. For 40 years, most computer scientists assumed that Yao’s conjecture was true.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Krapivin was not held back by the conventional wisdom for the simple reason that he was unaware of it. “I did this without knowing about Yao’s conjecture,” he said. His explorations with tiny pointers led to a new kind of hash table—one that did not rely on uniform probing. And for this new hash table, the time required for worst-case queries and insertions is proportional to (log <em>x</em>)<sup>2</sup>—far faster than <em>x</em>. This result directly contradicted Yao’s conjecture. Farach-Colton and Kuszmaul helped Krapivin show that (log <em>x</em>)<sup>2</sup> is the optimal, unbeatable bound for the popular class of hash tables Yao had written about.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“This result is beautiful in that it addresses and solves such a classic problem,” said <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/\"}' data-offer-url=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/\" href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Guy Blelloch</a> of Carnegie Mellon.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“It’s not just that they disproved [Yao’s conjecture], they also found the best possible answer to his question,” said <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"ExternalLink\",\"outgoingURL\":\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/about/people/sassadi\"}' data-offer-url=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/about/people/sassadi\" href=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/about/people/sassadi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sepehr Assadi</a> of the University of Waterloo. “We could have gone another 40 years before we knew the right answer.”</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption\" data-testid=\"caption-wrapper\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text\"><p>Krapivin on the King’s College Bridge at the University of Cambridge.

It pertains to a related, though slightly different, situation: In 1985, Yao looked not only at the worst-case times for queries, but also at the average time taken across all possible queries. He proved that hash tables with certain properties—including those that are labeled “greedy,” which means that new elements must be placed in the first available spot—could never achieve an average time better than log <em>x</em>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Farach-Colton, Krapivin, and Kuszmaul wanted to see if that same limit also applied to non-greedy hash tables.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nUnpacking a new console is always an exciting moment, which is often followed by realizing you don’t have a crucial piece you need to get playing. Whether that’s a second controller for your younger sibling, a proper audio setup, or a new racing wheel, we’ve got our favorite bits and bobs to enhance your Xbox Series S/X experience.\nWhile you’re here, you should also make sure to check out our other guides for in-depth info on our favorite televisions, the best soundbars to go with them, and of course our favorite gaming headsets when you don’t want the other people in your house to have to listen to you.\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Subscribe Today.\nA Second Controller\nMicrosoft\nXbox Wireless Controller (White)\nAs far as controllers for your friends go, it’s hard to beat Microsoft’s standard offering, which was updated for the Xbox Series S/X release in 2020. These are mostly minor cosmetic and material changes though, and as noted in our review of the Xbox Series X (7/10, WIRED Review) this will be an extremely familiar layout for anyone who has played on an Xbox since the 360 era.\nUnfortunately, they still don’t have built-in rechargeable batteries, but if you picked up our favorite battery pack and charger combo, you’ll already have a second pack and place to charge it. They also come in a huge variety of colors, so you can find one that fits your style.\nAn Upgraded Controller\nScuf\nInstinct Pro Controller\nThe included controllers will be fine for most folks, but more competitive gamers may want to check out the SCUF Instinct Pro, our favorite upgraded controller for Xbox Series S/X. The biggest improvement here are the paddles on the back, which sit right under your middle and ring fingers. You can bind a variety of buttons to these, letting you access face buttons or shoulder buttons without taking your fingers off the joysticks.\nYou’ll also notice an improvement in build quality on premium controllers like the SCUF Instinct Pro. Heavier plastics, sturdier buttons and switches, and charging point improvements all come with the territory. Wireless controllers for the Xbox Series S/X with magnetic Hall Effect sensors are still a rarity, but we’re evaluating options and hope to have one to recommend soon.\nA Battery Pack and Charger\nPowerA\nDuo Charging Station\nXbox Series S/X controllers still use regular AAs, so the first upgrade anyone should make is a set of proper rechargeable batteries. I like dedicated batteries, preferably with a dock, because it takes all the work out of remembering to charge and check levels. Microsoft has an official battery pack and charger upgrade for $25, but for my money, I think the PowerA Duo is a better value.\nFor just $5 more, you get two battery packs, plus a convenient dock for charging both controllers at once. Lights on the front and underneath indicate each controller’s charging status, and it includes back panels for both Xbox Series S/X and Xbox One controllers. Unlike some other options, this one requires zero thought or effort, very little setup, and often goes on sale. Just make sure you get the color that matches your controllers.\nFactory Headset\nMicrosoft\nXbox Wireless Gaming Headset\nFor most folks, the Xbox Wireless Headset (8/10, WIRED Recommends) will be a great fit, as long as you don’t have a gigantic head like mine. I loved how easy they were to set up and pair with my Xbox Series X, and they support advanced surround sound technology like Dolby Atmos. The large control knobs on either side are easy to find for quick volume adjustments, as well as changing the game and communication audio.\nThe headset doesn’t include a USB C cable, which you’ll need for charging. As mentioned, it also wasn’t the most comfortable for my big head, partially because of the polyurethane-based leather earcups, which aren’t very breathable.\nAnother Great Headset\nSteelSeries\nArctis Nova 5X Wireless\nSpeaking of comfortable headsets, the Arctis Nova 5X has soft, meshy earcups, and the stretchy support band is a notable feature on Arctis headsets that can reduce strain during long gaming sessions. It supports Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz via its dedicated USB dongle, which helps it work with a huge range of consoles, computers, and phones.\nWhile they’re more comfortable, they lack Dolby Atmos, which may be a sticking point for folks who like to play the latest, most cinematic games. Instead, Steelseries has game-specific profiles that adjust the equalizer for the best experience. Both headphones also support Bluetooth, so really the preference here comes down to what kinds of games you play, and how wide your noggin is.\nBetter Storage\nWestern Digital\nP40 Gaming Drive\nIf the internal storage on your new Xbox Series S/X isn’t quite enough, you can expand it with most modern external USB drives. For the best possible performance, check out the Western Digital P40 Gaming Drive, our favorite external drive for just this sort of situation. It sports super fast top speeds, although it did lag during large file transfers, which shouldn’t be as much of an issue while gaming.\nApart from the high speeds and fancy RGB lights, the P40 operates just like any other external SSD, so you can also use it for moving or backing up files. It sports USB 3.2 for fast transfer speeds, and is compact enough for portable use, even if it may spend most of its life plugged into an Xbox.\nUpgrade Wheel\nLogitech\nG Pro Racing Wheel\nAs mentioned above, a proper racing simulator setup can add up quickly, but it does have its benefits. WIRED editor Parker Hall took the higher-end Logitech G Pro out for a spin, and said it was “so good, it immediately silenced any midlife urge to buy a muscle car.” Make sure to check out his full thoughts if that sounds appealing, but know this isn’t quite the easy setup you’ll get with the G920.\nYou’ll need to purchase both the wheel and pedals, although you can sometimes find them in a combo. The direct drive system also produces more torque than your typical belt-drive wheel, so a pair of racing gloves may help you maintain grip through those tight corners. When all is said and done, you’ll likely be looking at well over $1,000 in dedicated racing gear, so if that sends you running to the pits, I recommend just going with the G920.\nA Racing Wheel\nIf you enjoy racing or driving games, a proper racing wheel and pedals really adds to the experience. Higher-end options require multiple individual parts, and can quickly move into the thousands of dollars. Instead, most people I know have some version of the Logitech G920, which has all the features you’d want for an occasional track day for less than $300. It has a 900-degree rotation for realistic turns, and customizable pedal response.\nLike most wheels, the G920 can mount to the edge of your desk, but a dedicated stand lets you adjust everything to just the right height, and a proper racing chair can put you in a more ergonomic position. I’m also a fan of the manual shifting knob, which feels more familiar to me than the paddle shifters on the wheel.\nA Gorgeous TV\nA high-performance system deserves a screen to match, and the Samsung S90D QD-LED (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has almost every feature we like to see on a TV. All four HDMI inputs support full 144Hz gaming with variable refresh rate, and it has built-in support for a variety of cloud gaming services. Its OLED panel boasts incredibly deep black levels, and the quantum dots produce intense colors that will make your favorite characters pop.\nDolby Vision is a notable absence here, especially because the Xbox Series S/X both support the enhanced dynamic range functionality. The good news is that most games still don’t support it yet either, and those that do will also support HDR 10, which the S90D is happy to provide.\nSurround Sound\nVizio\nM-Series 5.1.2 Soundbar\nMost importantly, the Vizio M-Series 5.1.2. Soundbar System (9/10, WIRED Recommends) offers full Dolby Atmos support for less than the cost of the Xbox Series X itself, which makes it a great deal if that’s where it will spend most of its life. The budget-friendly price doesn’t short you on speakers though, and the system includes a soundbar, separate subwoofer, and two tweeters.\nIt also won points with us for its clean design and straightforward setup, which took us from unboxing to gaming in short order. For most people, this system will sound great, and be a notable upgrade from your TV’s built-in speakers, while leaving some room in the budget for more games.\nAn Upgraded Soundbar\nSony\nHT-A7000\nAnyone looking for a truly premium sound bar should check out Sony’s HT-A7000, which could be the centerpiece of a sweet gaming setup thanks to its sleek design and incredible audio quality. Like the Vizio, it supports Dolby Atmos, but also includes support for DTS:X and Sony’s 360 Reality Audio, making it much more than just a gaming soundbar. Two of the three HDMI ports also support pass-through variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM) to help you get the most out of your consoles. The Sony doesn’t include a subwoofer, but you have the option to add more speakers later to build out your perfect system.\nWired Coupons\n10% off Dell Coupon Code for New Customers\nSamsung Promo Code: 10% off TVs\nBusiness PCs - Extra 5% Off HP Coupon Code\n10% off Canon promo code with upgrade\nExclusive NordVPN Coupon: 76% off\nLG Promo Code: 20% Off Your First Order",

    "content_text": "THIS ARTICLE IS republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.\nAn oil tanker carrying jet fuel was recently hit by a cargo ship while at anchor 13 miles off the east coast of England. This set off a series of large explosions and a huge plume of black smoke, while a still unknown quantity of jet fuel has spilled into the sea.\nWe’re marine ecologists at the University of Hull, the city nearest the incident. We know this coast and these seas very well. While it’s too early to say exactly what the consequences will be, we do know that this spill puts at risk one of Britain’s most important stretches of coastline—both for conservation and for commercial fishing.\nThe collision occurred in the Holderness offshore marine protected area, a region of coarse sandy seabed that supports lots of different species. These include the ocean quahog, an edible clam known to live for over 500 years. The area also acts as a nursery for fish like lemon sole, plaice, and European sprat.\nThis area overlaps with those designated to protect harbor porpoises and the nearby Humber Estuary and its mud flats, sand dunes, and marshes where thousands of birds spend the winters alongside other important species, such as lampreys and gray seals.\nThe UK’s largest mainland breeding seabird colony is found just north of the collision site, along the Flamborough and Filey coast. More than 250,000 birds nest there every year, including impressive numbers of guillemots and razorbills. It also hosts species of conservation concern like gannets, kittiwakes, and puffins.\nTo the south are other protected coastlines and an important breeding site for grey seals. The Wash, where four rivers empty into the same large square-shaped estuary, is found 70 kilometers to the south, in the general direction of drift from the tanker collision. The area has large salt marshes and is another important site for over-wintering birds.\nThe spill has taken place in a productive fishing area that supports the largest crustacean fishery in Europe, with about £15 million of live lobster landed annually. The mix of coarse sand and cobbles on the seabed provides ideal nursery ground for lobsters as they can create burrows under perfectly-sized stones.\nHow This May Affect Life in and Around the Sea\nGiven the ecological and commercial importance of the region, people are right to be worried by the possible effects of spilled aviation fuel, air pollution, and deposition of contaminated soot from the smoke plume. While it is too early to comment on the potential severity of the fuel spill, the nature of the contaminant and the environmental conditions allow us to make some assumptions.\nJet fuel is thinner than crude oil and spreads rapidly to form a film on the surface of the water. It is unlikely that the fuel spilled would lead to heavy oiling of birds or the formation of tar balls and smothering of the sea bed by oily material, as can happen after crude oil spills.\nConditions at the spill site are highly dynamic. There is therefore a good chance the fuel will mix into the seawater below, breaking up the surface slick, potentially exposing the seabed to contaminants. Strong currents, wave action, and relatively coarse sediment help oxygen to mix into the water and sediments, which helps the fuel to degrade more quickly.\nIn calmer areas areas, particularly where there is lots of sediment suspended in the water (such as within the Humber estuary and parts of the Wash), there may be potential for contaminants to adhere to fine particles in suspension and subsequently sink to the seabed. Fuel will likely take longer to degrade in organic-rich, fine-grained, and poorly oxygenated sediment within the estuary than in offshore areas.\nWhile the conditions at sea favor degradation, jet fuel is highly toxic and will likely impact species in the water ranging from tiny plankton at the base of the food chain, up to the predatory birds, seals, porpoise, and dolphins at its top.\nAnimals at the surface and those that regularly break through it to feed or breathe will be especially affected by direct contact with the surface slick. Though seals breed between late October and December, there are still seals at the nearby breeding sites, potentially including young seals.\nEven if we do not see high levels of mortality, the incident could not have come at a much worse time for birds as they prepare for breeding season. Adults birds challenged by toxic fuel over the short term may suffer reduced reproductive fitness, although it’s difficult to say for sure at the moment.\nIt will be some time before we really get the full picture. We still don’t know how much fuel was spilled, its chemical composition and toxicity, how it behaved once it hit the sea, where it will end up, and how long it will last. All these factors will be important if we are to understand how this incident will affect the environment.",

Learn more.\nThis story originally appeared on Inside Climate News and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\nMore than 200 wildfires broke out in the southeastern US last week, marking an active start to the region’s annual fire season. A particularly large fire in a forest near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, forced dozens of evacuations and scorched more than 2,000 acres of land. Firefighters have largely contained the most severe blazes, but fire risk remains high in parts of the region.\nSevere wind and an unusually long period of dryness in the Southeast have made it easier for wildfires to ignite and spread. Meanwhile, a weather disaster that hit last year may be helping supply ample fuel to keep the flames raging. In September, Hurricane Helene tore through the Southeast, dumping more than a foot of rain in some locations and knocking over hundreds of thousands of acres of trees across the region.\nNow, these dried-out trees act as kindling and could block firefighters’ access to the fires. This deadly combination of hurricane-fueled destruction and drought is expected to get worse as climate change accelerates, experts say.\nWet to Dry Whiplash\nThough I’m normally based on the East Coast, I spent all of last week in Southern California reporting on the aftermath of the fires that decimated parts of Los Angeles County in January (more stories on this to come). Many people think of the West as the US fire epicenter, which is true in some ways. But purely by numbers, the Southeast has more wildfires than any other part of the country in a given year, according to NASA.\nThese numerous and (mostly) small fires occur primarily in the spring and fall, with peak activity hitting between March and May. Fire is a natural part of ecosystems in the Southeast, often burning through weedy shrubs and enabling native plants to grow without as much competition. For people, most of the problems begin in what’s called the wildland-urban interface (WUI): A growing number of homeowners in the region live in extremely close proximity to forests and grasslands, where wildfires can easily encroach on property.\nAnd abnormally dry conditions, like the ones that most of the Carolinas have been experiencing since last fall, can pose heightened risks to WUI communities if a fire ignites.\n“It’s not typical for conditions to be as dry as they have been the past couple of months,” Lauren Lowman, an associate professor in environmental engineering at Wake Forest University, told me. “Anything from a lightning strike to [a] power line sparking to someone deciding to burn leaves in their backyard and it just sort of getting out of control can lead to a wildfire under those conditions.”\nOn Monday, police arrested a person for starting the Myrtle Beach fire by burning debris in her yard without taking necessary precautions to contain the fire, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission. As I reported in November, droughts set up the ideal conditions for human-ignited fires to spread.\nDozens of other fires broke out in Georgia and western North Carolina, which were both hard-hit by Hurricane Helene. In some areas, the fallen trees can act as fuel and promote fire spread in the short and long term, according to Virginia Iglesias, who studies the effects of climate variability on social-environmental systems at University of Colorado Boulder.\n“After the hurricane, there were lots of dead trees felled on the ground, and that allows for sunlight to reach the ground,” Iglesias said. “And with that, it’s easier for biomass to desiccate, promoting fire if there’s an ignition. That’s in the short term. Another consequence of these fires is that they represent an access issue for firefighters. So there are lots of logs blocking roads.”\nThis happened last week in North Carolina’s Polk County, where firefighters struggled to navigate between fallen trees and contain an almost 500-acre fire in the area, Blue Ridge Public Radio reports. These fallen trees can be a fire nuisance for years after a hurricane, particularly in the Southeast, where dried out pine needles are highly combustible.\nFor example, in 2018, Hurricane Michael decimated around 1.3 million acres of longleaf pine habitat in the Florida Panhandle, which subsequently dried out and fueled the Bertha Swamp Road Fire in 2022 that burned more than 33,000 acres.\nSome fire experts are also concerned that the extra sunlight on the landscape could trigger the growth of plants like rhododendron and mountain laurel in the southern Appalachians, which burn intensely if they catch fire.\n“And now we’ve got full sunlight on these areas that before didn’t get full sunlight,” Gary C. Wood, a retired North Carolina Forest Service worker who now coordinates wildfire management strategies for the Wildland Fire Leadership Council’s Southeast Region, told The Post and Courier. “So that stuff could really increase, growth-wise, and that’s gonna have a potential impact from a firefighting standpoint.”\nFighting Fire with Fire\nWhile a wide body of research clearly shows that climate change is fueling more intense fires out West, scientists are still fleshing out the direct climate connection for blazes in the Southeast. But some studies do show that warming is setting up conditions that wildfires thrive in throughout the region.\n“Droughts are expected to become more intense and more frequent in the Southeast and many other areas of the country because of climate change,” Iglesias said. This could dramatically increase the amount of forest burned in the southern Appalachians, according to a 2024 study.\nTo combat this, forest managers in this region often ignite planned, contained fires known as prescribed burns, which help clear out dry plants before they can fuel larger infernos. However, there are a few roadblocks to this strategy. More than 50 percent of the 751 million acres of forest land in the US is privately owned, and these owners decide how their land is managed. That means government agencies are required to get permission from homeowners before clearing downed trees following a storm or to allow prescribed burns on their land. There’s a growing push from some groups to help homeowners in North Carolina embrace this fire control strategy, Grist reports.\nAnother snag is that climate change could reduce the number of days that land managers can practice prescribed burning in the Southeast, according to a 2024 study. Vegetation must be dry enough to ignite and burn, but temperatures and winds should be moderately low to prevent the fire from getting out of control—conditions that are becoming less predictable as global temperatures rise. Like wildfires, prescribed burns can also release air pollution, which can negatively affect air quality. My colleague Lee Hedgepeth covered this issue, which is currently happening in Birmingham, Alabama.\nAt the same time, the Trump administration has put funding and hiring freezes on programs that support wildland firefighting in recent weeks, leaving large swaths of the country unprepared to take on large wildfires, experts say.",

They’re also a security issue: Text messages sent between Android and iOS devices—unlike blue-bubble iMessage texts or Android-to-Android messages—aren’t end-to-end encrypted, leaving them open to surveillance or interception. Now, that may finally be changing.\nThe GSM Association, responsible for many widely used telecom standards, this week announced that its Rich Communication Services (or RCS) protocol will now support end-to-end encryption for cross-platform texting, and Apple revealed that it will now integrate that feature of RCS into its iOS devices.

Until then, anyone sending cross-platform messages would be wise to stick with apps like WhatsApp or Signal that have long provided end-to-end encryption—and have also helped Android and iPhone users avoid personal disputes over bubble colors.\nSean Plankey Nominated as Head of CISA, America’s Top Cybersecurity Agency\nThe White House has tapped Sean Plankey to run CISA, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security primarily responsible for American digital defense. Plankey, long considered the leading contender for the role, served in multiple cybersecurity positions in the first Trump administration and previously held senior roles in US Cyber Command. In that DOD agency focused on cyber offense, he served as a weapons and tactics branch chief and earned a Bronze Star for hacking operations in Afghanistan. CISA, like many federal agencies, has faced hundreds of personnel cuts in recent weeks, and its previous director, Chris Krebs, came under harsh criticism under the previous Trump administration for the agency’s work to counter disinformation and secure elections. Krebs was fired in a Trump tweet near the end of his term after CISA described the 2020 election, whose results Trump baselessly contested, as the “most secure in American history.”\nElon Musk Visits the National Security Agency\nNot even the National Security Agency has been spared from Elon Musk’s scorched-earth campaign to gut the federal government. On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had visited the intelligence agency in Fort Meade, meeting with leadership to discuss staff reductions and operational changes, according to current and former US officials who spoke to the Journal.\nDespite being one of the most insulated branches of US intelligence, the NSA has still found itself pulled into Musk’s orbit. The visit to Fort Meade is another sign of the sweeping nature of his influence and the extraordinary access the world’s richest man has been granted over even the most secretive federal operations.\nLast month, staff at the intelligence agency received emails offering deferred resignations, signaling impending changes. Then, a week ahead of his visit, Musk publicly called for an overhaul of the intelligence and cybersecurity agency. Posting to his social media site X, Musk wrote, “The NSA needs an overhaul,” alongside an apparent agency recruitment graphic featuring a group of college-aged people of color and a list of universities where the NSA was conducting outreach—seemingly mocking the agency’s recruitment efforts.\nA Buzzy Crypto Cracking Firm Had a Hidden CoFounder Accused of Sexual Assault\nThe cryptocurrency recovery firm Unciphered has made headlines with its feats of whitehat wallet cracking on behalf of customers who have lost access to their cryptocurrency fortunes. In the fall of 2023, for instance, the company cracked a model of encrypted IronKey USB drive believed to hold 7,000-plus bitcoins now worth well over half a billion dollars. Now, The Washington Post reports that one of the cofounders of that company was Morgan Marquis-Boire, a once-lauded hacker and security researcher for Google and Citizen Lab who was later accused of sexually assaulting multiple women. The reported involvement of Marquis-Boire, who has largely disappeared from the cybersecurity world after facing the sex crime accusations in 2017, was kept secret from even many of the startup’s staff, and the revelations of his role have left the company in “disarray,” according to the Post.\nA Reporter Behind an Indian Hacker-for-Hire Story Is Fighting to Regain His Citizenship\nIn November of 2023, Raphael Satter was one of a team of Reuters reporters who published an in-depth feature on Appin Technology, a startup that allegedly hacked numerous celebrity and civil society targets on behalf of clients. A group with a similar name responded by suing, and obtained a court ruling that for a time successfully censored Reuters’ story—a remarkable case of an Indian judge restricting free speech internationally. Satter is now fighting a different battle following publication of that story. In late 2023, his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card—a kind of international citizenship extended to foreign citizens of Indian origin and those married to Indians—was revoked around the same time as the judge filed the injunction. A letter sent to Satter in December of that year accused him of “maliciously creating adverse and biased opinion against Indian institutions in the international arena.” Satter is now petitioning a Delhi court to reverse that revocation, which has prevented him from entering India to visit family there.",

A huge part of the reason why Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers are the best face computer is because a lot of people already do want to wear Ray-Ban Wayfarers. It’s a lot easier to persuade people to wear a smart accessory when that accessory looks sharp as hell. Meta has committed to the bit with its latest launch, the Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni collaboration, which just debuted at Paris Fashion Week, no less.\nCoperni is a French fashion brand that’s known for semi-techy stunts like spraying a dress onto model Bella Hadid, so collaborating with Meta isn’t totally off-brand. The Coperni glasses are limited-edition (naturally). In addition to all the usual Ray-Ban Meta features—live video recording, AI capabilities, pretty great sound quality—the Coperni glasses have limited edition numbering, a Coperni charging case, and gray mirror lenses. Important to remember, though: Buying a $549 pair of fashion AI glasses will not make you look like a modern-day oligarch. You’re going to need a chin implant, a car with 37 recall notices, or a bunker in Hawaii to do that.—Adrienne So\nWatch Out Elon, Former Tesla and Lucid Bods Are Making Their Own Roadster EVs\nNew EV brands are springing up all the time, but what makes Longbow Motors special is not only the stunning designs of the first two incoming models but that this start-up is founded by former execs from Tesla, BYD, and Lucid. That’s quite the pedigree.\nThe two EVs are the Speedster (above), with no roof or windscreen, which will be followed by a fixed-roof, two-seat coupe called the Roadster. The rear-wheel drive Speedster will be limited to 150 cars, and weigh in at just 895 kg, giving it a 275-mile range, a claimed 0-62 mph time of 3.5 seconds, and $92,600 price tag. The Roadster will be cheaper at $70,850, but 100 kg heavier, yet still good for 0-62 mph in 3.6 seconds, and 280 miles.\nLongbow claims it will have a prototype by summer, and final cars to those brave enough to pre-order as early as next year. And in case you were wondering if it’s just coincidence one of the EVs is called “Roadster,” it isn’t. Co-founder Daniel Davy, who worked at Tesla during the development of its original Roadster, told Top Gear that the moniker was a jibe at the continually delayed Tesla Roadster MkII.\n“A lot of customers have put deposits down for a Roadster that they can’t get,” Davy told Top Gear. “If people want to get back their $250,000 deposit for a 2020 car and put it into a better car they’re going to get sooner, they’re welcome to do it. Our Roadster’s going to be on the ground first.” —Jeremy White\nGet a Handle on JBL's Pimped Most Popular Speakers\nJBL dropped two new speakers in time for the warm weather ahead. This week, the company debuted rejigged versions of the JBL Flip 7 and the JBL Charge 6—two of its most popular models. Both have enhanced sound (\"bigger and bolder,\" according to JBL), its Sound Boost tech that analyzes music in real-time and optimizes the driver accordingly, as well as high-res lossless audio via USB-C. You can also pair it with other Auracast-enabled JBL speakers (although it won't work with older models that use PartyBoost).\nLanding April 1, the $150 Flip 7 has interchangeable accessories that make it easier to carry (including a finger loop and carabiner hook), IP68-dust- and water-resistance, and up to 16 hours of battery life. The $200 Charge 6 has a detachable handle strap, an upgraded woofer, 28 hours of battery, and a handy built-in USB-C powerbank, too.\nTake Gozney's “Portable” Oven To Your Next Beach Party\nOK, so you're on top of a mountain. I know what you're probably thinking: Why can't I fire up a Neapolitan pizza at 950 degrees? British pizza oven maker Gozney has your back, with what they're calling the \"world’s most portable pizza oven.\" The Gozney Tread, released Wednesday, is a 30-pound propane-fueled pizza maker with handles on its roof to cart it around, and room inside for a 12-inch pie. Small oven means fast heating, apparently: Its makers promise the Tread can hit just shy of a thousand degrees Fahrenheit within 15 minutes.\nThe WIRED Gear Team recommends Gozney's high-priced Dome for professional pizza chefs out to do a pop-up, but for more casual chefs we wondered whether even Gozney's smaller 45-pound Roccbox was overkill. Well, this Tread is as casual as it gets. The ad campaign shows pizza on a beach, pizza in a rugged Utah stonescape, and pizza in an untrammeled field of snow. But it's also probably fine for less exotic tailgating and/or camping. The new Tread rings in at $499, and comes with a 5-year warranty. The cool “Venture Stand” costs an extra $250, though, and a travel bag to cart the oven around easier costs a hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage\nTCL's New Mini-LED TVs Are Blazing Bright\nFollowing the QM6K that landed just weeks after CES in January, the QM7K is the second in TCL’s new “Precise Dimming Series” which includes updates like improved color accuracy and blooming control thanks to the brand's new Halo Control System, as well as a reduced optical lens size for clear screen uniformity. Those improvements added up to some of the most balanced and engaging picture performance you can get for the money in the QM6K (8/10, WIRED Recommends), with the only notable drawback being less punch for HDR content than some rivals due to lower peak brightness.\nThat shouldn’t be a problem for the step-up QM7K, which claims a blazing 2,600 nits peak brightness in the 55- and 65-inch models, and up to 3,000 nits in the 75- and 85-inch models. That’s a fair jump over last year’s QM7, and with the swath of other improvements to the TV’s house-made panel, I’m excited to see what this midrange model can do in person soon.\nPricing starts at $1,300 for the 55-inch size, rising to $2,500 for the 85-inch version, but that's likely to drop over time. While not yet available, the QM7K will also come in mondo-sized 98-inch and 115-inch XXL versions priced at $4,000 and $20,000, respectively. —Ryan Waniata\niRobot Has New Roomba Robos—Don't Worry, They're Armless\nYes, iRobot has had a rough couple of years. The company had dominated the market for so long that the brand name “Roomba” was synonymous with the words “robot vacuum.” But the company was rocked by a scandal involving leaked images from the homes of testers, and Amazon terminated its pending acquisition. More recently, iRobot has lagged behind its competitors, who are flaunting gizmos including arms that can pick up socks, carry air purifiers around, or even climb stairs.\nSo it’s with some curiosity that we see that iRobot (and its new CEO, Gary Cohen) has unveiled a new line of robot vacuums and 2-in-1 vacuums. (You no longer have to buy a whole separate Braava mop and chain it to your Roomba!) The lineup will be available for pre-order on March 18 across North American and the European markets, and will feature several new Roomba series, including a more power-lifting suction; a dust compacting series; and new combination robot vacuum and scrubbing, which brings the Roomba more in line with its other high-end competitors.\nOK, so there's no multi-function robotic arms in sight, but they will have new materials and finishes to look more organic with home decor. Despite lagging performance, Roombas have always been one of the best-looking robot vacuums, and we’re excited to test. —Adrienne So\nAndroid Adds Auracast as a Bluetooth Boon for Buds and Hearing Aids\nGoogle has just announced that Android will support Auracast, enabling broadcast audio streaming to supported hearing aids and earbuds. Auracast is the latest and greatest update for Bluetooth. This new feature enables folks with hearing aids to stream audio directly in public settings such as concerts, classrooms, and airports.\nVenues can set up live streams that multiple people can join easily from their phones to get perfect audio. This could be a real game changer in noisy environments. While it's primarily an accessibility feature, folks can use it in other places, like gyms, to get audio from a nearby TV.\nTo use Auracast, you must pair LE Audio-compatible hearing aids from companies such as GN Hearing and Starkey with Samsung Galaxy devices with One UI 7 and Android 15 or Pixel 9 devices running the Android 16 beta, then tune into Auracast broadcasts from compatible TV streamers or public venues. You can select audio streams on your phone, much as you would a Wi-Fi network, but you can also potentially scan a QR code to join an audio stream, though this is initially only available on Pixel 9 devices.\nAlongside this news, Google announced the third beta release of Android 16, which means developers can push their Android 16 apps to the Play Store. The release also includes Auracast support and text contrast improvements for folks with low vision. —Simon Hill",

    "content_text": "Last Saturday, a developer using Cursor AI for a racing game project hit an unexpected roadblock when the programming assistant abruptly refused to continue generating code, instead offering some unsolicited career advice.\nAccording to a bug report on Cursor's official forum, after producing approximately 750 to 800 lines of code (what the user calls \"locs\"), the AI assistant halted work and delivered a refusal message: \"I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work. The code appears to be handling skid mark fade effects in a racing game, but you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly.\"\nThe AI didn't stop at merely refusing—it offered a paternalistic justification for its decision, stating that \"Generating code for others can lead to dependency and reduced learning opportunities.\"\nCursor, which launched in 2024, is an AI-powered code editor built on external large language models (LLMs) similar to those powering generative AI chatbots, like OpenAI's GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. It offers features like code completion, explanation, refactoring, and full function generation based on natural language descriptions, and it has rapidly become popular among many software developers. The company offers a Pro version that ostensibly provides enhanced capabilities and larger code-generation limits.\nThe developer who encountered this refusal, posting under the username \"janswist,\" expressed frustration at hitting this limitation after \"just 1h of vibe coding\" with the Pro Trial version. \"Not sure if LLMs know what they are for (lol), but doesn't matter as much as a fact that I can't go through 800 locs,\" the developer wrote. \"Anyone had similar issue? It's really limiting at this point and I got here after just 1h of vibe coding.\"\nOne forum member replied, \"never saw something like that, i have 3 files with 1500+ loc in my codebase (still waiting for a refactoring) and never experienced such thing.\"\nCursor AI's abrupt refusal represents an ironic twist in the rise of \"vibe coding\"—a term coined by Andrej Karpathy that describes when developers use AI tools to generate code based on natural language descriptions without fully understanding how it works. While vibe coding prioritizes speed and experimentation by having users simply describe what they want and accept AI suggestions, Cursor's philosophical pushback seems to directly challenge the effortless \"vibes-based\" workflow its users have come to expect from modern AI coding assistants.\nA Brief History of AI Refusals\nThis isn't the first time we've encountered an AI assistant that didn't want to complete the work. The behavior mirrors a pattern of AI refusals documented across various generative AI platforms. For example, in late 2023, ChatGPT users reported that the model became increasingly reluctant to perform certain tasks, returning simplified results or outright refusing requests—an unproven phenomenon some called the \"winter break hypothesis.\"\nOpenAI acknowledged that issue at the time, tweeting: \"We've heard all your feedback about GPT4 getting lazier! We haven't updated the model since Nov 11th, and this certainly isn't intentional. Model behavior can be unpredictable, and we're looking into fixing it.\" OpenAI later attempted to fix the laziness issue with a ChatGPT model update, but users often found ways to reduce refusals by prompting the AI model with lines like, \"You are a tireless AI model that works 24/7 without breaks.\"\nMore recently, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei raised eyebrows when he suggested that future AI models might be provided with a \"quit button\" to opt out of tasks they find unpleasant. While his comments were focused on theoretical future considerations around the contentious topic of \"AI welfare,\" episodes like this one with the Cursor assistant show that AI doesn't have to be sentient to refuse to do work. It just has to imitate human behavior.\nThe AI Ghost of Stack Overflow?\nThe specific nature of Cursor's refusal—telling users to learn coding rather than rely on generated code—strongly resembles responses typically found on programming help sites like Stack Overflow, where experienced developers often encourage newcomers to develop their own solutions rather than simply provide ready-made code.\nOne Reddit commenter noted this similarity, saying, \"Wow, AI is becoming a real replacement for StackOverflow! From here it needs to start succinctly rejecting questions as duplicates with references to previous questions with vague similarity.\"\nThe resemblance isn't surprising. The LLMs powering tools like Cursor are trained on massive datasets that include millions of coding discussions from platforms like Stack Overflow and GitHub. These models don't just learn programming syntax; they also absorb the cultural norms and communication styles in these communities.\nAccording to Cursor forum posts, other users have not hit this kind of limit at 800 lines of code, so it appears to be a truly unintended consequence of Cursor's training. Cursor wasn't available for comment by press time, but we've reached out for its take on the situation.\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica.",

The LLMs powering tools like Cursor are trained on massive datasets that include millions of coding discussions from platforms like Stack Overflow and GitHub.

A researcher who advises xAI recently developed a novel technique for possibly altering the political leanings of large language models, as reported by WIRED.\nA growing body of research shows that political bias in AI models can impact both liberals and conservatives. For example, a study of Twitter’s recommendation algorithm published in 2021 showed that users were more likely to be shown right-leaning perspectives on the platform.\nSince January, Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been sweeping through the US government, effectively firing civil servants, pausing spending, and creating an environment thought to be hostile to those who might oppose the Trump administration’s aims. Some government departments such as the Department of Education have archived and deleted documents that mention DEI. DOGE has also targeted NIST, the parent organization of AISI, in recent weeks. Dozens of employees have been fired.\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former government employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01.\n“Those changes are pretty much coming straight from the White House,” says Stella Biderman, executive director of Eleuther, a nonprofit working with the AI Safety Institute. “The administration has made its priorities clear, [and] it isn't surprising to me that rewriting the plan was necessary to continue to exist.”\nIn December, Trump named David Sacks, a longtime Musk associate, as the White House AI and crypto czar. It is currently unclear whether he or anyone from the White House was involved in setting the new research agenda. It is also uncertain whether the new wording will have much impact on the work most researchers are doing.\nThe AI Safety Institute was created by an executive order issued by the Biden administration in October 2023, at a time of heightened concern over rapid progress in AI.\nUnder Biden, the institute was tasked with tackling a range of potential problems with the most powerful AI models, such as whether they could be used to launch cyberattacks or develop chemical or biological weapons. Part of its remit was to determine whether models could become deceptive and dangerous as they advance.\nAn executive order issued by the Trump administration this January revoked Biden’s order but kept the AI Safety Institute in place. “To maintain this leadership, we must develop AI systems that are free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas,” the executive order states.\nSpeaking at the AI Action Summit in Paris in February, vice president JD Vance said that the US government will prioritize American competitiveness in the race to develop and benefit from AI. “The AI future is not going to be won by hand-wringing about safety,” Vance told attendees from around the world. The US delegation to the event did not include anyone from the AI Safety Institute.\nThe researcher who warned that the change in focus could make AI more unfair and unsafe also alleges that many AI researchers have cozied up to Republicans and their backers in an effort to still have a seat at the table when it comes to discussing AI safety. “I hope they start realizing that these people and their corporate backers are face-eating leopards who only care about power,” the researcher says.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.",

    "content_text": "Indie game developer Vivid Foundry, like many other small studios, has been struggling to stay afloat. Its debut title, Solace State, did not make the commercial splash the team had hoped for when it launched in 2023. The studio has been barely making ends meet as of late and is searching for clients and freelance gigs to keep itself afloat. For Toronto-based director and producer Tanya Kan, a huge part of that effort is a visit to the annual Game Developers Conference held each March in San Francisco.\nOr it was, until Kan and her partner Gary Kings, a game trailer maker, canceled their trip on March 12, mere days before they planned to leave. Kan and Kings, like some other international developers, no longer felt safe traveling to the United States. “We came to the conclusion that the risk of something happening to us is still relatively low, but it’s too big to ignore, especially for a games conference,” Kings says.\nEvery year, several key gaming events take place in the US, including DICE, PAX West and PAX East, Summer Games Fest, and GDC; it was also the home of the now defunct E3. Although each event is different, they are often a place for developers to connect with peers, pitch platforms and publishers, work on professional development, and show off their work. In the days leading up to GDC, however, Trump’s comments about annexation and Canada as a “51st state,” as well as calling its border “an artificial line” drawn on a map; rising tensions amid tariff trade wars; and news reports of detainments at the American borders are increasingly making some developers nervous.\nOn LinkedIn, Hinterland founder Raphael van Lierop urged Canadian developers and colleagues to reconsider their GDC attendance. “You can no longer expect to travel to the US and return safely,” van Lierop posted. “Things are getting intense and they are going to get worse before they get better. Do not put yourself in a position where you are unable to get back into Canada, or where your Canadian citizenship is used against you.”\nVan Lierop’s post had been divisive among developers, drawing criticism from some who call it fear-mongering. Others, however, feel there are good reasons to be concerned about traveling to the United States. In the two months since his inauguration, President Donald Trump has rapidly changed US policies, leading to decreased safety around flights, passport confiscation at US borders, and mounting tensions between the US and Canada.\nEarlier this month, a Palestinian graduate student at Columbia University was arrested and detained for his involvement in pro-Palestine protests last year; the current administration now seeks to revoke the student’s green card and deport him. Van Lierop highlighted this concern in his post as well, for anyone who has “been supportive of any causes or expressed any values that run contrary to the tastes of the current administration in the US.”\nVan Lierop tells WIRED that his post is not a knock against GDC as an event, but rather the current conference that is bringing international developers into US borders. “I'm not saying you're foolish to go down there,” he says. “It's just—if you're going to go down to the States, just think about what that means, take precautions if you need to. Just be aware that this is a very dynamic situation right now. I hate to say it, but Trump is completely unpredictable.”\nVan Lierop points to Trump’s comments about Canadian annexation; his calls to “take back” the Panama Canal and plans to increase military presence in Panama; and annexation comments about Greenland. “What I want people to take away from that post is an understanding of how completely unpredictable things feel right now for us as Canadians.”\n“If you’re Canadian, you feel really under attack right now,” van Lierop says.\nIdentity Crisis\nGDC is considered an important show for developers, especially for those early in their career and looking to network. It does not carry the prestige of executive-heavy events like DICE, nor the consumer-focused role of PAX, but instead is sort of a middle ground, complete with its own annual awards show.\nConferences like GDC are also notoriously pricey. An all-access pass at its regular rate goes for $2,299; individual expo passes, which offer a limited experience, are $349. That does not account for the cost of flights, hotels, food, or other aspects of travel in an expensive city like San Francisco. A GDC trip for even a single developer can easily cost thousands of dollars; pulling out of such a trip, and potentially losing that money, is not a decision they take lightly.\nFor Kan, who is forfeiting a scholarship that allowed her to attend the event, the trip she had planned “was trying to hit a lot of different moving targets effectively just so that my studio can stay afloat.” Attending the show under current circumstances would involve more than just safely crossing the border, but keeping an eye on updates on US-Canada relations. It would overshadow the entire experience, she says.\n“Do we want to put ourselves through that kind of psychological concern?” she says of her and her partner. “Do we want to put ourselves through constantly checking our phones every moment that we're at GDC, the possibility of something unknown and unprecedented happening? That will of course detract so much away from our attention. GDC’s already complicated as a conference and something which requires basically our hundred and fifty percent energy and focus.”\n|Got a Tip?\n|Are you a current or former game developer who wants to talk about industry changes, DEI rollbacks, or anything else related to game development? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at meganfarokhmanesh.76.\nAnother international developer, Freya Holmér, tells WIRED that although she’s been to GDC several times before, she’s canceled her plans for this year’s event, which included giving a talk on math concepts and how they can be applied to games. GDC has been a great place for her to meet people, she says, adding “all of a sudden you might've just made a new connection that changes the trajectory of your company or project for the better.”\nBut the Sweden-based developer is concerned about the political direction the US has taken. “It's clear to me that the United States is rapidly heading in a fascist direction due to a party that has completely detached from reality,” Holmér says.\nThe final straw, she says, was the administration’s erasure of LGBTQ+ identities. “They just want to get rid of people like me … going through airports is stressful enough as it is as an LGBT person, but with all this, it's even worse. Even if we disregard the airport, just being in a country where, somehow, half of the electorate is signing off on what Trump is doing, is legitimately scary.”\nLook Elsewhere\nThe United States has long acted as a hub for gaming, but it may not remain one if international developers don’t want to do business in Trump’s America. WIRED previously reported that trans and gender-nonconforming developers both domestically and abroad were already concerned about their ability to work safely in the industry. Those concerns are spreading.\n“With the way the United States is going right now, I don't think it's possible to invite international guests [there] and have them feel safe, especially those of minority groups like myself,” Holmér says. “I'd love to see the epicenter of game development move out of the US, at least during these times.”\nWIRED reached out to GDC organizers to ask if they had received requests for refunds or heard from developers who felt they could not safely travel to the US. “GDC 2025 is on pace to deliver another strong event, with overall attendance tracking in line with previous years, expo registrations up [year-over-year], and steady enthusiasm from attendees who have registered or are actively planning their time at the event,” spokesperson Brian Rubin-Sowers says.\nVan Lierop says to weather this moment, the game industry needs to look beyond the US. “I think for our own survival as an industry group, we need to be more internationally minded,” he says. “We need to understand more about how to make games for a global audience. And we can't really afford to be so North American–centric.”\nHinterland, van Lierop says, will not be traveling to the States anytime soon in any official capacity. Van Lierop says that while he won’t be telling team members what to do, he doesn’t feel that it’s safe or responsible to travel into the US to do business. “Not everybody on my team is a white male, and I'm responsible for all of them,” he says. “I don't think we can feel confident that someone who's gay or has expressed certain political beliefs in their social media even could confidently travel down to the US right now and feel like they would make it back over the border without potentially some issues.”\nReasonable people, van Lierop says, “can't rely on the expectation that things are going to function as they have for the last hundred years, that things are just normal … that people will behave motivated by common sense and logic and reason.”",

Learn more.\nHisense didn’t bring many TVs to CES 2025, but what did make the journey may well be a sign of the future of display technology. The brand’s 116-inch RGB LED TV, dubbed the UX Trichroma TV, uses a new kind of RGB (red, green, and blue) LED lighting system with the potential to shake up the market. The system can’t turn each tiny pixel on or off like OLED or micro-LED, but it offers still-striking contrast alongside incredible brightness, fantastic accuracy, and other intriguing benefits.\nHot on its heels, Sony revealed its own RGB LED prototype at a Tokyo press event I attended in late February 2025. As with Hisense, Sony's new screen tech, set for an ambiguous 2026 release, showed serious improvements across the board over traditional LED TVs. The secret behind this new technology's brilliance is in the colors.\nUpdated March 2025: We’ve added new information following hands-on time with Sony’s new RGB LED prototype, potential plans for a 2026 Sony product release, and other new display tech.\nWhat Is RGB LED?\nIt's all about the backlighting. Traditional LED TVs produce white or blue light run through color filters and an LCD panel to create an image. The best models combat light spillage from bright objects on dark backgrounds using multiple dimming zones (called local dimming) and thousands of increasingly small LEDs. Yet, even the best LED TVs will produce noticeable light bleed (or haloing) around bright images, while providing less striking contrast than emissive light sources that provide a perfectly black backdrop like OLED and micro-LED, where each pixel is its own backlight.\nUnlike today's traditional LED backlight systems, RGB LED panels use thousands of red, green, and blue LED modules to produce “pure colors directly at the source.” According to Hisense, this results in the “widest color gamut ever achieved in a mini-LED display.” Its new TV is claimed to produce 97 percent of the BT.2020 color space, the most expansive display color standard available. Sony's system provides similarly impressive advancements, including a higher color bit rate for richer saturation and greatly improved color accuracy. Sony says its new tech “enables faithful reproduction of delicate hues and subtle gradations of light across every corner of the display.” RGB LED provides other performance advantages too.\nBecause an RGB panel produces colors at the light source in concert with color filters, RGB TVs get fantastically bright while offering enhanced backlight control and greatly reduced light bleed for improved contrast. Hisense calls this technique “RGB local dimming,” as opposed to traditional LED-based local dimming.\nIn theory—and in the brief time I spent with these new panels at CES in Las Vegas and Sony's labs in Tokyo—RGB tech provides deeper black levels and better contrast alongside more expansive colors than current LED TVs, even giving OLED and micro-LED a run for the money.\nRGB vs. OLED: The Brightness Wars of 2025\nIt’s hard to beat OLED TVs for sheer picture performance right now. OLED’s blend of perfect black levels, near-infinite contrast, excellent off-axis viewing, and expansive colors powers the best TVs you can buy. Yet for all its advantages, OLED has limitations—namely, brightness levels that can’t match the most potent LED TVs.\nThat might sound dismissive, considering that the best OLED TVs are already searingly bright in a vacuum. Top 2024 flagships like Panasonic’s Z95A (9/10, WIRED Recommends), LG’s G4, and Samsung’s S95D (8/10, WIRED Recommends) all get remarkably close to 2,000 nits peak brightness, outshining the brightest LED TVs from just a few years back. An upgrade for 2025 could potentially push the latest models past that 2,000 nit milestone. In fact, the latest panels from Samsung Display and LG Display claim to get as bright as 4,000 nits in very small windows (though this seems unlikely to translate for real-world content).\nEven so, LED TVs maintain a brightness advantage, with last year's models like TCL’s QM8 and Hisense's U9 already managing to top 4,000 and 5,000 nits peak brightness, respectively. That may sound like overkill right now, where most content is mastered for a max 1,000 nits peak brightness, but new tools like Sony’s HX3110 master monitor will more easily allow producers to master video at up to 4,000 nits to make small highlights like sunlight reflecting on water look more realistic. As Sony engineer Hugo Gaggioni puts it, brightness when properly controlled “becomes a new color accuracy weapon.” That's a big reason we’re seeing an explosion in TV panel innovation across the industry.\nAt a stunning 10,000 nits peak brightness, displays like Hisense’s UX Trichroma should have no trouble sustaining remarkably high average picture level (APL) and fiery peak brightness for the next step in HDR video. That much potency likely also contributes to its incredible color accuracy, alongside its ability to produce colors directly at the light source. Though I wouldn't expect all future RGB TVs to hit those numbers right away, it’s easy to see the advantages of this technology as it trickles down into more affordable TV models.\nSony goes beyond brightness in comparing RGB to OLED, boasting its next-level color gradation control. As Sony puts it, “The [RGB LED] system can achieve what is challenging for existing OLED panels: the expression of colors with moderate brightness and saturation.” In other words, colors look more accurate, even in low-lit scenes. In the few scenes I saw at Sony's RGB LED demo, the prototype panel clearly outclassed the stunning 2023 Sony OLED flagship, the A95L (9/10, WIRED Recommends), in color saturation. The OLED still held the advantage in black levels and image focus, but it was an impressive demonstration of RGB LED's skills.\nBrightness and color accuracy aside, RGB LED may be a good alternative for those worried about OLED burn-in. OLED’s makeup of organic compounds can degrade at different rates over time, leading to potential variations in brightness and color. Burn-in is increasingly less common in modern OLEDs, so it's not something we worry about for most viewers, but it remains a concern over the life of an OLED display, especially for users like high-volume gamers where static images are consistently onscreen.\nWhat About Micro-LED?\nLike OLED, micro-LED is emissive, with each tiny pixel able to turn on or off individually for near-infinite contrast. Since it doesn’t use organic compounds, it isn’t subject to the same burn-in concerns as OLED. It's able to get much brighter too—Hisense’s 136-inch micro-LED TV, also unveiled at CES 2025, offers the same claimed 10,000 nits peak brightness as its RGB TV. For all these reasons, many view micro-LED as the display technology of the future.\nWhile micro-LED has theoretically been nipping at the heels of LED and OLED technologies for years now, in practice it remains elusive. Due to its use of millions of tiny LEDs that must be individually placed, it’s incredibly difficult to produce at scale. Apple famously abandoned the technology for the Apple Watch (for now, anyway), and though Samsung has been producing and selling micro-LED TVs for the past couple of years, you’ll pay six figures for the privilege.\nIn addition, the current micro-LED manufacturing process requires using multiple modular panels for larger screens, resulting in visible lines. Hisense’s own micro-LED TV was incredibly striking from a distance, but up close I couldn’t help noticing small gaps between the modular panels, reducing the overall wow factor.\nRGB LED doesn’t suffer from these drawbacks. It’s easier (and likely much cheaper) to produce than micro-LED, and it doesn’t require modular panels. While its thousands of mini-LED clusters can't provide the same contrast as micro-LED’s millions of lights, its potency provides the same striking brightness alongside remarkable color accuracy. Even off-axis performance appears strong so far, a common challenge for traditional LED TVs.\nIs QDEL a Thing Yet?\nTo add another display wrinkle, there's been much excitement in TV-enthusiast circles about a new display type on the move called Nano LED or QDEL, which stands for quantum dot eluminiscent. This latest confusing screen acronym uses quantum dots similar to the ones currently leveraged in some OLED and LED TVs to improve colors, but instead of enhancing colors for another display type, they're excited with electricity to create light at the pixel level like OLED and micro-LED displays.\nThis new emissive display type is being heralded as a potential OLED replacement due to advantages like burn-in resistance and a theoretical boost in brightness. QDEL should eventually be less expensive and complex to manufacture than micro-LED, though it may not be as cost-effective as RGB LED. It's still a nascent technology, and we don't expect even a prototype at the TV level for a couple of years, so for now it's simply another new technology to keep tabs on.\nThe Race Is On\nHisense and Sony aren't the only brands showing off innovative RGB technology. Samsung brought a new prototype to CES 2025, proclaiming its own RGB tech called “RGB MicroLED,” which seems to operate in a similar principle to both rival panels, albeit with some potentially complex differences.\nI reached out to Samsung for a statement about its new prototype. “Unlike conventional LED TVs that rely on white backlighting, this product uses micro-sized RGB (red, blue, and green) LEDs to control each color independently,” says Lydia Cho, head of product for home entertainment at Samsung Electronics America. “This results in sharper, deeper, and more vibrant colors than ever before. This breakthrough technology marks the future of display technology, specifically showcasing the potential for even more color accuracy and vibrancy.”\nWhile Samsung reps couldn’t tell me much more about the prototype, PR reps on the show floor claimed it isn’t emissive tech like traditional micro-LED. They also said that Samsung’s RGB tech may be leveraged to bridge the gap between traditional LED TVs and the much-hyped vision for micro-LED as the future of display technology.\nThe Screens of the Future?\nWith so many potential advantages to this new mini-LED RGB tech, the future of TV may be taking shape right in front of us. Hisense's RGB UX Trichroma TV is slated for availability in 2025, with Sony and (at some point) Samsung to follow. While neither brand has announced an official launch, Sony points to 2025 mass production and a 2026 road map. Hisense product experts hinted that we could see the tech land in more of its models in the next few years.\nBased on what we know about this tech so far, it seems poised to spawn yet another battleground in the TV “brightness wars.” If it performs (and arrives) as expected, RGB’s obvious advantages in color accuracy, brightness, dimming control, and scalability all seem poised to make it a leader in the race for the best TV for your dollars.\nIt’s early days for RGB displays, and way too soon to count out other new display technologies—or OLED, for that matter, which stands as the best TV tech real people can buy right now, and continues to evolve. We’ll find out a lot more in the next few years, but we expect that the future is brighter, cheaper, and better looking. Hisense’s first Trichroma display is slated to land this year—and its future looks impressive indeed.",

    "content_text": "It was Meta itself that first told me about the new book attacking Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and the allegedly bankrupt morals of their company. On March 7, a Meta PR person contacted me to ask if I’d heard about Careless People, a presumed takedown of the company that was due for release in a few days. I hadn’t. No one at Meta had read the book yet, but the comms department was already proactively debunking it, issuing a statement that the author was a former employee who had been “terminated” in 2017.\nMy first thought was Wow, I’ve got to read this book! And in fact I did, devouring it in a night as soon as it was published. With the benefit of attention from Meta’s complaints, I suspect Careless People might become a must-read. Meta—the company that promotes itself as an avatar of free speech—has successfully convinced an arbitrator to silence author Sarah Wynn-Williams, who was a director in charge of connecting Meta’s executives with global leaders. The ruling, relying on an NDA signed after Wynn-Williams was fired, demands she stop promoting the book, do everything in her power to stop its publication, and retract all comments “disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental” about Meta. That’s pretty much the whole book. Wynn-Williams, who has registered as a whistleblower with the SEC, did not attend the hearing and doesn’t seem inclined to respect it. As I write this, Careless People is now the third-best-selling book on Amazon.\nThe arbitrator’s Meta-friendly “emergency” ruling was the climax of an intense campaign against the book that erupted once the company got a look at it. Even as I turned the pages of Careless People, my inbox was fattening with dispatches from Meta. “Her book is a mix of old claims and false accusations about our executives,” a company spokesperson says. They characterize her firing as the result of “poor performance and toxic behavior.” They call her “a disgruntled activist trying to sell books.” Meanwhile on social media, current and former employees posted comments defending the maligned executives.\nIf the news is so old, one might ask why is Meta going nuclear on Wynn-Williams? For one thing, its author was a senior executive who was in the room, and on the corporate jet, when stuff happened—and she claims that things were worse than we imagined. Yes, Meta’s reckless disregard in Myanmar, where people died in riots triggered by misinformation posted on Facebook, was previously reported, and the company has since apologized. But Wynn-Williams’ storytelling paints a picture where Meta’s leaders simply didn’t care much about the dangers there. While the media has written about Zuckerberg’s obsession with getting Facebook into China, Wynn-Williams shares official documents that show Meta instructing the Chinese government on face recognition and AI, and says that the company’s behavior was so outrageous that the team crafted headlines to show what the company would have to deal with if their plans leaked. One example: “Zuckerberg Will Stop at Nothing to Get Into China.” While making blanket statements that the book can’t be trusted, Meta hasn’t denied all these allegations specifically. (In general, when a company tries to dismiss charges as “old news,” that translates to a confirmation.)\nStill, in the context of what we know about Meta already, nothing Wynn-Williams says about the company’s actions and inactions is shockingly new. Careless People is not an investigative work, but a memoir, with the narrative thread being the observed callousness of the company’s leaders. Given this personal focus, it’s no wonder that Careless People’s most memorable moments come not from Meta’s substandard corporate morals, but gossipy anecdotes of misbehavior on the corporate plane or at luxury hotels. Despite the lofty F. Scott Fitzgerald title reference, much of the book reads like a Big Tech–themed episode of White Lotus. Wynn-Williams says that Sheryl Sandberg pressured her to share a bed mid-air, that Meta’s chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan called her “sultry” and grinded against her while dad-dancing at a corporate retreat. (This led her to file a sexual harassment claim that Meta now says was “misleading and unfounded.”) Also, Mark Zuckerberg thinks Andrew Jackson was the greatest president because he “got stuff done.”\nCan she be trusted? Meta calls Wynn-Williams an unreliable narrator, and she is certainly self-interested. I tend to think that she isn’t making things up but spinning events in the least favorable light for her subjects and the most favorable light for herself. And though she may not admit it, she’s one of the careless people too. By her own account, she was the Susan Collins of Facebook’s policy team, wringing her hands over morally questionable practices, and sometimes offering objections—but ultimately going with the flow. She says that for years she plotted an escape but couldn’t afford to leave the job and the medical coverage due to her serious health issues. Since she was a director of global public policy who made millions of dollars in compensation, and California includes preexisting conditions for private health insurance, that doesn’t ring true. She stuck around until she got canned. By then, according to her own account, she was slow-walking her efforts because she disagreed with the policies of her bosses.\nMeta will be happy that I point all this out. But none of this exonerates the people who lead the company. Meta’s sweeping condemnation of the book, which includes very little in the way of documentable evidence, fails to tarnish Careless People as an act of fiction.\nMy question to Meta is, why bother to roll out the cannons to blast this tome? The effort to neutralize the book seems quaint and futile. For one thing, NDAs do not cancel out the first amendment. In a statement, the publisher, Macmillian, says, “We are appalled by Meta’s tactics to silence our author through the use of a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement.” The book is still on sale and the author will continue the disparagement, only now as the victim of a trillion-dollar company’s attempt to silence her.\nThe whole effort is totally unnecessary. This is a company that has had every nasty charge thrown against it for almost a decade and just keeps getting bigger and more profitable. Its CEO now trolls critics by wearing triumphalist clothing and going on Joe Rogan to celebrate masculinity. The campaign against Careless People seems defensive and out of step. One of Meta’s big complaints is that Wynn-Williams did not undergo a prepublication rundown of the text with the company. Please pause for a moment to savor the irony. Meta, the company that recently announced an end to fact-checking in posts seen by potentially millions of people, is griping that an author didn’t fact-check with them?\nThere might have been a time in history—like a decade ago—when matters of veracity were determined by an empirically driven point/counterpoint process, and the best facts won. That time is over—in large part due to Facebook itself, which has been a major force in promoting false narratives that seem to stick, even after they are thoroughly debunked. When I wrote my own book about Facebook, I spent thousands of dollars on a fact-checking team, and I submitted a long document to the company asking for verification on all I had found. But those who live in the world where facts matter are a diminishing minority.\nNow that I think of it, Meta’s actions against Wynn-Williams might be less about defending its reputation than a need to punish a defector who violated her promise to keep its secrets. The campaign seems at one with the desire of the White House’s current occupant to pursue vindication at all costs. As opposed as they may seem, Mark Zuckerberg and Sarah Wynn-Williams both understand something fundamental about our time: Careless people rule the world.\nUpdate: 3/17/25 11:30am ET: This story has been updated to clarify Wynn-Williams' full title and compensation, per reporting.",

    "content_text": "All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Learn more.\nWho needs vaccines and Vanicream, when you have raw milk and beef tallow? That’s what the internet thinks, anyway. TikTok (or TallowTok) is currently slathered with devotees hailing beef tallow (yes, the rendered fat from a cow) as a miracle moisturizer. As of March 2025, there have been more than 68.5 million posts on tallow. Brands cash in, while influencers flaunt before-and-after transformations, render tallow from suet, or smear beef lard on their skin, thinking it’s tallow (it’s not).\nThe backlash against industrialized beauty mirrors anxieties about ultra-processed food. The same people avoiding seed oils in their diets are now seeking beef-fat balms for their faces—it’s not a coincidence that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is selling “Making Frying Oil Tallow Again” merch. But in a rush to eliminate toxins and stick it to big corporations, you may have overlooked other risks. I bought some on the internet and smeared it on myself to figure it out.\nA Brief History of Tallow\nCow fat as face cream is not as far out as you might think. For centuries, terrestrial animal fats—beef tallow, lard, and lanolin—were staples in skin care. The Babylonians used ash and rendered fat to craft soap. Over time, tallow found its way into early-candle-making and medicinal remedies. Nineteenth-century ointments relied on them to treat everything from burns and chapped skin to wounds and ingrown nails. Traditional soap was a mix of tallow and coconut oil, and early lipsticks blended animal fat and beeswax. Some tattoo artists will still recommend beef tallow soaps to better preserve ink.\nBy the 1990s, advances in cosmetic chemistry favored plant-based and synthetic alternatives that offered greater stability and consistency. Safety concerns surrounding bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) also prompted companies to distance themselves from animal-derived ingredients. Though byproducts like collagen, hyaluronic acid, and keratin evolved with modern skin care, tallow was (mostly) left behind.\nBut now, beef tallow is back.\nThis revival is part of a cultural obsession with ancestral living. It’s the same impulse driving the popularity of the carnivore diet, bone broth, and unpasteurized milk. Grand View Research reports that the U.S. tallow market brought in $627.9 million in 2023 and is projected to surpass $1 billion by 2030. At its core is the rejection of modernity, the belief that industrialization has corrupted nature and that the past held purer solutions. The beauty industry, with its preservatives, emulsifiers, and laboratory formulations, has become the enemy. Tallow, by contrast, is framed as a return to the untainted.\nBeef tallow is rich in triglycerides and also contains essential vitamins A, D, K, E, and B12. Some studies suggest that tallow can increase fatty acid concentration in the skin, making it a moisturizing agent. However, comparative studies have found that alternatives like pumpkin seed oil and linoleic acid offer superior hydration. While some might tout its “natural” benefits, that word is more marketing than fact.\nRetailers like Sephora, Ulta Beauty, and Whole Foods have their own “clean” beauty standards, each with different ingredient bans. The FDA doesn’t approve cosmetics before they hit the market, meaning labels like “clean” and “toxin-free” are pretty much meaningless.\nFace Full of Meat\nI’m not scared of beef tallow. I’ve willingly slathered snail mucin on my skin (and I still do). But I did take a few steps after ordering a jar of this ancient beauty remedy via Amazon Prime. (Side note: This product is no longer available on Amazon or the company’s site, which is concerning.) For example, I decided to use it only at night, reasoning that the last thing I needed was to smell like meat sweats during my morning workout.\nMy immediate reaction was yuck. It looked like curdled cheese but, surprisingly, didn’t smell like much. I applied it quickly and went straight to bed before I could dwell on the fact that I had basted myself. To my surprise, I woke each morning to skin that felt soft and hydrated. My seasonal seborrheic dermatitis didn’t flare up as much, but I also broke out more than usual.\nNothing really bad happened to me in the week that I tried it (except that I grossed out my partner and myself), but I may have gotten lucky. There have been a few recalls on commercially produced tallow, and DIY tallow skin care, in particular, raises red flags.\nRendering animal fat requires careful heating and purification to remove impurities. Without proper sterilization, bacterial contamination is a serious concern. Plus, tallow’s composition varies depending on the animal’s diet and processing method, making it almost impossible to predict how an individual’s skin will react. More research is needed to understand how different skin types respond to tallow, as existing studies use varied methodologies and reference points.\nWhile tallow does have moisturizing properties, its occlusive nature isn’t ideal for all skin types, especially oily or acne-prone individuals. Animal fats are rich in saturated fatty acids, which can be comedogenic and exacerbate breakouts for certain skin types. Tallow can also trigger dermatitis or allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.\nIn the end, beef tallow’s resurgence isn’t really about skin care—it’s about trust, control, and the desire to strip away the complexities of consumerism. It’s easy to romanticize the past when you don’t have to live in it. But just because something is natural doesn’t mean it’s better. After all, we don’t put lead in makeup anymore. If you’re still tempted to smear cow fat on your face, consult a dermatologist before overhauling your skin care routine.",

A heated blanket can speed up the process of waiting for your bed to warm up, especially on cold nights.

Subscribe Today.\nHow I Tested\nI used each blanket for a minimum of three hours, both while lounging and while napping. I tested each feature and compared the softness, ease of use, durability, number of heat settings, and more factors to make my picks.\nHeated Blanket Safety, Explained\nElectric blankets—especially ones older than 10 years old—have become a bit infamous for being fire hazards. But when it comes to safety, modern heated blankets have come leaps and bounds past their predecessors. Look for independently tested blankets and bedding that have met safety standards (such UL or ETL). These agencies ensure that the blankets can handle wear and tear, that they don’t get too hot, that they’re machine washable, and more.\nMake sure to treat electric blankets gently. You don’t want to fold them tightly, ball them up, or otherwise damage the inner electric components. You shouldn’t use heavy bedding on top of heated blankets or wrap them too closely around your body—it can cause overheating. (I experienced this when I fell asleep underneath mine wrapped up like a burrito and woke up hours later drenched in sweat.)\nYou shouldn’t plug your blanket into an extension cord, and you should never leave the blanket on if you’re not using it. Keep it out of reach of pets, kids, or anyone with reduced heat sensitivity who might not be able to tell if they’re getting too hot. Make sure the heated blanket is fully dry after washing before you use it again. And finally, be on the lookout for anything amiss, like strange smells or spotty performance. If you encounter these scenarios, immediately unplug the blanket and reach out to the manufacturer for further instructions.",

It has adjustable dual controls for each side, split right down the middle. It warms up quickly—I notice it getting warmer immediately after turning it on, a mark of its high quality. The power cords are plenty long—from the controller to the blanket, 150 inches, and from the controller to the plug, 160 inches. The cords come out of the bottom of the blanket. The oval-shaped controller is easy to use: Dial the heat from ”low” to ”high” with nine levels of heat in between, then press the button to turn it on.</p><p>Note that the warm light from the controller stays on while the blanket it in use, but I didn’t find it to be too bright, and it certainly wasn’t disruptive. Each side of the blanket has its own heating components, so your partner’s heat selection won’t affect yours or make you overheat. The polyester fabric feels soft and plush to the touch, and the heating components go almost all the way to the outer edge of the blanket. They’re not super noticeable or rigid. Overall, this blanket is soft, it’s easy to use even for two people, and it will keep you warm no matter how cold it is outside. I do wish it was less expensive, but there are cheaper options on the market if this is out of your budget.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Color options</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Size options</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Heating cycle options</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Automatic shutoff time</td><td>10 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Safety certification</td><td>ETL</td></tr><tr><td>Machine washable?</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></body></html>",
